# Acarbose + Metformin

## **Usage**

Acarbose + Metformin is an oral antidiabetic combination medication prescribed for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults. It is specifically indicated when diet and exercise alone do not adequately control blood glucose levels. This combination therapy belongs to the pharmacological classifications of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose) and biguanides (metformin).

Acarbose works by inhibiting alpha-glucosidase, an enzyme in the small intestine responsible for breaking down complex carbohydrates into glucose. This action delays glucose absorption, reducing postprandial hyperglycemia. Metformin works by decreasing hepatic glucose production, reducing intestinal glucose absorption, and improving insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues.

## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination. However, individual components are sometimes referred to by their chemical names. Several brand names market this combination.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Acarbose acts locally in the small intestine by competitively and reversibly inhibiting alpha-glucosidase enzymes. It does not affect the absorption of other disaccharides such as sucrose, lactose, or fructose. Metformin primarily acts in the liver by suppressing hepatic gluconeogenesis, the process of producing glucose. It also improves insulin sensitivity, allowing peripheral tissues to utilize glucose more effectively.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Acarbose is minimally absorbed systemically, with most of the drug remaining in the gastrointestinal tract. It is metabolized by intestinal bacteria and excreted in the feces. Metformin is absorbed from the small intestine, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 2-3 hours. It is not metabolized and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.

**Mode of Action:** Acarbose directly inhibits alpha-glucosidase, preventing the breakdown and absorption of complex carbohydrates. Metformin's mechanism is not fully understood, but it is thought to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which plays a role in regulating cellular energy metabolism and insulin signaling.

**Elimination Pathways:** Acarbose is primarily eliminated via fecal excretion, while metformin is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Initial dose: Acarbose 25 mg + Metformin 500 mg orally three times daily with the first bite of each main meal.

The dosage can be titrated upwards at 4- to 8-week intervals based on blood glucose control and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of acarbose is 100 mg three times daily for patients weighing >60 kg and 50 mg three times daily for patients weighing ≤60 kg. The maximum recommended daily dose of metformin is 2550 mg.

#### **Children:**

The safety and efficacy of this combination have not been established in children under 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a low dose and titrate cautiously, considering renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Metformin is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m²). Dose adjustments are necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Acarbose is contraindicated in patients with cirrhosis. Metformin should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Adjust the dosage based on individual patient factors and coexisting medical conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is not indicated for use in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) use, or emergency situations. 

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal function, hepatic function, and other patient-specific factors.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Gastrointestinal disturbances are the most common side effects, including flatulence, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and borborygmus. These side effects are usually transient and can be minimized by starting with a low dose and titrating slowly.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hepatic dysfunction (rare)
* Lactic acidosis (metformin) – rare but potentially life-threatening
* Hypoglycemia (when combined with insulin or sulfonylureas)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term use may lead to vitamin B12 deficiency (metformin).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and hepatic dysfunction are serious ADRs that warrant immediate medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to acarbose or metformin
* Diabetic ketoacidosis
* Severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m²)
* Cirrhosis
* Inflammatory bowel disease
* Colonic ulceration
* Conditions that may be worsened by increased gas formation in the GI tract


## **Drug Interactions**

* Insulin and other antidiabetic medications: Increased risk of hypoglycemia.
* Intestinal adsorbents (e.g., charcoal): Decreased absorption of acarbose.
* Digestive enzyme preparations: Decreased efficacy of acarbose.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Metformin is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but acarbose should be used with caution. Consult a healthcare professional for appropriate advice during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Acarbose: Inhibits alpha-glucosidase. Metformin: Reduces hepatic glucose production, increases insulin sensitivity.
* **Side Effects:** Gastrointestinal disturbances, hypoglycemia (with insulin or sulfonylureas), lactic acidosis (rare), hepatic dysfunction (rare), vitamin B12 deficiency (long-term metformin use).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, DKA, severe renal/hepatic impairment, bowel disorders.
* **Drug Interactions:** Insulin, sulfonylureas, intestinal adsorbents, digestive enzymes.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution, consult healthcare professional.
* **Dosage:** Individualized based on patient factors; start low, titrate slowly.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  HbA1c, fasting and postprandial glucose levels, renal function, liver function tests, vitamin B12 levels.


## **Popular Combinations**

Acarbose + Metformin is itself a popular combination.

## **Precautions**

Monitor renal and hepatic function, blood glucose levels, and vitamin B12 levels regularly.  Educate patients on dietary modifications and potential side effects. Counsel patients on the importance of adherence to prescribed medications, diet, and exercise for optimal blood glucose control.

## **FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)**


### **Q1: What is the recommended dosage for Acarbose + Metformin?**

**A:**  Initial dose: 25 mg acarbose + 500 mg metformin three times daily with meals. Titrate every 4-8 weeks based on glucose control and tolerability, up to a maximum of 100 mg acarbose (or 50 mg for patients ≤60 kg) and 2550 mg metformin daily.
