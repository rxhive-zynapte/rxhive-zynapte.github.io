## **Usage**

Acebrophylline + Acetylcysteine is prescribed for respiratory conditions characterized by thick mucus secretions and airway obstruction.  It is primarily indicated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It can also be used in asthma, bronchiectasis, and pulmonary complications of cystic fibrosis.  

This combination belongs to the pharmacological classifications of mucolytics (Acetylcysteine), bronchodilators (Acebrophylline), and expectorants (Acebrophylline).

Acebrophylline, a derivative of theophylline, acts as a bronchodilator by relaxing the smooth muscles in the airways. Additionally, it exhibits mucoregulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Acetylcysteine works by breaking down disulfide bonds in mucus, reducing its viscosity and making it easier to expectorate.  It also possesses antioxidant properties.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Acebrophylline + Acetylcysteine" is the generic name, various brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region. Some examples include Thiotrac N, Respronoc, Aphyren N, Brophyle N, and Mucomix Ace.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Acebrophylline relaxes bronchial smooth muscle, leading to bronchodilation.  It also exerts anti-inflammatory effects. Acetylcysteine reduces mucus viscosity by breaking down disulfide bonds. It also acts as a direct and indirect antioxidant, potentially protecting lung tissue from oxidative damage.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Both drugs are absorbed orally.  Acebrophylline is metabolized in the liver, while Acetylcysteine is rapidly metabolized, primarily in the liver and kidneys. Elimination pathways include renal and hepatic excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  One tablet (Acebrophylline 100mg + Acetylcysteine 600mg) twice daily is a common dosage regimen.


#### **Children:** Use in children under 12 years is generally not recommended. For children older than 6, dosing should be carefully determined by a healthcare professional and is usually lower than adult doses.



#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution and consider dosage adjustments.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution and consider dosage adjustments.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions (e.g. heart failure, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcers):** Careful monitoring and potential dosage adjustments are necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific clinical settings should be determined by the physician based on individual patient needs.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications should be considered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, other comorbid conditions, and those using interacting medications.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, heartburn, stomach discomfort, dizziness, headache, and skin rash.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), bronchospasm (especially in asthmatics), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and liver damage.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic use can potentially lead to liver or kidney issues.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

ADRs requiring immediate attention include severe allergic reactions, bronchospasm, and serious skin reactions.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to acebrophylline, acetylcysteine, theophylline, or any component of the formulation; acute myocardial infarction; severe hypotension; hemodynamic instability; arrhythmias; acute porphyria; severe liver and kidney dysfunction are contraindications.


## **Drug Interactions**

Acebrophylline + Acetylcysteine can interact with several drugs, including certain antibiotics, antihypertensives, diuretics, antacids, anticoagulants, and some over-the-counter medications. Notably, interactions may occur with theophylline and other xanthine derivatives. Alcohol may enhance drowsiness.  Histamine-rich foods may exacerbate allergic reactions in susceptible individuals.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Acebrophylline + Acetylcysteine is generally not recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential risks to the fetus or neonate. Safer alternatives should be considered.
