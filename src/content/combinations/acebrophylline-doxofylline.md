## **Usage**

Acebrophylline + Doxofylline is prescribed for the symptomatic management of respiratory conditions like:

*   **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD):** This combination helps manage symptoms like breathlessness, wheezing, and chronic cough, and improves lung function.
*   **Asthma:** It is effective in controlling asthma symptoms, preventing asthma attacks, and improving overall respiratory function.
*   **Bronchitis:** It alleviates symptoms of bronchitis, including coughing and difficulty in breathing.
*   **Bronchospasm:**  It is indicated for prophylaxis and symptomatic treatment of bronchospasm.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Bronchodilator, Mucolytic (Acebrophylline)

**Mechanism of Action:** Acebrophylline decreases the thickness and stickiness of lung secretions, making them easier to cough up. It also has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that reduce airway inflammation. Doxofylline, a xanthine derivative, relaxes the bronchial tubes' muscles, leading to bronchodilation and improved airflow. It does this by blocking phosphodiesterases, raising intracellular cyclic AMP levels, causing smooth muscle relaxation in the airways.  Doxofylline has minimal activity on adenosine receptors, which contributes to a reduced side effect profile compared to other xanthines.

## **Alternate Names**

While the generic name is Acebrophylline + Doxofylline,  it is marketed under various brand names, including S PHYLLIN DX, Doxocar-AC and Spirodin-AB.



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Acebrophylline acts as a mucolytic agent, reducing the viscosity of mucus and facilitating its expulsion. It also possesses anti-inflammatory properties, further aiding in airway opening. Doxofylline, on the other hand, primarily acts as a bronchodilator by relaxing the smooth muscles in the airways.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Acebrophylline and doxofylline is administered orally.  The exact mechanisms of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion for the combination aren't detailed in the provided sources, however it's likely that the liver plays a significant role in metabolizing both components, and elimination is likely primarily renal. The effects of the combination are primarily localized to the respiratory system. Specific details regarding receptor binding or neurotransmitter modulation for this combination were not found in the sources.



## **Dosage**

Dosage guidelines can vary depending on patient factors and local practices. Always refer to local guidelines and individual product information. The following is a general guide based on available information, primarily relevant to adult patients:

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard dosage commonly cited is one tablet of Acebrophylline 100mg + Doxofylline 400mg twice daily. It's often recommended to take the medication after meals to minimize gastrointestinal discomfort.

#### **Children:**

Acebrophylline + Doxofylline is generally not recommended for children under 12 years of age. Safety and effectiveness in younger children have not been established. Some sources specifically advise against use in children under 6.  When prescribed for children 12 years and older,  dosage is usually adjusted based on weight or age, with lower doses than adult doses.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Dosage reduction may be necessary.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage reduction is likely required.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustments are likely needed due to potential impaired metabolism.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution and potential dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, heart failure, arrhythmias), hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer disease, seizure disorders, or concomitant infections.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Specific dosage recommendations for clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations were not found in the provided sources.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and in patients with specific comorbid conditions as noted above. Dosage may also need to be adjusted in smokers.
