## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the relief of coughs accompanied by mucus (chesty coughs), often associated with respiratory conditions like:

*   Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
*   Bronchitis (acute and chronic)
*   Asthma
*   Emphysema
*   Bronchiectasis
*   Common cold and other respiratory infections

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This drug is classified as an expectorant and bronchodilator combination. Acebrophylline acts as a mucolytic and bronchodilator, guaifenesin as an expectorant, and terbutaline as a bronchodilator.

**Mechanism of Action:**  Acebrophylline increases mucociliary clearance by reducing mucus viscosity and improving ciliary motility, while also exhibiting some bronchodilating effects. Guaifenesin loosens and thins mucus in the airways by increasing respiratory tract fluid secretions.  Terbutaline relaxes the smooth muscles of the airways by stimulating beta-2 adrenergic receptors, leading to bronchodilation.

## **Alternate Names**

While the generic name is Acebrophylline + Guaifenesin + Terbutaline, several brand names exist, some of which include:

*   Koffspa Active
*   Tufcuf PD Syrup
*   Venphylin Plus
*   Coughcon-XT
*   Pulmonext
*   Spartus-AP
*   Ifcof-XT
*   Mucobrint
*   Mucoday
*   Rapitus XT
*   Pulmoclear

There might be other brand names available regionally or internationally.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Acebrophylline's mucolytic action reduces sputum viscosity, making it easier to expectorate. Its bronchodilating effect is attributed to phosphodiesterase inhibition and increased cAMP levels, relaxing bronchial smooth muscles. Guaifenesin increases respiratory tract fluid, hydrating the airways and reducing mucus viscosity. Terbutaline, as a beta-2 agonist, activates receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, causing bronchodilation. It also inhibits mast cell degranulation, reducing inflammation and bronchoconstriction.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Acebrophylline is well-absorbed orally.  Guaifenesin is also readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Terbutaline is absorbed orally but undergoes significant first-pass metabolism, resulting in lower bioavailability. All three drugs are metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily through the kidneys.  

**Mode of Action:**  Acebrophylline increases intracellular cAMP, causing smooth muscle relaxation and improving mucociliary function. Guaifenesin's exact mechanism for increasing respiratory secretions is unknown but is thought to involve vagal stimulation. Terbutaline's binding to beta-2 adrenergic receptors activates adenylate cyclase, leading to increased cAMP levels, smooth muscle relaxation, and bronchodilation.

**Elimination Pathways:** All three components are primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Specific CYP enzymes involved in metabolism haven't been clearly identified in the sources.



## **Dosage**

The dosage guidelines provided here are general recommendations. Always adhere to the specific prescription provided by a physician for individual patient cases.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The usual adult dose is one to two tablets or 5-10ml of syrup, two to three times a day, or as prescribed by the physician.

#### **Children:** Dosage for children under 12 years of age should be determined and monitored by a physician.  Many sources caution against use in children younger than 12. Dosage modifications based on weight or age are required. 

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on kidney and liver function. Start with a lower dose and monitor for side effects.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is necessary based on creatinine clearance or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments are needed in patients with liver disease due to potential impact on drug metabolism.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, or seizures, and adjust the dosage accordingly.  Pre-existing heart conditions, hypertension, diabetes, thyroid disorders, or seizures require careful monitoring.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of this combination in specific clinical situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations should be decided on a case-by-case basis by the treating physician, considering the benefits and risks.  There are no specific guidelines for these situations from the sources provided.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications should be made for patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.  Always consult with a physician to determine the appropriate dosage in these situations.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Nausea, vomiting, stomach pain or discomfort, constipation, heartburn, loss of appetite
