## **Usage**

- This fixed-dose combination medication is primarily prescribed for the treatment and prevention of respiratory disorders, including:
    - Asthma (both persistent and exercise-induced)
    - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
    - Allergic Rhinitis (hay fever)

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination includes drugs from several classes:
    - Acebrophylline: Bronchodilator, Mucolytic, Anti-inflammatory
    - Levocetirizine: Antihistamine (second-generation)
    - Montelukast: Leukotriene Receptor Antagonist

- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination medication employs a multi-pronged approach to address respiratory issues.
    - Acebrophylline widens the airways, making breathing easier.  It also exerts anti-inflammatory effects within the lungs and enhances mucus clearance.
    - Levocetirizine blocks the action of histamine, a chemical mediator responsible for allergic symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes.
    - Montelukast inhibits leukotrienes, another set of chemical mediators involved in inflammation and airway constriction during asthma and allergic rhinitis.


## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific fixed-dose combination.  Individual drug names are standardized internationally.

- **Brand Names:** The combination is marketed under various brand names such as Brophyl LM, Montek LC, Levmont AC, and others.  Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Acebrophylline relaxes airway smooth muscle, leading to bronchodilation.  Levocetirizine antagonizes histamine H1 receptors.  Montelukast antagonizes leukotriene D4 receptors, thereby reducing inflammation and bronchoconstriction.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - *Acebrophylline:* Absorbed orally.  Metabolized in the liver.  Excreted renally.
    - *Levocetirizine:* Rapid oral absorption.  Minimal hepatic metabolism.  Primarily renal excretion.
    - *Montelukast:* Absorbed orally.  Extensively metabolized, primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9.  Excreted in bile and feces.

- **Mode of Action:**  Acebrophylline increases intracellular cAMP levels, leading to smooth muscle relaxation. Levocetirizine competitively binds to and blocks histamine H1 receptors, reducing allergic manifestations.  Montelukast competitively binds to CysLT1 receptors, inhibiting leukotriene-mediated inflammation.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly renal for Levocetirizine. Hepatic metabolism and biliary/fecal excretion for Montelukast. Hepatic metabolism and renal excretion for Acebrophylline.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** One tablet daily, typically in the evening.  Tablet strength can vary depending on individual drug components. For example, a common combination is Acebrophylline 200mg + Levocetirizine 5mg + Montelukast 10mg.

#### **Children:** Dosage is generally weight or age-based. For children 6-14 years, a common dose is 100 mg Acebrophylline, 5 mg Levocetirizine, and 4 or 5 mg Montelukast. For children under 6, consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosing.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be needed in the presence of renal or hepatic impairment.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment, particularly for Levocetirizine.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction may be needed for Montelukast and Acebrophylline.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Adjust dosages cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease, neuropsychiatric disorders, or hyperthyroidism.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations:** The use of this fixed-dose combination in these specific settings is not routinely indicated.
