## **Usage**

- This drug combination is prescribed for respiratory conditions like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and bronchiectasis.  It helps relieve symptoms like wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. It also helps to loosen and expel phlegm.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Bronchodilator, Mucolytic, Expectorant, and Organic Compound.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Acebrophylline relaxes and widens the airways, and thins mucus. Terbutaline widens the airways by relaxing the muscles around them. Menthol produces a cooling sensation and soothes throat irritation.

## **Alternate Names**

While there aren't formal alternate names for the combination itself, it's recognized by the combination of its components. Brand names include Pulmoclear,  OXYDEX, and IFCOF-XT.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Acebrophylline relaxes bronchial smooth muscle, stimulates surfactant secretion, and thins mucus. Terbutaline activates beta-2 receptors, causing bronchodilation. Menthol provides a cooling sensation and reduces throat irritation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Specific combined data is limited. Individual drug information should be considered. Generally, these drugs are absorbed orally, metabolized primarily in the liver, and excreted through the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:** Acebrophylline inhibits phosphodiesterase enzymes. Terbutaline activates beta-2 adrenergic receptors. Menthol stimulates cold receptors in the nose and throat.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion, after hepatic metabolism.
