## **Usage**

Acebrophylline + Montelukast is prescribed for the treatment and prevention of respiratory conditions such as:

* **Asthma:**  A chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm.  This combination medication helps prevent asthma attacks, including exercise-induced bronchospasm.
* **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD):**  A group of progressive lung diseases characterized by airflow limitation.  This combination may help manage symptoms like coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath.
* **Allergic Rhinitis:**  Inflammation of the nasal mucosa due to exposure to allergens, commonly known as hay fever.  This combination helps alleviate symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, and nasal congestion.
* **Bronchitis:** Inflammation of the bronchial tubes.  This combination can help in reducing inflammation and mucus production, thereby improving breathing.
* **Emphysema:** A lung condition that causes shortness of breath. While not a primary treatment, it can be used in combination with other medications.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* **Acebrophylline:**  Bronchodilator, Mucolytic, Anti-inflammatory agent
* **Montelukast:** Leukotriene Receptor Antagonist

**Mechanism of Action:**

Acebrophylline acts as a bronchodilator, relaxing the muscles in the airways to widen them.  It also possesses anti-inflammatory and mucolytic properties, reducing inflammation and thinning mucus, which aids in easier breathing. Montelukast blocks the action of leukotrienes, substances released by the body during an allergic reaction that cause inflammation and bronchoconstriction.  The combination addresses both bronchodilation and the underlying inflammatory component of these respiratory conditions.



## **Alternate Names**

This fixed-dose combination generally does not have alternate generic names. It is often referred to by its constituent drugs. However, international or regional variations may exist.


**Brand Names:** Several brands are available. Please refer to the local pharmaceutical market for specific brand names used in India.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

Acebrophylline relaxes bronchial smooth muscles, widening the airways. It inhibits phosphodiesterase, leading to increased intracellular cyclic AMP, which contributes to bronchodilation.  It also exerts anti-inflammatory effects and reduces mucus viscosity, facilitating expectoration.  Montelukast selectively blocks the CysLT1 receptor, preventing leukotriene D4 from binding and triggering inflammatory responses and bronchoconstriction.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Both drugs are orally absorbed. Acebrophylline sustained-release formulations provide prolonged action.  Montelukast absorption is not affected by food.
* **Metabolism:** Acebrophylline is metabolized in the liver.  Montelukast undergoes hepatic metabolism primarily through CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 enzymes.
* **Elimination:** Both drugs are primarily eliminated through hepatic routes.  Acebrophylline metabolites are excreted in urine.  Montelukast is excreted primarily in bile.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**

* Acebrophylline: Inhibits phosphodiesterase.
* Montelukast: CysLT1 receptor antagonist.

**Elimination Pathways:**

* Acebrophylline:  Hepatic metabolism, renal excretion of metabolites.
* Montelukast:  Hepatic metabolism, biliary excretion.



## **Dosage**

**Standard Dosage**

**Adults:** One tablet of Acebrophylline 200 mg + Montelukast 10 mg once daily, usually in the evening.

**Children:**  Dosage varies based on age and weight.  It is essential to consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosage.

* **6 months to 5 years:** Montelukast 4 mg once daily (granules or chewable tablet for children over 2 years).
* **6 to 14 years:** Montelukast 5 mg chewable tablet once daily.
* **15 years and older:** Adult dose (Acebrophylline 200 mg + Montelukast 10 mg) once daily.

**Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary depending on renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment may be required based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution and monitor liver function tests. Dosage adjustment may be needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider potential drug interactions and adjust dosage accordingly.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is generally not used in acute situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest. It is intended for long-term management and prevention of chronic respiratory conditions. It's crucial to use rescue medications for acute exacerbations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments should be based on patient's response to therapy, renal/hepatic function, and co-administered medications. Regular monitoring of liver function tests is recommended.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Headache
* Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
* Abdominal pain, discomfort
* Dizziness, drowsiness
* Skin rash, itching
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Flu-like symptoms

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Hepatic dysfunction
* Neuropsychiatric events (agitation, aggression, anxiety, depression, hallucinations, suicidal thoughts)
* Allergic reactions (angioedema, urticaria)
* Churg-Strauss Syndrome (rare systemic vasculitis)

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term use may increase the risk of neuropsychiatric effects.  Regular monitoring is essential.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to acebrophylline, montelukast, or any component of the formulation.
* Active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases.
* Acute asthma attacks.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **CYP450 interactions:** Montelukast is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9.  Concomitant use with inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes may require dosage adjustment.
* **Other drug interactions:**  Theophylline, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin, gemfibrozil, certain antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, ciprofloxacin), and other medications may interact with this combination.  A thorough medication review is essential.
