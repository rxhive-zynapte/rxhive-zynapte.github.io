## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** This combination drug is primarily prescribed for the management of pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal disorders like osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, tendinitis, bursitis, and soft tissue injuries (sprains, strains). It is also used for post-operative and post-traumatic inflammation, dental pain, and inflammation after tooth extractions.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Analgesic, Anti-inflammatory, Proteolytic enzyme combination.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Aceclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), inhibits cyclooxygenase enzymes, reducing prostaglandin production, which are mediators of pain and inflammation. Bromelain and Trypsin, proteolytic enzymes, break down proteins, increase blood flow to inflamed areas, and reduce swelling. Rutoside, a flavonoid, acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from free radical damage and reducing inflammation.


## **Alternate Names**

While there isn't a universally recognized international non-proprietary name (INN) for this specific combination, the individual components have their own INNs. This combination is often referred to by the names of its constituent drugs.

- **Brand Names:** Several brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region, including various combinations of "Trypsin," "Bromelain," "Rutoside," and "Aceclofenac," often with suffixes like "-A" or similar. Some examples noted include "Genericart," "Rutomor A," "Tryson-A," "Terrizym A," and "Flamar 3D".


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Aceclofenac reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Bromelain and trypsin decrease inflammation by breaking down proteins and increasing blood supply. Rutoside offers antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Aceclofenac is well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, and primarily excreted renally. Bromelain is absorbed orally to some extent.  Trypsin is not well absorbed orally and mostly acts locally in the gastrointestinal tract when administered orally. Rutoside is absorbed orally and metabolized. Specific pharmacokinetic parameters for the combination require further clinical investigation.
- **Mode of Action:** Aceclofenac inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, reducing prostaglandin production. Bromelain and Trypsin catalyze the breakdown of proteins involved in inflammation. Rutoside scavenges free radicals, inhibiting oxidative stress and reducing inflammation.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Aceclofenac is primarily excreted renally.  Bromelain and trypsin as oral agents are largely broken down in the digestive tract. Elimination pathways for rutoside require further investigation.


## **Dosage**

Dosage information for this combination is not consistently defined across sources and should be determined by a physician based on individual patient needs and clinical context.


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Dosage varies considerably and must be determined and prescribed by a physician on a case-by-case basis. Typical dosages observed include Aceclofenac 100mg, Bromelain 90mg, Rutoside 100mg, and Trypsin 48mg, administered twice daily after meals. However, this is not a standardized recommendation, and physicians must exercise their judgment based on the patient's condition.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, and dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with severe liver diseases/conditions.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration is needed for patients with conditions such as hypertension, heart problems, gastrointestinal disorders, or bleeding disorders. Consult a specialist where necessary.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Specific dosage recommendations for clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations are not established for this particular combination and fall under the purview of a physician's judgment and current best practices based on the particular situation.
