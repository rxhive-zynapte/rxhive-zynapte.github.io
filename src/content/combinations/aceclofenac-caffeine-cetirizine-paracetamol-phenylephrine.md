## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of common cold and flu symptoms, including fever, headache, body aches, nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.  It is also used to alleviate symptoms associated with allergies and sinusitis.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This combination includes drugs from several classes:

* **Aceclofenac:** Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID)
* **Paracetamol:** Analgesic and Antipyretic
* **Caffeine:** Central Nervous System Stimulant
* **Cetirizine:** Second-generation Antihistamine
* **Phenylephrine:** Decongestant


**Mechanism of Action:**

* **Aceclofenac:** Inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, thereby decreasing inflammation and pain.
* **Paracetamol:**  Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis in the central nervous system, reducing fever and pain.
* **Caffeine:**  Increases the analgesic effects of paracetamol and aceclofenac while reducing drowsiness caused by cetirizine. It constricts cerebral blood vessels, potentially relieving headache.
* **Cetirizine:** Blocks histamine H1 receptors, alleviating allergic symptoms such as itching, sneezing, and runny nose.
* **Phenylephrine:**  Acts as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, constricting blood vessels in the nasal mucosa, reducing nasal congestion.


## **Alternate Names**

This specific combination doesn't have a universally recognized international non-proprietary name (INN). It is generally referred to by the names of its constituents.

**Brand Names:**  Several brand names exist for this combination depending on the manufacturer and region, including "DIECOLD PLUS," "MUCOBREX AC," "ADDCET COLD," "ACCECOLD PLUS," "AFTERCOLD-A" and "Celmol-Plus".


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The combined effect of the individual components targets multiple symptoms simultaneously. Aceclofenac and paracetamol provide pain relief and reduce fever. Cetirizine addresses allergic symptoms, while phenylephrine relieves nasal congestion. Caffeine enhances the analgesic effect and counteracts cetirizine's sedative properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  All components are absorbed well orally.  
* **Metabolism:** Aceclofenac, paracetamol, and caffeine are primarily metabolized in the liver.  Cetirizine undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism. Phenylephrine is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the gastrointestinal tract and liver.
* **Elimination:**  Aceclofenac and paracetamol metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Cetirizine is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine.  Phenylephrine metabolites are excreted in the urine.

**Mode of Action (Cellular/Molecular):**  Refer to the "Mechanism of Action" section above.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  One tablet every 4-6 hours as needed. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 4-6 tablets depending on the formulation.



#### **Children:** This combination is generally not recommended for children under 12 years of age.  For children older than 12, dosage should be adjusted based on weight and age and determined by a physician.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Lower doses might be necessary due to age-related decline in renal and hepatic function. Close monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment is required based on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction may be necessary.  Close monitoring is required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, and prostatic hypertrophy.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is not typically indicated for specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  It is intended for outpatient use in the symptomatic relief of common cold and flu.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term use, especially of aceclofenac, can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and renal impairment.
