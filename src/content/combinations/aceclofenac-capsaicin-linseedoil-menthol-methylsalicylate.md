## **Usage**

This topical medication is prescribed for temporary relief of minor aches and pains in muscles and joints. It is also used to manage pain associated with:

*   Arthritis
*   Simple backache
*   Muscle strains and sprains
*   Bruises

**Pharmacological Classification:** Topical analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent.

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination product works through multiple pathways:

*   **Aceclofenac:** A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin production and thus decreasing pain and inflammation.
*   **Capsaicin:** Depletes substance P, a neurotransmitter involved in transmitting pain signals, leading to desensitization of pain receptors.
*   **Linseed Oil:**  Hydrates the skin and may provide mild anti-inflammatory effects.
*   **Menthol:** Activates TRPM8 receptors, producing a cooling sensation that masks pain perception. It also acts as a counterirritant.
*   **Methyl Salicylate:** Creates a warming sensation, acting as a counterirritant. It may also have mild analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects.



## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination.  Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Aceclofenac reduces inflammation by inhibiting COX enzymes. Capsaicin desensitizes pain receptors by depleting substance P. Menthol and methyl salicylate act as counterirritants, providing cooling and warming sensations respectively, to mask pain perception. Linseed oil moisturizes and may contribute to anti-inflammatory effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily absorbed through the skin at the application site. Systemic absorption is minimal, reducing the risk of systemic side effects.  Elimination pathways for each component vary but are primarily hepatic for aceclofenac and methyl salicylate.

**Mode of Action:**

*   **Aceclofenac:** COX enzyme inhibition.
*   **Capsaicin:** Substance P depletion.
*   **Menthol:** TRPM8 receptor activation.
*   **Methyl Salicylate:** Counterirritant, possible COX inhibition.

**Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly hepatic metabolism for aceclofenac and methyl salicylate.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer to the affected area 3-4 times daily.

#### **Children:** Not recommended for children under 12 years of age. For adolescents over 12, consult a physician.
