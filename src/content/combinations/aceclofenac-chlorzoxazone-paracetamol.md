## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the relief of pain, inflammation, and muscle spasms associated with musculoskeletal disorders such as sprains, strains, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other painful conditions.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Aceclofenac: Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID)
* Paracetamol: Analgesic and Antipyretic
* Chlorzoxazone: Centrally-acting Skeletal Muscle Relaxant

**Mechanism of Action:** Aceclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, which are mediators of pain and inflammation. Paracetamol acts centrally to relieve pain and fever. Chlorzoxazone acts on the central nervous system to depress reflexes and relax skeletal muscles, reducing muscle spasms.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no internationally recognized non-proprietary name for this specific combination. It is generally referred to by its constituent generic names.  Several brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Aceclofenac reduces inflammation and pain by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.  Paracetamol's mechanism is not fully understood but involves central inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and other pathways. Chlorzoxazone depresses polysynaptic reflexes in the spinal cord and subcortical areas of the brain, leading to muscle relaxation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Aceclofenac:** Well absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2C9. Excreted in urine and bile.
* **Paracetamol:**  Rapidly absorbed orally.  Metabolized in the liver. Excreted in urine, primarily as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.
* **Chlorzoxazone:**  Rapidly and completely absorbed orally.  Metabolized in the liver. Excreted in urine, primarily as metabolites.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**  Aceclofenac inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. Paracetamol's mechanism may involve TRPA1 receptor antagonism and endocannabinoid system modulation. Chlorzoxazone does not directly bind to muscle receptors but acts centrally.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Aceclofenac is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism followed by renal and biliary excretion. Paracetamol is mainly eliminated by hepatic metabolism followed by renal excretion.  Chlorzoxazone is mainly eliminated by hepatic metabolism followed by renal excretion of metabolites.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** One tablet two to three times a day, preferably after meals. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 200mg aceclofenac, 4g paracetamol, and 3g Chlorzoxazone.

#### **Children:** This combination is not recommended for children.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution. Initiate therapy at the lowest effective dose and monitor closely for adverse effects. Dose adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dosage adjustment may be required based on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution.  A lower initial dose of aceclofenac is recommended.  Dosage adjustment may be required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration is required in patients with cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal disorders, or other relevant conditions. Individualized dosing and close monitoring are necessary.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its primary use is for the management of musculoskeletal pain on an outpatient basis.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on patient-specific factors like renal or hepatic impairment, other medical conditions, concomitant medications, and response to therapy. Individualized dosing is essential to maximize efficacy and minimize adverse effects.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, stomach pain, diarrhea, loss of appetite, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, headache, skin rash, itching.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:** Allergic reactions (e.g., angioedema, anaphylaxis), gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, liver damage (especially with high doses of paracetamol), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis.

### **Long-Term Effects:**  Chronic use of NSAIDs like aceclofenac can increase the risk of cardiovascular events and renal impairment.  Long-term use of high doses of paracetamol can cause liver damage.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any of the components.
* Active peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Severe hepatic or renal impairment.
* Severe heart failure.
* Last trimester of pregnancy.
* History of asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.

## **Drug Interactions**

* Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin): Increased risk of bleeding.
* Methotrexate: Increased risk of methotrexate toxicity.
* Lithium: Increased lithium levels.
* Digoxin: Increased digoxin levels.
* Diuretics: Reduced diuretic effect and increased risk of renal impairment.
* Alcohol: Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and drowsiness.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Aceclofenac and Chlorzoxazone are contraindicated during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester. Aceclofenac is contraindicated during breastfeeding.  Paracetamol is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but its use should be limited to the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Aceclofenac: COX inhibitor; Paracetamol: Central analgesic and antipyretic; Chlorzoxazone: Central muscle relaxant.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, liver damage (paracetamol), gastrointestinal bleeding (aceclofenac).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, active peptic ulcer, severe hepatic/renal impairment, pregnancy (third trimester), severe heart failure.
