## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the relief of pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal and joint disorders, such as:

*   Osteoarthritis
*   Rheumatoid arthritis
*   Ankylosing spondylitis
*   Muscle pain, spasms, and stiffness
*   Low back pain
*   Neck pain
*   Musculoskeletal injuries (sprains and strains)
*   Myofascial pain syndrome
*   Fibromyalgia

**Pharmacological Classification:**

*   Aceclofenac: Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID)
*   Eperisone: Centrally-acting Muscle Relaxant
*   Paracetamol: Analgesic and Antipyretic

**Mechanism of Action:** Aceclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, thus decreasing pain and inflammation. Paracetamol acts centrally on the hypothalamus to reduce fever and peripherally to block pain impulse generation.  Eperisone acts on the central nervous system (spinal cord and brain) to relax skeletal muscles, reduce muscle tone, and suppress overactive muscle reflexes that cause spasms and stiffness. It also improves blood flow to the muscles.


## **Alternate Names**

*   Acemyoset P
*   Eperowell AP

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Aceclofenac reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting COX enzymes and prostaglandin synthesis. Paracetamol reduces fever by acting on the hypothalamus and provides analgesia through central and peripheral mechanisms. Eperisone induces muscle relaxation by acting on the central nervous system.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  The individual components are absorbed orally.  Metabolism and elimination pathways involve both hepatic and renal routes.  Specific pharmacokinetic data for the combination product are limited.

**Mode of Action:** Aceclofenac inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. Paracetamol's mechanism is not fully understood but likely involves serotonin pathways and possibly prostaglandin inhibition or cannabinoid receptor influence. Eperisone's action is primarily on the central nervous system, affecting muscle tone and reflexes.

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Aceclofenac inhibits COX enzymes. Paracetamol may modulate serotonin pathways and influence cannabinoid receptors. Eperisone's precise mechanism is not fully elucidated.

**Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal and hepatic for all three components.


## **Dosage**
