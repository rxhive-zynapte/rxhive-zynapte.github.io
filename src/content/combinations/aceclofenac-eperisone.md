## **Usage**

- Aceclofenac + Eperisone is prescribed for the relief of pain and inflammation associated with muscle spasms in conditions such as low back pain, neck pain, and musculoskeletal injuries like sprains and strains. It can also be used for myofascial pain syndrome and fibromyalgia.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This drug is a combination of a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) and a centrally-acting muscle relaxant.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Aceclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin production, thereby decreasing pain and inflammation. Eperisone acts centrally to reduce muscle stiffness and spasms.

## **Alternate Names**

- While there isn't a universally recognized alternate name for the combination, the individual components have other names. Aceclofenac is sometimes referred to as Aceclofenacum.  Eperisone is also known as Eperisoni Hydrochloridum.
- **Brand Names:** This combination is marketed under various brand names such as Acemyoset-P, Myospas, and Nucoxia P.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Aceclofenac provides analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, leading to decreased prostaglandin synthesis. Eperisone relaxes skeletal muscles through its central action, probably by suppressing reflex pathways in the spinal cord. This dual mechanism effectively reduces pain, inflammation, and muscle spasms.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Both drugs are absorbed orally. Aceclofenac is metabolized in the liver and primarily excreted in urine. Eperisone is also metabolized in the liver and eliminated via both renal and biliary routes.
- **Mode of Action:** Aceclofenac binds to COX enzymes, blocking their activity. Eperisone's exact cellular mechanism is unclear, but it's believed to modulate neuronal activity in the central nervous system.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Aceclofenac is primarily excreted via renal pathways. Eperisone is eliminated by hepatic metabolism and excretion through both urine and bile.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The standard dose is one tablet of Aceclofenac 100mg + Eperisone 75mg twice daily, after meals.

#### **Children:**

- This combination is not recommended for children due to a lack of safety and efficacy data.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** A reduced dose is advisable, along with close monitoring for adverse effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is necessary in moderate to severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution and possible dose adjustments are needed in patients with hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring and dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with cardiovascular disease or gastrointestinal bleeding history.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Aceclofenac + Eperisone is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. It's primarily used for outpatient management of musculoskeletal pain and spasms.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments should be based on renal and hepatic function, age, and concomitant medications.


## **Side Effects**

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Chronic NSAID use may increase cardiovascular and renal risks.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Severe allergic reactions, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute liver or kidney injury.


## **Contraindications**
