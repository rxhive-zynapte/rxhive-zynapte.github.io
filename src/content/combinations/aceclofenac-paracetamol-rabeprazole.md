## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the relief of pain, inflammation, and associated gastric discomfort in conditions like osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other musculoskeletal disorders. It is also prescribed for general pain relief, including headaches, toothaches, and muscle aches, and to alleviate symptoms of gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).  It combines a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID), an analgesic/antipyretic, and a Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI).


## **Alternate Names**

No commonly used alternate names exist for this specific combination, although the individual components have various synonyms (e.g., acetaminophen for paracetamol). Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer, including Rypraz-AP and AFEC-PR.



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Aceclofenac and paracetamol reduce pain and inflammation. Aceclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, decreasing prostaglandin synthesis. Paracetamol's mechanism is not fully understood, but it is believed to primarily inhibit COX enzymes in the central nervous system.  Rabeprazole suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the H+/K+ ATPase proton pump in the stomach lining, thus protecting the stomach from potential damage by the NSAID component, Aceclofenac.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The combination is absorbed orally.  Aceclofenac is metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP2C9. Paracetamol also undergoes hepatic metabolism. Rabeprazole is metabolized in the liver. Elimination occurs mainly through renal and fecal routes.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The usual adult dose is Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg + Rabeprazole 20mg twice daily. Dosing frequency and maximum daily dose may vary based on patient response and should be determined by the physician.  Always administer with food to minimize gastric irritation.


#### **Children:**

This combination is generally not recommended for children below 18 years of age, as safety and efficacy have not been established.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and monitor closely for adverse effects. Dose adjustment may be necessary based on renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Exercise caution and consider dose reduction based on liver function.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Carefully assess and monitor patients with heart failure, bleeding disorders, asthma, and other relevant conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The specific combination is not typically indicated for the listed clinical use cases. The individual components might be used, but this specific fixed dose combination is not suitable.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments should be made based on patient-specific factors, including renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, and genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism. Close monitoring is crucial.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dizziness, headache, indigestion, abdominal pain, and drowsiness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcers, acute liver injury, kidney problems, cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Prolonged use, especially at high doses, may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney problems, and cardiovascular events.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome), blood dyscrasias (abnormalities in blood cell components), angioedema (swelling of the face, tongue, or throat).


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any component, active peptic ulcer, severe hepatic insufficiency, pregnancy (third trimester), breastfeeding, severe heart failure, bleeding disorders, history of asthma, urticaria, or allergic reactions after taking NSAIDs or aspirin.


## **Drug Interactions**

Anticoagulants (warfarin), corticosteroids, other NSAIDs, methotrexate, lithium, digoxin, certain antidepressants (SSRIs), alcohol.  CYP450 interactions are possible with drugs metabolized by this enzyme system.  Interaction with OTC drugs, supplements, food, and lifestyle factors like smoking and grapefruit juice should be evaluated.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Contraindicated in the third trimester of pregnancy and during breastfeeding due to potential risks to the fetus or neonate.  Aceclofenac is categorized as pregnancy category C, indicating potential risk to the fetus.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Aceclofenac and Paracetamol: Inhibition of COX enzymes. Rabeprazole: Inhibition of H+/K+ ATPase.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, gastrointestinal bleeding, liver and kidney issues, cardiovascular events.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, active peptic ulcer, severe hepatic insufficiency, pregnancy (3rd trimester), breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, NSAIDs, methotrexate, SSRIs, alcohol.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in the third trimester and during breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** Adults: Aceclofenac 100mg + Paracetamol 325mg + Rabeprazole 20mg twice daily.  Adjust for special populations.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Liver and kidney function, blood pressure, gastrointestinal symptoms, signs of bleeding.

## **Popular Combinations**

While aceclofenac and paracetamol are often combined, adding rabeprazole to this mix is less common.  Other popular combinations for managing pain and inflammation include aceclofenac with serratiopeptidase or thiocolchicoside. These offer muscle relaxant and anti-inflammatory effects for musculoskeletal issues.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Pre-screening for allergies, metabolic disorders, and organ dysfunction is essential.
* **Specific Populations:** Consult specialists for pregnant/breastfeeding women and adjust dosages for children and the elderly based on guidelines.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Advise patients to avoid alcohol and restrict driving if drowsiness or dizziness occurs.
