## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the management of pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal conditions, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, low back pain, muscle spasms, and other painful inflammatory conditions. It may also provide relief from dental pain, headaches, and post-operative pain.  It belongs to the pharmacological classifications of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics, and muscle relaxants. Aceclofenac and paracetamol provide analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, serratiopeptidase acts as an anti-inflammatory and anti-edemic agent, and tizanidine offers muscle relaxation.

## **Alternate Names**

No internationally recognized alternate names exist for this specific four-drug combination. Brand names can vary regionally; some examples may include "Zerodol SP" or "Acemiz S," though it's important to verify if those brands include all four components.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Aceclofenac:**  Inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, primarily COX-2, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and thereby diminishing pain and inflammation.
* **Paracetamol:** Analgesic and antipyretic effects, likely through central mechanisms involving inhibition of COX and modulation of endocannabinoid system.
* **Serratiopeptidase:**  Proteolytic enzyme that breaks down fibrin, reducing inflammation and edema.
* **Tizanidine:** Centrally acting Î±<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist that reduces spasticity and muscle spasms by inhibiting the release of excitatory neurotransmitters in the spinal cord.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* All components are absorbed orally.  
* Primarily metabolized in the liver (hepatic metabolism).
* Eliminated mainly through renal excretion.
