## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for short-term relief of pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal and joint disorders, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, muscle spasms, sprains, strains, low back pain, and other painful musculoskeletal conditions.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This drug is a combination of a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) (Aceclofenac), an analgesic and antipyretic (Paracetamol), and a muscle relaxant (Thiocolchicoside).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Aceclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, which are mediators of pain and inflammation. Paracetamol acts centrally to relieve pain and fever. Thiocolchicoside acts on the central nervous system, reducing muscle stiffness and spasms.

## **Alternate Names**

- There are no widely recognized alternate generic names.
- **Brand Names:** Several brand names exist for this combination drug. A few of these are StayHappi, Genericart, Myfla TH Max 4, MALLicide-AP, Sepiclo PT4, Miofree A, Topnac TH, Swaslife Th forte, Colchifenac, Neorelax MR. These brand names can vary regionally.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Aceclofenac exerts analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, thereby reducing prostaglandin synthesis.  Paracetamol acts on the central nervous system to reduce pain and fever but possesses minimal anti-inflammatory activity. Thiocolchicoside acts centrally to relieve muscle spasms. The combination reduces pain, inflammation and muscle spasm.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Aceclofenac is well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, and excreted primarily through the kidneys. Paracetamol is also rapidly absorbed and metabolized in the liver, with excretion primarily via the kidneys. Thiocolchicoside displays good absorption when administered orally or intramuscularly.
- **Mode of Action:** Aceclofenac and Paracetamol act by inhibiting COX enzymes, thus decreasing prostaglandin production which is key for inflammation and pain transmission. Thiocolchicoside's precise mechanism is unclear, but it acts on GABA and glycine receptors in the central nervous system, leading to muscle relaxation.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Aceclofenac is primarily eliminated via renal excretion. Paracetamol undergoes hepatic metabolism and is eliminated primarily by the kidneys. Thiocolchicoside's elimination pathway is not completely understood.
