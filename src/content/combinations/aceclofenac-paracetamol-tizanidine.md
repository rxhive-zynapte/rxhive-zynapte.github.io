## **Usage**

Aceclofenac + Paracetamol + Tizanidine is prescribed for the relief of pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal conditions, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, low back pain, muscle spasms, and spasticity. It can also be used to alleviate dental pain, menstrual cramps, and headaches.  This combination medication falls under the pharmacological classifications of Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), analgesic, and skeletal muscle relaxant.

Aceclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2), reducing prostaglandin production, which are responsible for inflammation and pain. Paracetamol is thought to inhibit COX enzymes in the central nervous system, further contributing to pain and fever reduction. Tizanidine, an α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist, acts centrally to reduce muscle tone and spasms by inhibiting the release of excitatory neurotransmitters in the spinal cord.

## **Alternate Names**

While there are no officially recognized alternate names for this specific three-drug combination, the individual components may be known by other names (e.g., paracetamol is also known as acetaminophen). Brand names for combinations containing these three drugs include Accetiz P, Movon-MR, Alcinac MR, Ntdol MR, Anprox-MR Tablet, Kinectine MR, Valdone MR, Leemoflam-MR, Acimol-MRX, and Acelase TZ. These brand names may vary depending on the region and manufacturer.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Aceclofenac, as an NSAID, primarily reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, thus decreasing prostaglandin synthesis. Paracetamol offers additional analgesic and antipyretic effects through central COX inhibition. Tizanidine centrally mediates muscle relaxation by binding to α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors in the spinal cord, inhibiting the release of excitatory amino acids like glutamate and aspartate. This reduces neuronal excitability and muscle tone, relieving muscle spasms and spasticity.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Aceclofenac is well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, and primarily excreted through the kidneys. Paracetamol is also rapidly absorbed and metabolized in the liver, with most being excreted in the urine as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. Tizanidine is readily absorbed, with a peak plasma concentration reached in about one hour. It undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, primarily by CYP1A2, and is mainly excreted renally.


## **Dosage**

Dosage information for the combination of Aceclofenac, Paracetamol, and Tizanidine is limited, and individualized treatment is crucial. Consulting a physician is necessary for specific dosage recommendations.



### **Standard Dosage**

#### Adults:
A common dosage form combines 100mg Aceclofenac, 325mg or 500mg Paracetamol, and 2mg Tizanidine. This combination is usually taken twice daily, but the exact dosage and frequency should be determined and adjusted by a physician based on the individual patient's needs and response.  


#### Children:
The safety and efficacy of this combination in children have not been established. Its use is generally not recommended in pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**
* **Elderly Patients:** Close monitoring and potential dosage adjustments are advised due to age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage reduction may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustments are needed for impaired metabolism.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution and individualized dosing are required in patients with comorbidities like hypertension, heart disease, or diabetes.


### **Clinical Use Cases and Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage recommendations for clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not readily available for this combination. Dose modifications based on renal/hepatic function, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms should be made with caution and under the guidance of a healthcare professional.




## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea/constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, loss of appetite, heartburn, indigestion, abdominal pain.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Allergic reactions (e.g., skin rash, itching, facial swelling, difficulty breathing), liver damage (especially with paracetamol overuse), gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration, heart problems.

### **Long-Term Effects:**
Potential long-term complications from prolonged NSAID use include renal dysfunction, cardiovascular issues, and gastrointestinal problems.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
Severe allergic reactions, hepatotoxicity, gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiovascular events.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any of the components, active peptic ulcer, severe heart failure, severe hepatic or renal impairment, recent bypass surgery, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, pregnancy, breastfeeding.

## **Drug Interactions**

This combination can interact with other NSAIDs, anticoagulants, antihypertensives, certain antidepressants, alcohol, and other drugs metabolized by CYP1A2 (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin).  Consult a healthcare professional for specific interactions and potential dosage adjustments.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

This combination is generally contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential risks to the fetus or neonate. Safer alternative analgesics should be considered.
