      **A:** Aceclofenac inhibits COX enzymes, reducing prostaglandin
      production. Pregabalin binds to voltage-gated calcium channels, decreasing
      neurotransmitter release.

## **Usage**

Aceclofenac + Pregabalin is prescribed for the management of neuropathic pain (nerve pain due to damage or dysfunction of the nervous system), as well as chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.  It can also provide short-term relief for acute pain where both anti-inflammatory and neuropathic pain relief are required.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Aceclofenac: Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID)
* Pregabalin: Anticonvulsant, analgesic, and GABA analogue

**Mechanism of Action:** Aceclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin production and thus decreasing pain and inflammation. Pregabalin binds to calcium channels on nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, reducing the release of neurotransmitters involved in pain signaling, thereby decreasing nerve pain.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate generic names. Brand names include Pregabrial ACP, Acenac N, Zerodol PG.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Aceclofenac exerts its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting COX enzymes, leading to a reduction in prostaglandin synthesis. Pregabalin binds to the alpha2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, reducing calcium influx into nerve terminals and decreasing the release of several neurotransmitters, including glutamate, noradrenaline, and substance P.  This leads to a decrease in neuronal excitability and pain signal transmission.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Aceclofenac:** Well absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP2C9, excreted in urine and feces.
* **Pregabalin:**  Rapidly absorbed orally, with peak plasma concentrations reached within one hour.  It is not extensively metabolized and is primarily eliminated through renal excretion.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Aceclofenac inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. Pregabalin binds to the alpha2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels.

**Elimination Pathways:** Aceclofenac is primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism followed by renal and fecal excretion. Pregabalin is primarily eliminated unchanged through renal excretion.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  The typical starting dose is one tablet containing 200 mg of aceclofenac and 150 mg of pregabalin once or twice daily, after meals.  The dosage may be adjusted based on the patient's response and tolerance.

#### **Children:** The safety and efficacy of this combination have not been established in children under 12 years of age. Limited data suggests that for children aged 1 month and older, pregabalin dosing can be initiated based on weight and titrated according to clinical response and tolerability, but caution and close monitoring are necessary.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** The lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration due to the increased risk of adverse effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are necessary for moderate to severe renal impairment. In severe cases, the combination may be contraindicated.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments are required for moderate to severe hepatic impairment. Contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, gastrointestinal disorders, or substance abuse.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific clinical settings (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, emergency situations) should be individualized based on the patient's condition, pain level, and other clinical factors. No standard guidelines exist for these situations with this specific combination.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on patient response, renal function, hepatic function, and other patient-specific factors.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, dizziness, drowsiness, blurred vision, dry mouth, peripheral edema, weight gain, muscle pain, fatigue, headache, uncoordinated body movements.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:** Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema), gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiovascular events (heart failure, myocardial infarction), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, meningitis, difficulty breathing.

### **Long-Term Effects:** Potential long-term effects include gastrointestinal issues, cardiovascular complications, and renal impairment.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Clinically significant ADRs include anaphylaxis, angioedema, gastrointestinal bleeding, and cardiovascular events. These require immediate medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to aceclofenac or pregabalin.
* History of asthma or allergic reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.
* Active gastric/duodenal ulcers or bleeding.
* Severe hepatic impairment.
* Severe renal impairment.
* Severe heart failure.


## **Drug Interactions**

Aceclofenac + Pregabalin may interact with NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen), anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antihypertensives, diuretics (e.g., furosemide), oral hypoglycemic agents, and certain other medications.  It may also interact with alcohol, increasing dizziness and drowsiness.  Consult a comprehensive drug interaction database for a full list of potential interactions.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of Aceclofenac + Pregabalin during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established. It should be used only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. Aceclofenac is not recommended during pregnancy, especially during the third trimester.  Limited data suggests that pregabalin amounts in breast milk are low, but caution is advised when nursing a newborn or preterm infant.  It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before using this combination during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Aceclofenac inhibits COX enzymes, reducing inflammation and pain. Pregabalin modulates neurotransmitter release in the central nervous system, reducing nerve pain.

## **Popular Combinations**

While Aceclofenac + Pregabalin is itself a combination, it may be used in conjunction with other medications for managing specific conditions, such as additional analgesics or medications for underlying diseases.  Any combined use requires careful consideration of potential drug interactions and side effects.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Pre-screening for allergies, renal/hepatic dysfunction, cardiovascular disease is crucial.
* **Specific Populations:** Monitor closely in pregnant/breastfeeding women, children, and the elderly.
