## **Usage**

Aceclofenac + Rabeprazole is prescribed for the relief of pain and inflammation in musculoskeletal disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, particularly in patients with a history of or at risk for NSAID-induced gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity.  It is also used to manage other painful conditions, including toothache, lower back pain, ear and throat pain and post-operative pain.

It is a combination drug belonging to the pharmacological classifications of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) and Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs).

The mechanism of action involves Aceclofenac inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin production, which in turn decreases pain and inflammation. Rabeprazole inhibits the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system in gastric parietal cells, suppressing gastric acid secretion and mitigating the GI risks associated with NSAIDs.


## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for the combination product itself. However, it is marketed under various brand names like:

* Acemiz Rab
* Altraday
* Critcid-A
* Dolostat+R
* MicoRab-R
* Noblinac R
* Rabistrum ACF
* Rodeo-A
* StayHappi Aceclofenac+Rabeprazole


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Aceclofenac, an NSAID, exerts its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.  This leads to a decrease in prostaglandin synthesis, mediators of pain and inflammation. Rabeprazole, a PPI, irreversibly binds to the H+/K+-ATPase pump in gastric parietal cells, reducing gastric acid secretion.  This protects the gastric mucosa from NSAID-induced damage.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Aceclofenac is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentration in 1-3 hours. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily through the kidneys.  Rabeprazole is also absorbed orally but is acid-labile. The enteric coating protects it from gastric acid degradation.  It is metabolized by CYP450 enzymes, primarily CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, in the liver. Excretion occurs mainly through renal and biliary routes.

**Mode of Action:** Aceclofenac exerts its effects through non-selective COX inhibition. Rabeprazole blocks the final step of gastric acid production by inhibiting the proton pump, thereby reducing acid secretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The usual dose is one capsule or tablet containing 200mg Aceclofenac and 20mg Rabeprazole, administered once daily, preferably with food.

#### **Children:** Use is not recommended for children under 18 years old as safety and efficacy have not been established. 

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Caution should be exercised due to increased risk of adverse reactions, especially GI bleeding. Dose reduction may be necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be required for patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction is recommended. Severe hepatic impairment is a contraindication.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration is needed for patients with cardiovascular disease, asthma, or a history of peptic ulcers.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of Aceclofenac + Rabeprazole in specific medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations should be determined on a case-by-case basis with careful risk-benefit assessment. Dosages in these settings are not standardized and should be guided by clinical judgment and patient response.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on patient-specific factors like renal/hepatic dysfunction and comorbidities. Close monitoring for efficacy and adverse effects is crucial, especially in high-risk patients.
