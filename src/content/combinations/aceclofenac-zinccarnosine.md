## **Usage**

- Aceclofenac + Zinc Carnosine is prescribed for the relief of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.  Zinc Carnosine is specifically indicated for gastric ulcers, offering a gastroprotective effect. It can also be used for nutritional deficiencies, particularly zinc deficiency.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Aceclofenac is a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID), and Zinc Carnosine is a mucosal protective agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Aceclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, thereby decreasing pain and inflammation. Zinc carnosine stabilizes and protects the gastric mucosa, mitigating potential gastrointestinal side effects associated with NSAID use.

## **Alternate Names**

- Aceclofenac Zinc Carnosine
- Polaprezinc (for Zinc Carnosine)
- Brand Name: Zacy Safe (and possibly others)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Aceclofenac inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and mitigating inflammation and pain. Zinc carnosine has a local gastroprotective effect on the gastric mucosa, helping prevent NSAID-induced ulcers.  It promotes healing and may have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Aceclofenac is well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, and primarily excreted in the urine. Zinc carnosine has low systemic absorption, acting locally in the gastrointestinal tract.
- **Mode of Action:** Aceclofenac's action on COX enzymes reduces prostaglandin production, which are key mediators of inflammation and pain. Zinc carnosine binds to the gastric mucosa forming a protective barrier and possibly promoting ulcer healing.
- **Elimination:** Aceclofenac is primarily excreted through the kidneys. The elimination pathway of Zinc Carnosine isn't extensively characterized but may involve excretion through feces.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Aceclofenac: 100 mg twice daily.
Zinc Carnosine: 75 mg twice daily or 150mg once daily. This delivers approximately 34 mg of elemental zinc.

#### **Children:**

Aceclofenac + Zinc Carnosine is generally not recommended for children due to a lack of safety and efficacy data. For Zinc Carnosine alone, safety and efficacy haven't been established for children under 12. Its use requires direct medical supervision.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**
Aceclofenac: Initiate therapy with the lowest effective dose. Monitor for adverse events, especially gastrointestinal bleeding and renal impairment.
Zinc Carnosine: A reduced dose of 100 mg/day (approximately 23 mg elemental zinc) is recommended.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
Aceclofenac: Exercise caution. Dose reduction may be required.
Zinc Carnosine: Limited data available, exercise caution.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
Aceclofenac: Initiate at the lowest recommended dose. Monitor liver function tests. Dose adjustment may be required.
Zinc Carnosine: Patients should be under medical supervision.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider risk factors for cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal complications, and drug interactions.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.  These settings generally necessitate specialized analgesics and anesthetic agents.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments should be patient-specific, considering factors like age, renal/hepatic function, and comorbidities. Close monitoring of renal and liver function, along with gastrointestinal symptoms, is recommended.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Diarrhea
- Nausea

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term use of NSAIDs like Aceclofenac can potentially increase the risk of cardiovascular events and gastrointestinal issues such as ulcers and bleeding.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe gastrointestinal symptoms (severe abdominal pain, bloody or black stools, persistent vomiting), signs of liver injury (jaundice, dark urine, right upper quadrant pain), or changes in renal function necessitate immediate intervention.

- Corticosteroids: Increased risk of gastrointestinal ulceration.
- Diuretics: Reduced diuretic effect.
- Lithium: Increased lithium levels.
- Methotrexate: Increased methotrexate toxicity.
- Other NSAIDs: Increased risk of adverse effects.
- Alcohol: Use with caution; interactions are unknown.
- Some antibiotics (quinolones, tetracyclines): Reduced antibiotic absorption.
- Blood pressure medications (ACE inhibitors): May decrease zinc levels.
