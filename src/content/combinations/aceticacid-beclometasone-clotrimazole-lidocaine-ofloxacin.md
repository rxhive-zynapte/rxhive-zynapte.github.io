## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the treatment of otitis externa (outer ear infections) and otitis media (middle ear infections) where bacterial and fungal infections are present.  It is particularly effective in cases where inflammation and pain are significant symptoms.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing medications from different classes:
    - Acetic acid: antiseptic
    - Beclometasone: corticosteroid, anti-inflammatory
    - Clotrimazole: antifungal
    - Lidocaine: local anesthetic
    - Ofloxacin: fluoroquinolone antibiotic

- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination targets various aspects of ear infections:
    - **Ofloxacin:** Inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase, preventing bacterial DNA replication and transcription.
    - **Clotrimazole:** Alters fungal cell membrane permeability, leading to fungal cell death.
    - **Beclometasone:** Reduces inflammation by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.
    - **Lidocaine:** Provides local pain relief by blocking nerve signal transmission.
    - **Acetic Acid:** Creates an acidic environment that is hostile to many pathogens.


## **Alternate Names**

While there isn't one official international non-proprietary name for this specific five-drug combination, each component has its own established name.  Some regional variations may exist for Lidocaine (Lignocaine).

- **Brand Names:** Mixbiotic-AC, Amcure-O, and Oflokan are among the brand names used for this combination. 



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**
    - **Ofloxacin:** Bactericidal action against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
    - **Clotrimazole:** Fungicidal against various fungi, including *Candida* and *Trichophyton*.
    - **Beclometasone:** Suppresses inflammation, reduces itching and swelling.
    - **Lidocaine:** Decreases pain sensation.
    - **Acetic Acid:**  Antiseptic, helps maintain an acidic environment.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily topical administration via ear drops.  Systemic absorption is minimal. The combination is not intended for oral or intravenous use.
    - **Ofloxacin:**  While minimally absorbed systemically after otic administration, when administered orally, it is well-absorbed and metabolized in the liver, excreted primarily through the kidneys.
    - **Beclometasone:** Minimally absorbed through skin/ear canal. After systemic administration, metabolized by the liver and excreted in urine and feces.
    - **Clotrimazole:** Negligible systemic absorption with topical otic use. Following oral administration, it is metabolized in the liver.
    - **Lidocaine:** After topical application, minimal systemic absorption. When administered systemically, it is metabolized in the liver.
    - **Acetic Acid:** Metabolized to carbon dioxide and water.

- **Mode of Action:** See "Mechanism of Action" in the Usage section above for details on each component's cellular/molecular action.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  The typical dose is 2-5 drops instilled into the affected ear 3-4 times daily for 7-14 days. The exact dosage and duration will depend on the severity of the infection.


#### **Children:** This combination is generally not recommended for very young children, especially those under two years of age, because of the potential side effects associated with some components. For children older than two, the dose may be adjusted based on age and weight; consult specialized pediatric resources.
