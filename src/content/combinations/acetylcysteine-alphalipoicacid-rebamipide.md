## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for age-related hearing loss (presbycusis). It is also used in the treatment of gastritis, gastric ulcers, peptic ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and other gastrointestinal conditions.  It has shown efficacy in alleviating symptoms of dry eyes and mouth ulcers.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antioxidant, Mucolytic agent, Mucoprotective agent, Cytoprotective agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination leverages the antioxidant, mucoprotective, and cytoprotective properties of its individual components.  Acetylcysteine and Alpha Lipoic Acid act as antioxidants, scavenging free radicals and protecting cells from oxidative damage. Rebamipide enhances mucus production in the gastrointestinal tract, protecting the mucosa and promoting ulcer healing.

## **Alternate Names**

- Rebagen Otic
- Rebagen-Otic

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Acetylcysteine replenishes glutathione, a vital cellular antioxidant. Alpha Lipoic Acid directly neutralizes free radicals and regenerates other antioxidants like vitamin C and vitamin E. Rebamipide increases prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> in the gastric mucosa, enhances mucus production and mucosal blood flow, reduces inflammation, and stimulates mucosal cell growth.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  
    - **Acetylcysteine:**  Rapidly absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver. Excreted primarily in the urine.
    - **Alpha Lipoic Acid:**  Well-absorbed after oral administration.  Metabolized through various pathways, including oxidation and conjugation. Excreted through the kidneys.
    - **Rebamipide:**  Peak plasma concentration reached in approximately 2 hours.  Minimally metabolized in the liver. Primarily excreted in urine (about 10% as unchanged drug).
- **Mode of Action:** Acetylcysteine acts as a free radical scavenger. Alpha Lipoic Acid acts as an antioxidant by neutralizing free radicals. Rebamipide increases prostaglandin E2 in the gastric mucosa and elevates gastric mucous, gastric mucosal blood flow and secretion of gastric alkaline. Additionally, it stimulates gastric mucosal cell growth and decreases gastric mucosa injury.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**  Rebamipide inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines.
