## **Usage**

Acetylcysteine + Ambroxol is prescribed for respiratory conditions characterized by thick and viscous mucus secretions.  It is indicated for acute and chronic bronchopulmonary diseases such as:

* Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
* Acute and chronic bronchitis
* Bronchiectasis
* Pneumonia
* Asthma (with difficulty in expectoration)
* Cystic fibrosis
* Tracheobronchitis

**Pharmacological Classification:** Mucolytic and expectorant.

**Mechanism of Action:** Acetylcysteine works by breaking down disulfide bonds in mucus, reducing its viscosity.  Ambroxol increases serous secretions in the respiratory tract, promoting mucociliary clearance. It may also exhibit some anti-inflammatory effects.


## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for the combination product itself.  However, the individual components have other names:

* **Acetylcysteine:** N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), NALC
* **Ambroxol:** Ambroxol hydrochloride

**Brand Names:**  Pulmobreathe, PulmoBRIZ (and possibly others, which can vary regionally).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Acetylcysteine exerts its mucolytic action by directly breaking down mucus polymers. Ambroxol, an active metabolite of bromhexine, works by:

* **Stimulating surfactant production:**  Reduces surface tension of mucus, making it less viscous.
* **Increasing ciliary activity:** Facilitates mucus transport out of the airways.
* **Modulating inflammatory response:**  May reduce airway inflammation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Both drugs are absorbed well orally.
* **Metabolism:** Acetylcysteine is metabolized in the liver. Ambroxol is metabolized primarily in the liver, forming dibromoanthranilic acid and glucuronide conjugates.
* **Elimination:**  Acetylcysteine is primarily eliminated renally. Ambroxol is excreted mainly in the urine.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

A common dosage for a combined product containing 300mg Acetylcysteine and 30mg Ambroxol is one tablet twice daily. Other available formulations may include effervescent tablets, syrups, and solutions, each with specific dosing instructions. Always follow the prescribing physician's instructions.

#### **Children:**

Acetylcysteine + Ambroxol is not generally recommended for children under 2 years of age without explicit direction from a physician. Dosing in children varies by age and the specific formulation (syrup, solution). Expert consultation is essential. Dosages for children should be calculated according to weight or age, with adjustments as needed.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are likely necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustments are likely necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with peptic ulcers, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and gastrointestinal disorders.  Consult a physician for personalized recommendations.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific clinical situations such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations requires consultation with a pulmonologist or critical care specialist.  Dosing is tailored to the individual patient's condition and the clinical context. Nebulized acetylcysteine can be used in these settings (refer to dosage information for nebulized acetylcysteine).



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on renal and hepatic function, age, and any comorbid conditions.


## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Stomach upset
* Diarrhea
* Heartburn
* Hypersensitivity
* Headache
* Dizziness



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
* Angioedema
* Anaphylactic shock
* Bronchospasm



### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term use generally does not produce significant side effects.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Any signs of hypersensitivity, severe skin reactions, or gastrointestinal bleeding require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to acetylcysteine or ambroxol.
* Active peptic ulcer.
* Severe hepatic or renal impairment.
* First trimester of pregnancy.
* Breastfeeding (without doctor's advice).


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Antitussives:** May counteract the effects of the expectorant.
* **Antibiotics:** Certain antibiotics (tetracyclines, amphotericin B, ampicillin) may interact.
* **Activated Charcoal:**  May reduce absorption of acetylcysteine.
* **Nitroglycerin:** Acetylcysteine may potentiate vasodilation.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category:  Consult a healthcare professional. Acetylcysteine crosses the placenta; ambroxol can be excreted in breast milk. The combination should be used only if potential benefit outweighs risk. 



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Mucolytic and expectorant; breaks down mucus and facilitates clearance.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach upset, hypersensitivity reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, active peptic ulcer, severe hepatic or renal impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Antitussives, certain antibiotics, activated charcoal.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
* **Dosage:** Varies according to age, condition, and formulation. Consult guidelines.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Respiratory function, oxygen saturation, mucus characteristics.


## **Popular Combinations**

Acetylcysteine + Ambroxol is itself a combination. It may be prescribed along with bronchodilators or inhaled corticosteroids in COPD management.


## **Precautions**

Assess for allergies, pre-existing gastrointestinal, hepatic, and renal conditions.  Monitor respiratory status and mucus characteristics during treatment. Caution advised for elderly patients, pregnant/breastfeeding women, and patients with comorbidities.
