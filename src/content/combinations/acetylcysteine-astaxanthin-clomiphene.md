## **Usage**

This drug combination is primarily prescribed for **female infertility**, particularly in cases of **ovulatory dysfunction**, such as **polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)**.  It is also used to manage infertility due to conditions like **amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome** and **psychogenic amenorrhea**.  It is an **ovarian stimulant** with antioxidant properties.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination does not have a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN).  It is marketed under brand names like **Gencure-Fem**, **Ovaa Shield**, and **Ovaa Shield DS**.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Clomiphene:** A selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), it primarily acts on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland.  By partially blocking estrogen receptors, clomiphene disrupts the normal negative feedback loop, leading to increased secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH).  Elevated FSH and LH levels stimulate follicular development and maturation in the ovaries, ultimately triggering ovulation.
* **Acetylcysteine:** A mucolytic agent, it thins the cervical mucus, improving sperm penetration and motility. Additionally, it may positively impact endometrial thickness, further supporting implantation.
* **Astaxanthin:** A potent antioxidant, it protects developing oocytes from oxidative stress and damage, improving egg quality and potentially enhancing fertility.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

The pharmacokinetics of the combined formulation are not fully understood.  Individual components are absorbed orally.  Clomiphene is metabolized in the liver and primarily excreted in feces. Acetylcysteine is readily absorbed and extensively metabolized. Astaxanthin is lipophilic and accumulates in various tissues.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

A common regimen is clomiphene 50-100mg daily for 5 days, starting on day 3-5 of the menstrual cycle, combined with acetylcysteine 600-1200mg daily (divided into 2-3 doses) and astaxanthin 4mg daily.  Dosage may vary based on individual response and clinical indication.

#### **Children:**

This combination is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution, as the effects on this population are not well studied.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be necessary.  Consult current clinical guidelines.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in patients with liver disease.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with conditions like hypertriglyceridemia, thyroid disorders, adrenal gland issues, endometriosis, and a history of blood clots.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU.  Its use is primarily focused on managing ovulatory dysfunction in female infertility.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be necessary based on individual response and tolerability.  Close monitoring of follicular development and hormone levels is crucial.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, stomach ache, bloating, hot flashes, blurred vision, headache, mood swings.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), visual disturbances, allergic reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential increased risk of ovarian cancer with prolonged use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

OHSS requires immediate medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

Pregnancy, breastfeeding, liver disease, abnormal uterine bleeding of unknown cause, ovarian cysts (unless related to PCOS), hormone-dependent cancers, hypersensitivity to any component.

## **Drug Interactions**

Hormonal medications, anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, heparin), some antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), nitroglycerin, activated charcoal, cough suppressants (e.g., promethazine), gonadorelin, bexarotene, ospemifene, aspirin.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Contraindicated in both pregnancy and breastfeeding. Clomiphene has potential teratogenic effects.  The effects of acetylcysteine and astaxanthin in these conditions aren't fully studied.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Clomiphene stimulates ovulation; acetylcysteine improves cervical mucus and potentially endometrial thickness; astaxanthin acts as an antioxidant, improving egg quality.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, hot flashes, headache, blurred vision, OHSS (rare).
* **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, liver disease, abnormal uterine bleeding, hypersensitivity to components.
* **Drug Interactions:** Hormonal medications, anticoagulants, some antibiotics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
* **Dosage:**  As per clinical guidelines and individualized.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Follicular development, endometrial thickness, hormone levels (E2, progesterone), and signs of OHSS.


## **Popular Combinations**

This specific combination is itself popular for female infertility, especially in PCOS.  It may also be combined with metformin.

## **Precautions**

Careful patient evaluation is essential before starting therapy.  Monitor for side effects, particularly OHSS.  Patients with visual disturbances should avoid driving.
