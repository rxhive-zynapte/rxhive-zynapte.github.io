## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for **female infertility**, particularly in women experiencing **anovulation (failure to release eggs)** or **ovulatory dysfunction**. It is used in cases of infertility related to **polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)** and unexplained infertility where ovulation is irregular or absent.

**Pharmacological Classifications:**

* **Clomiphene:** Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM)
* **Acetylcysteine:** Mucolytic
* **Coenzyme Q10:** Antioxidant

**Mechanism of Action:**

* **Clomiphene:** Stimulates the release of gonadotropins (FSH and LH) by binding to estrogen receptors in the brain, mimicking a low estrogen state. This hormonal cascade promotes follicle development in the ovaries, leading to ovulation.
* **Acetylcysteine:**  Thins the cervical mucus, counteracting the thickening effect of clomiphene, which can hinder sperm penetration.
* **Coenzyme Q10 (Ubiquinone):** A potent antioxidant, protecting cells from free radical damage and supporting mitochondrial function, potentially improving egg quality and overall ovarian health.

## **Alternate Names**

This specific combination doesn't have a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN).  It is often referred to by the names of its individual components.  Some brand names include:

* Clomeva NC 50mg Tablet
* Smartova 50 Combipack
* Smartova 100 Combipack
* E Ova Plus 50mg Tablet
* E Ova Plus 5075600 Mg Tablet


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Clomiphene:**  Induces ovulation by increasing gonadotropin secretion, thereby stimulating ovarian follicular development and maturation.
* **Acetylcysteine:** Reduces mucus viscosity by disrupting disulfide bonds in mucoproteins.
* **Coenzyme Q10:** Enhances mitochondrial energy production and acts as a free radical scavenger.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

Specific pharmacokinetic data for the combination are limited. Information is generally available for individual components.  Clomiphene is readily absorbed orally and extensively metabolized in the liver.  Acetylcysteine is also well-absorbed orally and metabolized in the liver. Coenzyme Q10 absorption can vary and is improved with food.


**Mode of Action:**

* **Clomiphene:** Binds to estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary, modulating feedback mechanisms and increasing gonadotropin release.
* **Acetylcysteine:** Exerts its mucolytic action through breaking down disulfide bonds in mucus glycoproteins.
* **Coenzyme Q10:** Participates in the electron transport chain in mitochondria, supporting ATP synthesis, and scavenges free radicals, protecting against oxidative stress.


**Elimination Pathways:**

* **Clomiphene:** Primarily excreted in feces, with some renal excretion.
* **Acetylcysteine:** Metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine.
* **Coenzyme Q10:** Primarily eliminated through biliary excretion.


## **Dosage**

Dosage guidelines for the fixed-dose combination are limited.  Dosages are determined by physicians based on individual patient needs and response.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Standard dosage guidelines for this specific combination aren't consistently defined in available literature. Dosages will be determined by the physician based on individual patient needs. Clomiphene is often started at 50 mg daily for 5 days, usually beginning on day 5 of the menstrual cycle.  Coenzyme Q10 is often given as a supplement at doses ranging from 100mg to 300mg per day. Acetylcysteine dosages vary considerably depending on the specific indication.
