## **Usage**

This combination of ingredients is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to address deficiencies and support overall health, particularly in conditions like anemia,  and during pregnancy. It may also be used to support cardiovascular and neurological function, enhance energy production, and improve cognitive performance.  It is classified as a nutritional supplement.

The mechanism of action involves the individual components working synergistically:
* Methylcobalamin (vitamin B12) supports nerve function and red blood cell production.
* Folic acid (vitamin B9) is essential for cell growth and division, especially during pregnancy, and contributes to red blood cell production.
* L-Arginine is an amino acid that acts as a precursor to nitric oxide, promoting vasodilation and cardiovascular health.
* Levo-carnitine facilitates fatty acid transport into mitochondria for energy production.
* Acetylcysteine acts as an antioxidant and mucolytic agent.
* Vitamin D3 aids calcium absorption and bone health.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination does not have a specific international nonproprietary name (INN). It's often referred to by the names of its constituents. Brand names include Remylin AX and others.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Methylcobalamin:**  Essential for DNA synthesis, red blood cell maturation, and nerve function. It acts as a cofactor for methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase.
* **Folic Acid:** Converted to tetrahydrofolic acid, crucial for DNA and RNA synthesis, cell division, and homocysteine metabolism.
* **L-Arginine:** Precursor to nitric oxide, leading to vasodilation and improved blood flow. It also plays a role in protein synthesis and hormone release.
* **Levo-carnitine:**  Facilitates the transport of long-chain fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane for beta-oxidation and energy production. It also removes toxic metabolic byproducts from cells.
* **Acetylcysteine:** Precursor to glutathione, a potent antioxidant. It also acts as a mucolytic agent by breaking disulfide bonds in mucus, reducing its viscosity.
* **Vitamin D3:** Regulates calcium and phosphorus absorption, contributing to bone health, immune function, and cell growth.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

The individual components have different pharmacokinetic profiles.

* Methylcobalamin: Absorbed in the ileum, bound to transcobalamin II for transport. Primarily excreted in bile.
* Folic Acid: Absorbed in the jejunum. Metabolized in the liver. Excreted renally.
* L-Arginine: Absorbed in the small intestine. Metabolized primarily by arginase in the liver.  Excreted renally.
* Levo-carnitine: Absorbed in the small intestine. Excreted renally, both unchanged and as metabolites.
* Acetylcysteine:  Rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Metabolized in the liver. Excreted renally.
* Vitamin D3: Absorbed in the small intestine. Metabolized in the liver and kidneys. Excreted in bile and feces.
