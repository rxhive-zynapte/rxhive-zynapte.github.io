## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as a dietary supplement to manage Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and support female fertility. It helps improve ovulatory function, regulate menstrual cycles, and enhance egg quality.  It may also be used to improve insulin sensitivity, reduce oxidative stress, and promote normal hormone levels and ovarian function. This combination is categorized as a dietary supplement and nutraceutical, not a drug. It does not fall under a specific pharmacological classification like antibiotic or analgesic.

The mechanism of action involves the synergistic effects of its components. Myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol improve insulin sensitivity and hormone balance, while L-methylfolate reduces homocysteine levels. Vitamin D3 improves calcium regulation, and N-acetylcysteine acts as an antioxidant and may also improve insulin function.

## **Alternate Names** 

Myo-inositol + L-methylfolate + Acetylcysteine + Vitamin D3; L-Methyl Folate + Myo-Inositol + N-Acetylcysteine + Vitamin D3; Myo-inositol, D-chiro-inositol, L-Methyl Folate, Vitamin D3, and N-Acetylcysteine. Brand names vary widely depending on the manufacturer and specific formulation (e.g., CONFERT, Gynositol, Myocred, Myofem, Ovalife, CLEARCYST.)

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol act as secondary messengers for insulin, improving insulin signaling and glucose uptake. They can influence hormone balance, particularly in women with PCOS. L-methylfolate, the active form of folic acid, is crucial for DNA synthesis, cell division, and reducing homocysteine levels. Vitamin D3 regulates calcium and phosphorus absorption, contributing to bone health and potentially influencing insulin sensitivity. N-acetylcysteine functions as an antioxidant, scavenging free radicals, and supporting glutathione production, which protects cells from oxidative damage.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Absorption, metabolism, and elimination data are limited for this specific combination. Individual components are generally well-absorbed orally. L-methylfolate is converted to tetrahydrofolic acid. Vitamin D3 is hydroxylated in the liver and kidneys to its active form, calcitriol. N-acetylcysteine is metabolized in the liver. Elimination pathways are primarily renal and hepatic for the components.

**Mode of Action:** Myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol can modulate intracellular calcium levels and influence insulin receptor activity.  L-methylfolate participates in one-carbon metabolism, essential for DNA synthesis and methylation reactions.  Vitamin D3 binds to vitamin D receptors, influencing gene expression related to calcium homeostasis and other metabolic processes. N-acetylcysteine replenishes glutathione levels, enhancing the body's antioxidant defense system. Specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation data are limited for this combination.



## **Dosage**

Dosage information for this combination is limited and varies widely depending on the specific product formulation. 

### **Standard Dosage**  

Due to the varying formulations and lack of standardized clinical trials, a universal standard dosage isn't established. Healthcare professionals should consult product labeling and consider individual patient needs.

#### **Adults:**  
Dosing varies significantly based on the specific formulation and manufacturer's recommendations. Typically, one tablet or sachet is taken daily. Always refer to the product packaging for guidance.

#### **Children:**  
Not generally recommended for children unless specifically prescribed by a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**  

Dosage adjustments may be needed for elderly patients, and those with renal or hepatic impairment. Consult a physician for personalized guidance.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  

This combination is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its primary application is as a dietary supplement for PCOS management.


### **Dosage Adjustments**  

Dose modifications may be necessary based on patient-specific factors like renal or hepatic dysfunction, other medical conditions, or concomitant medications. A physician should be consulted for tailored recommendations.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**  
Nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, tiredness, gastrointestinal upset (gas, bloating, diarrhea).


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**  
Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing).  Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.


### **Long-Term Effects**  
Long-term effects are not well-established. Excessive vitamin D intake over prolonged periods can lead to hypercalcemia and kidney stones.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Clinically significant ADRs are rare. Allergic reactions require immediate intervention.




## **Contraindications**

Known hypersensitivity to any of the components. Severe liver or kidney disease.  Bipolar disorder (due to potential interactions with certain medications). Conditions where Vitamin D or calcium supplementation should be avoided (e.g., hypercalcemia).



## **Drug Interactions**


Limited information is available. Consult a physician about potential interactions, particularly with:
* Anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine)
* Chemotherapy drugs (e.g., methotrexate)
* Heart medications (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil)
* Medications affecting folate metabolism or vitamin D levels.


Grapefruit juice may interact with the combination. It's crucial to inform your doctor about all medications and supplements you are taking.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult a physician before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. While L-methylfolate and vitamin D are important during pregnancy, the safety of this specific combination needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
