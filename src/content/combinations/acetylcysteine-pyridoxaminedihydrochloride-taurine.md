## **Usage**

This combination is primarily prescribed as a nutritional supplement to support kidney health and manage diabetic nephropathy. It also exhibits antioxidant properties and offers cellular health, liver function, and immune system support.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antioxidant, Nephroprotective Agent.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Acetylcysteine and taurine act as antioxidants, scavenging free radicals and reducing oxidative stress, thus mitigating kidney damage. Pyridoxamine dihydrochloride, a form of vitamin B6, helps maintain energy balance. This combined action slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy and improves kidney function.

## **Alternate Names**

- Renosave Forte
- Thiamin R Tablet (combined with other ingredients)
- Renopal
- Nefrosave
- Styletaurine


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Acetylcysteine and taurine exert antioxidant effects by scavenging free radicals and protecting kidney cells from oxidative damage. Pyridoxamine enhances energy balance, supporting overall metabolic function.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Acetylcysteine is readily absorbed orally. Taurine is also well-absorbed and distributed throughout the body. Pyridoxamine converts to pyridoxal phosphate, the active form of vitamin B6. Elimination is primarily renal.

- **Mode of Action:**  The combination works by reducing oxidative stress and improving kidney function.

- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Taurine modulates certain brain receptors and can enhance insulin action.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One tablet containing Acetylcysteine 150mg + Pyridoxamine Dihydrochloride 75mg + Taurine 500mg once or twice daily, after meals. Other dosages of Acetylcysteine (300mg, 600mg, 1200mg) are available and can be adjusted according to medical condition.

#### **Children:**

This combination is not recommended for children under 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage reduction may be required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, and dosage adjustments may be necessary.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Specific dosage recommendations for clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not explicitly defined for this combination.

For instance, for paracetamol poisoning, a loading dose of 140 mg/kg, followed by maintenance doses of 70 mg/kg every 4 hours for a total of 17 doses might be used. For radiocontrast-induced nephropathy, 600-1200 mg/day for 2 days is sometimes recommended.  Acetylcysteine can also be used as a mucolytic, where the dosage is three times a day.
