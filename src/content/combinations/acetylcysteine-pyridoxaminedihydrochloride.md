## **Usage**

- Acetylcysteine + Pyridoxamine dihydrochloride is prescribed for the management of chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly in patients with diabetes and hypertension. It helps to slow the progression of CKD and protect kidney function.  It also finds use as an antidote for paracetamol poisoning.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  This combination acts as a nutritional supplement and a nephroprotective agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Acetylcysteine functions as an antioxidant, scavenging free radicals and protecting kidney tissues from oxidative damage. Pyridoxamine dihydrochloride, a form of vitamin B6, inhibits the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which contribute to the progression of diabetic nephropathy.  It also acts as a coenzyme in fat, carbohydrate, and protein metabolism, thus helping to maintain energy balance in CKD patients.

## **Alternate Names**

- While "Acetylcysteine + Pyridoxamine dihydrochloride" is the generic name, there isn't an internationally recognized alternate name.
- **Brand Names:**  Nefrosave Forte, Renosave Forte, Stylecystin Forte.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Acetylcysteine's antioxidant effect helps to protect kidney cells from damage.  Pyridoxamine dihydrochloride, by inhibiting AGEs formation, reduces inflammation and fibrosis in the kidneys, thereby slowing disease progression. It also assists in nutrient metabolism.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Acetylcysteine is absorbed orally, while pyridoxamine dihydrochloride's absorption varies.
    - **Metabolism:** Acetylcysteine is extensively metabolized in the liver, forming cysteine, its active metabolite, and other metabolites like N,N-diacetylcysteine and N-acetylcysteine. Pyridoxamine is converted to pyridoxal phosphate, the active form of vitamin B6. 
    - **Elimination:** Acetylcysteine metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine.
- **Mode of Action:**  At the cellular level, acetylcysteine increases glutathione levels, which plays a crucial role in cellular defense against oxidative stress. Pyridoxamine inhibits the formation of AGEs by trapping reactive carbonyl intermediates. The combination works synergistically to protect kidney function.


## **Dosage**

Due to the limited information, providing detailed dosage guidelines for different clinical scenarios is not possible. Dosage should be individualized based on patient characteristics and clinical response.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Consult the prescribing information for a particular brand, as there isn't a globally standardized dosage. As per some sources, one tablet containing 300mg of Acetylcysteine and 50-75mg of Pyridoxamine Dihydrochloride once or twice daily. However, it's crucial to consult your healthcare provider.
