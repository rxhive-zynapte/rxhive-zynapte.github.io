## **Usage**

Adapalene + Dapsone is prescribed for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris.  It is classified as an anti-acne agent, combining a retinoid and an antibiotic.  Adapalene works by normalizing the lifecycle of keratinocytes within the hair follicle, preventing microcomedone formation. It reduces inflammation and promotes differentiation of follicular epithelial cells. Dapsone has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Adapalene + Dapsone" is the standard generic name, there may be regional variations.  A popular brand name is Epiduo Forte gel.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Adapalene, a retinoid, binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors and modulates gene expression to normalize follicular keratinization, resulting in reduced microcomedone formation and comedolytic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-seborrheic effects.  Dapsone, a sulfone antibiotic, exhibits antibacterial activity against *Cutibacterium acnes* and also has anti-inflammatory properties, decreasing the number of inflammatory acne lesions.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Adapalene exhibits minimal systemic absorption after topical application, with less than 0.01% absorbed systemically, and plasma clearance within 72 hours. Dapsone applied topically reaches a blood level of approximately 1% of that achieved with a 100 mg oral dose. Elimination pathways for both drugs after topical application are not well-characterized, but limited systemic absorption suggests minimal involvement of renal or hepatic pathways for topical use. 


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a pea-sized amount of Adapalene + Dapsone gel once daily to the entire face and other affected areas.

#### **Children:**

Use in children under 12 years old has not been established. For adolescents 12 years and older, follow the adult dosage.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution due to potential increased skin sensitivity.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary as systemic absorption is minimal.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is necessary as systemic absorption is minimal.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, methemoglobinemia, or eczema.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Adapalene + Dapsone is not indicated for use in situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It is exclusively for topical treatment of acne vulgaris.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific dosage adjustments are necessary based on renal/hepatic dysfunction or metabolic disorders as systemic absorption is minimal.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Dryness, erythema, oiliness, peeling, irritation, burning, and pruritus at the application site.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Methemoglobinemia, hemolysis (especially in patients with G6PD deficiency), allergic reactions (skin rash, itching, hives, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), and severe skin reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects**

No specific long-term adverse effects have been identified.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Methemoglobinemia, hemolytic anemia, and severe allergic reactions require immediate medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to adapalene, dapsone, or any component of the formulation. Relative contraindications include eczema, sunburn, and concomitant use of other potentially irritating skincare products.

## **Drug Interactions**

Concomitant use with retinoids (like isotretinoin), photosensitizing agents, and other topical acne medications (like benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid) may increase skin irritation. Applying benzoyl peroxide at the same time as Adapalene + Dapsone may temporarily cause a yellow or orange discoloration of the skin and hair. Using Adapalene + Dapsone with oral dapsone or antimalarial drugs should be avoided due to the potential for hemolytic reactions.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Adapalene is classified as Pregnancy Category C. While topical application leads to minimal systemic absorption, its use during pregnancy should be avoided. The safety of dapsone during pregnancy has not been established, although topical dapsone appears to be safe during the first and second trimesters. It should be discontinued during the last month. Both adapalene and topical dapsone can be excreted in breast milk, therefore the use is not recommended while breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Adapalene normalizes follicular keratinization, reducing microcomedone formation. Dapsone provides antibacterial and anti-inflammatory action.
* **Side Effects:**  Dryness, erythema, pruritus at the application site. Rarely: methemoglobinemia, hemolysis.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to adapalene or dapsone.
* **Drug Interactions:** Other topical acne medications, photosensitizing agents, oral dapsone, antimalarial medications.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Avoid use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** Apply a pea-sized amount once daily to the entire face and other affected areas.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for signs of methemoglobinemia and hemolysis, especially in patients with G6PD deficiency.

## **Popular Combinations**

Adapalene + Dapsone is often used as monotherapy. Combining it with other topical acne treatments, like benzoyl peroxide or clindamycin, can be effective but may increase the risk of skin irritation.

## **Precautions**

Avoid applying Adapalene + Dapsone to broken skin, cuts, open wounds, or sunburned skin. Keep away from eyes, nose, and mouth.  Concomitant use with other potentially irritating skincare products may exacerbate dryness and irritation.  Patients should be advised to use sun protection.
