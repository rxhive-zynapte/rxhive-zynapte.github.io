## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed to manage capillary bleeding and reduce capillary fragility.  It is classified as a hemostatic or antihemorrhagic agent.

## **Alternate Names**

There isn't a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN). It is often identified by its components. Brand names include Styptocid, Cadisper-C, and Styptocip.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Adrenochrome monosemicarbazone:** Promotes vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation, thereby reducing capillary fragility and controlling bleeding.
* **Rutin:** This bioflavonoid strengthens capillary walls and exhibits anti-inflammatory properties.
* **Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid):** Enhances collagen synthesis, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of blood vessels. It may also improve the absorption and effectiveness of the other ingredients.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Specific details on the combined formulation's absorption, metabolism, and elimination are limited. The individual components have varying pharmacokinetic profiles.

**Mechanism of Action:** The combined action contributes to hemostasis by improving capillary resistance, promoting vasoconstriction, and aiding blood clotting.
