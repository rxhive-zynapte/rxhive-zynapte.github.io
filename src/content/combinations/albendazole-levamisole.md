## **Usage**

Albendazole + Levamisole is prescribed for the treatment of various parasitic worm infections, including hookworm, roundworm, tapeworm, pinworm, threadworm, whipworm infections, hydatid disease, and neurocysticercosis.  Its pharmacological classifications are anthelmintic and immunomodulator.

Albendazole inhibits tubulin polymerization in parasites, disrupting their metabolism and leading to immobilization and death. Levamisole, an immunomodulator,  suppresses enzyme activity in the worm's muscles, causing paralysis and death, and also potentially stimulates the host’s immune response against the parasites.

## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination.  However, the individual drugs are known by their generic names: Albendazole and Levamisole.  Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Albendazole disrupts microtubule formation in helminths, leading to impaired glucose uptake, reduced energy production, and ultimately, parasite death. Levamisole causes paralysis of susceptible nematodes through a cholinergic agonist effect, leading to their expulsion from the gastrointestinal tract. It may also have immunostimulatory effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Albendazole is poorly absorbed orally but its primary metabolite, albendazole sulfoxide, is the active anthelmintic.  Albendazole sulfoxide’s bioavailability increases when co-administered with levamisole.  Albendazole sulfoxide is metabolized in the liver and excreted in bile. Levamisole is well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in urine.

**Mode of Action:** Albendazole binds to β-tubulin, preventing its polymerization into microtubules. Levamisole acts as a cholinergic agonist, causing persistent stimulation of nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction of susceptible nematodes, leading to paralysis. 

**Elimination Pathways:** Albendazole is primarily eliminated via biliary excretion after hepatic metabolism, while Levamisole is predominantly excreted renally.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  A single dose of Albendazole 400 mg + Levamisole (dosage varies, typically 150 mg for adults) is usually recommended for intestinal infections.  For systemic infections like hydatid disease or neurocysticercosis, higher doses and longer treatment durations are necessary.

#### **Children:** Pediatric dosing is weight-based, and usually contraindicated in children under 6 years of age. Dosing information for children can be found in source [9].

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution in elderly patients with hepatic dysfunction.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are not typically required, but careful monitoring is necessary.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary. Close monitoring of liver function is required.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with pre-existing blood disorders, epilepsy, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome or any other conditions affecting the immune system.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of Albendazole + Levamisole in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergencies is not indicated. It is specifically used for the treatment of parasitic worm infections.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications might be needed in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.
