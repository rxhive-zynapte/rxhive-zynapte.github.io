## **Usage**

- Alcaftadine + Ketorolac ophthalmic solution is prescribed for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis.
- **Pharmacological classification:** This combination drug includes an antihistamine (Alcaftadine) and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) (Ketorolac).
- **Mechanism of action:** Alcaftadine works by blocking H1 receptors and stabilizing mast cells, reducing the effects of histamine release. Ketorolac inhibits COX enzymes, reducing prostaglandin production, which leads to decreased inflammation and pain.

## **Alternate Names**

- While the generic name is Alcaftadine + Ketorolac, variations might exist internationally.
- **Brand names:** A common brand name is Alcarex KT. Lastacaft was a brand name for Alcaftadine, and Acular for Ketorolac.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Alcaftadine antagonizes H1 receptors and stabilizes mast cells, mitigating the effects of histamine release, therefore reducing itching, redness, and swelling.  Ketorolac inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, reducing prostaglandin production, which leads to a decrease in inflammation and pain.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Alcaftadine has low systemic absorption after topical ophthalmic administration. Ketorolac, when administered ophthalmically, can reach detectable systemic levels, especially with prolonged use.
- **Receptor binding/enzyme inhibition:** Alcaftadine binds to H1 receptors. Ketorolac inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism and renal excretion for both drugs.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- Instill one drop in each affected eye twice daily.

#### **Children:**
- Safety and efficacy have not been established in children under 2 years old.
- Limited information suggests potential use in children 3 years and older but under strict medical supervision and adapted dosing. 

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution; data limited. Do not exceed 60mg/day of Ketorolac component.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Contraindicated in severe renal impairment. Use with caution in moderate renal impairment, reducing the Ketorolac dose.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution; monitor for liver toxicity. Limited specific guidance for combined formulation exists, primarily for Ketorolac component.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use cautiously in patients with glaucoma, dry eye syndrome, arthritis, diabetes, or bleeding/blood clotting problems.
