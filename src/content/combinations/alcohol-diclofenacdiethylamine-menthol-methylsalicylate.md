## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** This combination is prescribed for the local symptomatic relief of mild to moderate musculoskeletal pain and inflammation. This includes:
    - Muscle pain
    - Sprains
    - Strains
    - Bruises
    - Contusions
    - Osteoarthritis of superficial joints (e.g., knee)
    - Localized soft tissue rheumatism
    - Post-traumatic pain

- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Topical analgesic, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), Counterirritant

- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination medication works through multiple pathways:
    - **Diclofenac diethylamine:** Inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and thereby decreasing pain and inflammation.
    - **Methyl salicylate:** Acts as a counterirritant, creating a warming sensation that distracts from deeper pain. It also has some analgesic properties.
    - **Menthol:** Creates a cooling sensation followed by warmth, diverting pain perception and increasing local blood flow.
    - **Alcohol:** Enhances the penetration of the other active ingredients through the skin.  It acts as a solvent and may also exert some analgesic and antiseptic effects.


## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names for this specific combination exist. However, it is often referred to by brand names.

- **Brand Names:** Various brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region.  (Brand names vary significantly by region and it is important to consult local formularies for accurate information. )


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**
    - Diclofenac:  Inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis.  This leads to decreased pain, inflammation, and fever.
    - Methyl salicylate:  Stimulates TRPV1 receptors, causing a warming sensation and some pain relief.
    - Menthol: Activates TRPM8 receptors, producing a cooling sensation followed by vasodilation and mild analgesia.
    - Alcohol: Enhances skin permeability for other active ingredients.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** When applied topically,  diclofenac is absorbed through the skin, achieving low systemic concentrations. Methyl salicylate and menthol are also absorbed, with a limited degree of systemic distribution. Alcohol facilitates absorption but evaporates quickly.
    - **Metabolism:** Diclofenac is primarily metabolized in the liver. Methyl salicylate is metabolized to salicylic acid. Menthol is metabolized in the liver.
    - **Elimination:** Diclofenac metabolites are excreted primarily in urine and bile. Methyl salicylate metabolites are also eliminated mainly through urine. Menthol metabolites are excreted in urine and bile.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults and children over 14 years:**

- Apply 2-4 g (approximately 4-8 cm of gel when the tube opening is fully exposed) to the affected area 3-4 times daily.
- Gently rub the gel into the skin.
- Wash hands thoroughly after application unless treating the hands.
- The maximum recommended daily dose of diclofenac when combined with other topical formulations should not exceed 32 grams.
- Duration of treatment without consulting a physician should not exceed 7-10 days.

#### **Children (under 14 years):**

- Not recommended for use in children under 14 years unless specifically directed by a physician.

- **Elderly Patients:** Standard dosage is typically applicable, but monitoring for adverse effects is important.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Systemic absorption is minimal, but monitoring is recommended.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution.  Monitoring for adverse effects is essential.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or a history of peptic ulcer disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**
