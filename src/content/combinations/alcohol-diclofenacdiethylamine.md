Combining alcohol with diclofenac diethylamine is generally not recommended due to the increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects. While diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat pain and inflammation, both diclofenac and alcohol can irritate the stomach lining. Taking them together may increase the risk of stomach upset, ulcers, or bleeding. Therefore, it is advisable to avoid or limit alcohol consumption while using diclofenac.

## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Diclofenac diethylamine is prescribed for pain relief and inflammation reduction in conditions like osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other musculoskeletal injuries or pain conditions.  It may also be used to alleviate pain associated with menstrual cramps.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), analgesic (pain reliever), anti-inflammatory.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Diclofenac primarily works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2.  These enzymes are responsible for producing prostaglandins, which contribute to pain and inflammation. By blocking COX enzymes, diclofenac reduces prostaglandin synthesis, thereby alleviating pain and inflammation.

## **Alternate Names**

- **Alternate Names/Variations:**  Diclofenac diethylammonium, Diclofenac.
- **Brand Names:** Voltaren, Cataflam, Cambia, Zipsor. Note: Brand names may vary regionally.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Diclofenac reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting COX enzymes.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - **Absorption:** Well-absorbed orally, with bioavailability around 60% for oral tablets and delayed-release formulations have slower absorption for prolonged effect.
    - **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP2C9.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted mainly through the kidneys (65%) and bile (35%).

- **Mode of Action:**  Inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, preventing prostaglandin production.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal and hepatic.



## **Dosage**

**Standard Dosage**

**Adults:** Oral formulations: Standard dose of 25 mg 2-3 times daily, up to maximum of 150 mg/day for immediate-release tablets. Slow-release (extended-release) tablets are usually 75-100 mg once or twice daily, and should be taken whole and not crushed.  The dosage is adjusted based on patient response and indication.


**Children:** Use and dose must be determined by a doctor. Generally, diclofenac is not recommended for children under 14 years of age except under specific circumstances with careful dose calculations.


**Special Cases:**


- **Elderly Patients**: Lower doses may be necessary due to potential decline in hepatic function and kidney function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Dose adjustment is necessary, usually a reduction in the total daily dose.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Lower doses may be recommended due to reduced metabolic capacity.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on specific conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or gastrointestinal problems.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  Diclofenac is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations for primary management. Other drugs are preferred in these specific settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary based on renal and hepatic impairment, drug interactions, and individual patient response.



## **Side Effects**


**Common Side Effects:**
- Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation).
- Headache, dizziness.
- Fluid retention.


**Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
- Gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers.
- Heart attack, stroke.
- Allergic reactions.
- Liver damage.
- Kidney damage.


**Long-Term Effects:**  Long-term usage is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal issues.



## **Contraindications**


- Hypersensitivity to diclofenac or other NSAIDs.
- History of asthma attacks, urticaria, or acute rhinitis after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.
- Active peptic ulcer.
- Severe heart failure.
- Severe renal impairment.
- Severe hepatic impairment.
- Third trimester of pregnancy.

## **Drug Interactions**


- Anticoagulants (warfarin): Increased bleeding risk.
- Lithium: Increased lithium levels.
- Methotrexate: Increased toxicity risk.
- Other NSAIDs, including aspirin: Increased gastrointestinal side effects.
- Diuretics: Reduced effectiveness of diuretics.
- ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers: May decrease effectiveness.
- Alcohol: Increased risk of GI upset.
- CYP2C9 inhibitors: Increased risk of side effects.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**


- Pregnancy Safety Category: Avoid in the third trimester. Generally, NSAIDs should be used with caution during pregnancy, especially in the first and second trimesters, only if the benefits outweigh the risks.
- Fetal Risks: Premature closure of ductus arteriosus.
- Breastfeeding: Small amounts may be present in breast milk, potential for infant adverse effects, safer alternatives usually preferred.


## **Drug Profile Summary**


- **Mechanism of Action:** COX inhibitor, reduces prostaglandin synthesis.
- **Side Effects:** GI upset, headache, dizziness, cardiovascular risks with long-term use.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, GI bleeding, severe cardiac, renal, hepatic impairment, 3rd-trimester pregnancy.
- **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, lithium, methotrexate, other NSAIDs.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Caution advised, avoid in 3rd trimester.
- **Dosage:** Varies based on age, condition, formulation; up to 150 mg/day for adults.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, renal function, liver function tests, signs of GI bleeding.


## **Popular Combinations**


- It's not usual to prescribe diclofenac diethylamine with other medicines in combination, unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks and a close patient monitoring takes place.


## **Precautions**


- Assess for allergies, renal/hepatic function, and cardiovascular risks.
- Avoid or limit alcohol consumption.
- Monitor for gastrointestinal symptoms.
- Avoid prolonged use.
