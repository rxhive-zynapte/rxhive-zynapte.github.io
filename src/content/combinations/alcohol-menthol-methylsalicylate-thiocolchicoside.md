## **Usage**

This topical combination is prescribed for musculoskeletal pain relief, including muscle spasms, sprains, strains, osteoarthritis, low back pain, and frozen shoulder.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing a Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), a muscle relaxant, counterirritants, and a topical analgesic with anti-inflammatory properties.

**Mechanism of Action:**  This combination works through multiple pathways to reduce pain and inflammation. Diclofenac and methyl salicylate inhibit COX enzymes, decreasing prostaglandin synthesis. Thiocolchicoside activates GABA pathways, inducing muscle relaxation. Menthol acts as a counterirritant and analgesic via TRPM8 receptor activation. Linseed oil provides anti-inflammatory action.

## **Alternate Names**

Thiocolchicoside + Diclofenac + Methyl Salicylate + Menthol + Linseed Oil gel; Thiotuf Gel; ThioQuest Gel; Thiotrop Gel; Diclofenac Diethylamine + Thiocolchicoside + Linseed Oil + Methyl Salicylate + Menthol Gel.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Diclofenac and Methyl Salicylate reduce pain and inflammation by inhibiting COX enzymes and prostaglandin synthesis. Thiocolchicoside promotes muscle relaxation and analgesia by activating GABA inhibitory pathways. Linseed oil contributes to the anti-inflammatory effect, while menthol provides a cooling sensation and topical analgesia by activating TRPM8 receptors.

**Pharmacokinetics:** As a topical medication, systemic absorption is limited.  The components are metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted through the kidneys. The exact metabolic pathways and elimination rates for this specific combination aren't fully characterized in the available literature.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer to the affected area four times daily, or as directed by a physician. Do not exceed 32 grams of diclofenac daily (across all treated areas). For upper body joints, the maximum is 8 grams of diclofenac per joint per day, and for lower body joints, 16 grams per joint per day.

#### **Children:**  Use in children under 12 is generally not recommended due to limited safety and efficacy data. Consult a pediatrician if considering use in this age group.
