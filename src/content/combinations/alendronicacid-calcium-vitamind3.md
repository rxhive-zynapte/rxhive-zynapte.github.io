## **Usage**

Alendronic acid + calcium + vitamin D3 is prescribed for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, particularly in postmenopausal women and in men. It also helps increase bone mass and reduce the risk of fractures, including hip and spine fractures, in individuals at risk.  It is also utilized for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. This combination specifically targets postmenopausal women at risk of vitamin D insufficiency. This medication belongs to the **bisphosphonate** class of drugs, combined with essential minerals.

Alendronic acid inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, while vitamin D3 enhances calcium absorption.  Calcium is vital for bone health. This combined action leads to increased bone mineral density and reduced fracture risk.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Alendronic acid + calcium + vitamin D3" accurately describes the drug's composition, alendronate sodium trihydrate + colecalciferol is a more chemically precise term.  Brand names include Fosavance, Ostomax D, and Alen D, among others.  A combination pack containing separate tablets for alendronate and calcium/vitamin D3 may be marketed under various brand names.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Alendronic acid, a bisphosphonate, binds to hydroxyapatite on bone surfaces, preferentially at sites of active resorption. It inhibits osteoclast activity, reducing bone turnover and thereby increasing bone mass.  Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) gets converted to calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D. Calcitriol enhances intestinal calcium absorption and plays a vital role in bone mineralization. Calcium is a fundamental component of the bone matrix.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Alendronate has low bioavailability and its absorption is reduced by food and other medications. It gets rapidly distributed to bone or excreted in the urine. Vitamin D3 is absorbed from the gut and undergoes hepatic and renal metabolism.  Alendronate is not metabolized and is primarily excreted unchanged in urine. Both vitamin D and calcium are important for maintaining serum calcium homeostasis.  

**Mode of action:** Alendronate directly inhibits osteoclast activity.  Vitamin D indirectly influences bone metabolism by promoting calcium absorption and modulating bone remodeling.  Calcium provides the structural building blocks for bone. No direct receptor binding or enzyme inhibition is associated with calcium.

**Elimination:** Alendronate is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Vitamin D metabolites are eliminated through biliary and renal routes.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard dosage for osteoporosis treatment and prevention is one 70 mg alendronate + 2800 IU (or 5600 IU) vitamin D3 tablet once weekly. The higher vitamin D dose (5600 IU) is generally preferred for patients not taking supplemental vitamin D.  The tablet should be taken on an empty stomach, at least 30 minutes before the first food, drink, or other medication of the day. It must be swallowed whole with plain water, remaining upright for at least 30 minutes after ingestion.

#### **Children:**

Alendronic acid + calcium + vitamin D3 is not recommended for use in children under 18. Safety and efficacy have not been established in this population.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients**: No dosage adjustment is necessary for the elderly.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Dose adjustment may be necessary for patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 ml/min. Not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: No dosage adjustment is generally required.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Patients with esophageal disorders, hypocalcemia, or inability to remain upright should not take this medication. Caution is advised in patients with gastrointestinal issues. Correct existing vitamin D deficiency before starting the medication. Monitor calcium and vitamin D levels in patients taking glucocorticoids.  Patients with certain conditions, such as sarcoidosis, leukemia, and lymphoma should be monitored for hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Alendronic acid + calcium + vitamin D3 is specifically indicated for long-term treatment and prevention of osteoporosis and is not intended for acute medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be needed based on renal function, vitamin D levels, and other patient-specific factors.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Gastrointestinal disturbances (abdominal pain, heartburn, nausea, constipation, diarrhea), musculoskeletal pain, headache.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Esophageal irritation (esophagitis, ulcers, strictures), atypical femoral fractures, osteonecrosis of the jaw, severe hypocalcemia, allergic reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Consult resources for a detailed list of interactions. Aspirin and NSAIDs may increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

## **Popular Combinations**

Often used in conjunction with calcium and vitamin D supplementation when dietary intake is inadequate.
