      How does alfacalcidol differ from regular vitamin D?**


      **A:** Alfacalcidol is activated in the liver, while vitamin D requires
      activation in the kidneys. This makes alfacalcidol suitable for patients
      with kidney disease.

## **Usage**

Alfacalcidol + Calcium is primarily prescribed for conditions characterized by calcium deficiency or impaired calcium metabolism.  These include:

* **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), especially with secondary hyperparathyroidism:**  In CKD, the kidneys' ability to convert vitamin D to its active form is impaired, leading to low calcium levels and bone disease (renal osteodystrophy). Alfacalcidol helps to correct this deficiency.
* **Hypoparathyroidism:**  This condition results in low levels of parathyroid hormone, leading to hypocalcemia. Alfacalcidol helps increase calcium levels.
* **Osteoporosis:** Alfacalcidol can improve bone density and reduce fracture risk in osteoporosis, especially when combined with calcium.
* **Vitamin D-resistant Rickets and Osteomalacia:** These conditions involve softening of the bones due to impaired vitamin D metabolism.  Alfacalcidol can improve calcium absorption and bone mineralization.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Vitamin D analog, calcium regulator.

**Mechanism of Action:** Alfacalcidol is a prohormone converted in the liver to calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3), the active form of vitamin D. Calcitriol binds to vitamin D receptors in the intestine, kidneys, and bone, increasing calcium absorption, reducing calcium excretion, and promoting bone mineralization. It also suppresses parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, which further helps regulate calcium levels.


## **Alternate Names**

* **Alfacalcidol** is the generic name.
* **1α-hydroxyvitamin D3**
* **1α-hydroxycholecalciferol**

**Brand Names:** One-Alpha®, Bondiol®, Alfaget®


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Alfacalcidol's primary effect is to increase serum calcium levels. It achieves this by enhancing calcium absorption from the intestine, decreasing renal calcium excretion, and mobilizing calcium from bone.  It also decreases serum alkaline phosphatase and PTH levels in patients with CKD.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Alfacalcidol is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  Food does not significantly affect absorption.
* **Metabolism:** It is rapidly metabolized in the liver to calcitriol, its active form.
* **Elimination:** Calcitriol is eliminated primarily through the bile and feces, with a small amount excreted in the urine.

**Mode of Action:** Alfacalcidol's active metabolite, calcitriol, binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a nuclear receptor.  This complex then interacts with specific DNA sequences, regulating the expression of genes involved in calcium transport and bone metabolism.

**Receptor Binding:**  Binds to the Vitamin D Receptor (VDR).

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic, biliary excretion, with some renal excretion.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Initial: 0.5–1 mcg daily, adjusted according to serum calcium levels.

Maintenance: 0.25–1 mcg daily.


#### **Children:**

<20 kg: 0.05 mcg/kg/day.

≥20 kg:  Similar to adult dosing, starting at the lower end of the range.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Start with 0.5 mcg daily.  Titrate cautiously.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustment is usually not necessary, as alfacalcidol bypasses the need for renal activation. Close monitoring of calcium levels is essential.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution, as hepatic metabolism is essential for activation.  Monitor calcium levels carefully.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is necessary, especially in patients with conditions that predispose to hypercalcemia.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Alfacalcidol's dosage in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations should be individualized based on the patient's condition, calcium levels, and other relevant factors. There is no standardized dosing protocol for these settings.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments should be based on serum calcium levels and clinical response. Hypercalcemia requires dose reduction or temporary discontinuation.


## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects:**

Hypercalcemia (high calcium levels), nausea, vomiting, constipation, weakness, headache.



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Cardiac arrhythmias, kidney stones, confusion, pancreatitis.



### **Long-Term Effects:**

Nephrocalcinosis (calcium deposits in the kidneys), vascular calcification.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe hypercalcemia requiring hospitalization.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypercalcemia
* Hyperphosphatemia
* Vitamin D toxicity
* Hypersensitivity to alfacalcidol or any components of the formulation


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Thiazide diuretics:** May increase the risk of hypercalcemia.
* **Digoxin:** Hypercalcemia can exacerbate digoxin toxicity.
* **Magnesium-containing antacids:** May increase the risk of hypermagnesemia.
* **Cholestyramine:** May reduce the absorption of alfacalcidol.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Alfacalcidol should be used with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  It is classified as Pregnancy Category C, meaning that animal studies have shown adverse effects on the fetus, but there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans.  Alfacalcidol is excreted in breast milk.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
