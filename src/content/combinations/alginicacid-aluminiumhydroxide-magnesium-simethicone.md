## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the relief of symptoms related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), heartburn, acid indigestion, sour stomach, upset stomach, and gas.  It falls under the pharmacological classifications of antacid, anti-reflux agent, and antiflatulent. The mechanism of action involves neutralizing excess stomach acid, creating a protective barrier against acid reflux, and reducing gas formation in the gastrointestinal tract.

## **Alternate Names**

While a standard international nonproprietary name doesn't exist for this specific combination, the individual components are recognized by their respective generic names. Brand names may vary regionally; some examples include Gaviscon, Maalox, Mylanta, and others depending on the specific formulation and region.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Alginic acid forms a viscous raft that floats on top of the stomach contents, acting as a physical barrier against acid refluxing into the esophagus. Aluminium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide neutralize stomach acid. Simethicone reduces the surface tension of gas bubbles, allowing them to coalesce and be expelled more easily.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Alginic acid is not absorbed systemically. Aluminium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide have limited systemic absorption. Simethicone is not absorbed and is eliminated unchanged in the feces. Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination for absorbed aluminum and magnesium.

**Mode of Action:** This is a combination product with several mechanisms. There's no receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation associated with this combination.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for absorbed aluminum and magnesium. Simethicone is eliminated in feces.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Liquid formulations: 10-20 mL or 2-4 chewable tablets orally, taken four times a day after meals and at bedtime, as needed. Maximum daily dose: 80 mL or 12 tablets.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustment may be needed. Close monitoring is necessary.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Contraindicated in severe renal impairment. Dosage adjustment is necessary in mild to moderate impairment.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution advised. Dosage adjustment may be necessary.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized assessment and dose adjustments.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication's use in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, and emergency situations is not routinely indicated.


### **Dosage Adjustments**
