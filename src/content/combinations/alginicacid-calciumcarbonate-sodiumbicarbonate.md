## **Usage**

- This combination medication is prescribed for the symptomatic treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its associated symptoms like heartburn, acid regurgitation, and indigestion (dyspepsia).  It is also used to relieve symptoms of hyperacidity, which can occur after meals or during pregnancy.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Antacid, anti-reflux agent.
- **Mechanism of action:** This combination works through a physical, rather than systemic, mechanism.  Sodium alginate reacts with gastric acid to create a viscous gel that floats on top of the stomach contents.  This gel barrier helps prevent reflux of stomach acid and bile into the esophagus.  Calcium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate are antacids that neutralize excess stomach acid, providing rapid relief from heartburn and indigestion.

## **Alternate Names**

- Compound alginate suspension, alginate-antacid combination, raft-forming alginate.
- **Brand names:** Gaviscon, Peptac, Algina, Acidex, Ariscon, Algiduo, Maharaft.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The primary effect is the formation of a protective gel barrier and the neutralization of gastric acid, reducing esophageal acid exposure. The gel also entraps bile and pepsin, preventing further esophageal irritation.  The antacids quickly increase gastric pH, providing rapid symptom relief. Minimal systemic absorption occurs.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** The action is primarily local in the stomach.  Minimal systemic absorption of the components occurs.  Any absorbed calcium or bicarbonate is excreted renally. Alginate is not absorbed and is eliminated through the gastrointestinal tract.
- **Mode of action:** Sodium alginate forms a gel by reacting with gastric acid. The entrapped carbon dioxide from the bicarbonate reaction makes the gel buoyant, forming a "raft" that floats on the stomach contents. This raft acts as a physical barrier against reflux. Calcium reinforces the gel structure. Sodium and calcium carbonate neutralize the acidity.  There is no significant receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation involved.
- **Elimination pathways:** Alginate is not absorbed systemically and is excreted in feces.  Absorbed calcium and bicarbonate are eliminated primarily through renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 10-20 ml or 2-4 tablets (depending on the formulation) after meals and at bedtime, up to four times a day.

#### **Children:**

- Children under 12:  Administer only on medical advice.
- Children 6-12 years: 5-10 ml or 1-2 tablets, after meals and at bedtime, as directed by a physician.
- Children under 6 years:  Generally not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustments are typically necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment due to the sodium content.  Dose reduction may be necessary if a highly restricted salt diet is recommended.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustments are typically required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with hypercalcemia, nephrocalcinosis, or recurrent calcium-containing renal calculi. In patients with congestive heart failure or on a low-sodium diet, caution is advised due to the sodium content.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication is not typically used in the clinical settings you mentioned (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations). It is indicated for the relief of intermittent symptoms related to GERD rather than acute medical interventions.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be needed based on the severity of symptoms and patient's renal function.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Constipation, flatulence, belching, nausea, stomach cramps.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), hypercalcemia (especially with prolonged high doses), and metabolic alkalosis.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

No long-term effects have been described specifically for this medication combination.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Hypersensitivity reactions, severe abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face/tongue/throat.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any of the components (alginic acid, calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, or any excipients).
- Moderate to severe renal insufficiency.
- Hypophosphatemia.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Antacids can interfere with the absorption of various medications, including tetracyclines, quinolones, fluoroquinolones, iron salts, ketoconazole, digoxin, certain antihypertensives, levothyroxine, and bisphosphonates.  A time interval of at least 2 hours between the administration of this combination and other medications is recommended.
- Antacids may alter the urinary pH, affecting the elimination of certain drugs.
- Concurrent use with alcohol can increase acid production and worsen heartburn.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Generally considered safe for use during pregnancy. Studies have not shown evidence of fetal harm.
- This medication is considered safe for use during breastfeeding. No adverse effects on infants have been reported.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Forms a raft-like barrier that floats on stomach contents, preventing reflux, and neutralizes stomach acid.
- **Side Effects:** Constipation, flatulence, belching. Rarely, allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, moderate to severe renal insufficiency.
- **Drug Interactions:** Can reduce absorption of several drugs; separate administration by 2 hours.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Generally considered safe.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 10-20 ml or 2-4 tablets after meals and at bedtime, up to 4 times/day. Children (6-12): 5-10ml.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for symptom relief, serum calcium levels (with long-term high-dose use), and signs of alkalosis.

## **Popular Combinations**

This product is itself a combination. It is often used alone.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess for pre-existing conditions like renal insufficiency, hypercalcemia, and allergies.
- **Specific Populations:**  Use with caution in those with renal disease and consider sodium content in patients with heart failure.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Advise patients to avoid alcohol, large meals, and trigger foods.
