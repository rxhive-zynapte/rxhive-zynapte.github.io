## **Usage**

This topical medication is primarily indicated for the management and prevention of scars resulting from various etiologies, including hypertrophic scars and keloids, surgical scars, scars from burns, trauma, and amputations, scars due to traumatic tendon contracture, stretch marks, and acne scars.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Dermatological agent, skin protectant, anti-scarring agent.

- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination product works through the synergistic effects of its components: allantoin promotes cell proliferation, wound healing, and skin softening; Allium cepa (onion extract) exerts anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and anti-fibroblastic properties; and heparin acts as an anti-inflammatory, improves tissue hydration, and softens scar tissue.


## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination. However, it is marketed under various brand names such as Contractubex, Antiscar, Scartubex, Hexilak Gel, Marksrub Super, and Scarderm.  Regional variations in brand names may occur.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  The combined effects of allantoin, Allium cepa, and heparin contribute to scar reduction by promoting cell regeneration, reducing inflammation, softening scar tissue, and inhibiting fibroblast proliferation. Allantoin stimulates cell proliferation and moisturizes the skin, while Allium cepa inhibits inflammatory mediators and fibroblast growth, exhibiting antibacterial properties. Heparin inhibits fibroblast proliferation and improves tissue hydration, aiding scar softening.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** This medication primarily exerts topical action, with limited systemic absorption.

- **Mode of Action:** Allantoin stimulates cellular proliferation and moisturizes the skin, promoting cell regeneration. Allium cepa inhibits inflammatory mediators and fibroblast growth, hindering excessive scar formation, and exhibits antibacterial effects. Heparin inhibits fibroblast proliferation, reducing scar tissue formation, while also improving tissue hydration, leading to softening of scar tissue.

- **Elimination:** Limited information is available on elimination pathways. Minimal systemic absorption suggests minimal systemic elimination.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a thin layer of gel to the affected area 3-4 times daily, massaging gently until absorbed. Treatment duration depends on scar maturity, size, and individual response, ranging from several weeks to months.

#### **Children:**

Use in children under one year of age is not recommended due to limited safety data. For children older than one year, apply the gel once or twice daily to the scar tissue, with close monitoring for adverse reactions.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically necessary. However, close monitoring for local skin reactions is recommended.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Exercise caution. Dosage adjustments might be required depending on the patient's clinical status and creatinine clearance. 
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Exercise caution. Dosage adjustments might be necessary depending on the patient's liver function tests and overall clinical condition.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Carefully evaluate individual patient factors, including concomitant medications and underlying diseases, and adjust dosage or frequency as needed.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical settings generally adhere to the standard dosage guidelines, considering the scar's etiology and characteristics.  Specific clinical scenarios, such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations, do not necessitate alternative dosing regimens for this topical medication.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments should be based on individual patient factors, including renal or hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism. These adjustments may include reducing the application frequency or the amount of gel applied.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Pruritus, erythema, burning or stinging sensation upon application, and mild skin irritation at the application site.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions, although rare, may manifest as severe skin reactions, including urticaria, angioedema, or difficulty breathing.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

No significant long-term adverse effects have been reported with the topical use of this medication.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
