## **Usage**

This topical cream combines antiseptic, antibacterial, and healing properties. It is prescribed for the treatment and prevention of skin infections, particularly in burns (first-degree/superficial), minor cuts, wounds, sores, insect bites, rashes, abrasions, surgical cuts, leg ulcers, pressure sores, blisters, and cracked skin. It can also be used prophylactically at skin graft donor sites.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antiseptic, antibacterial, wound healing agent.

**Mechanism of Action:**  The cream exerts its therapeutic effects through the combined action of its individual components: Silver nitrate and Chlorhexidine gluconate act as antiseptics and antibacterial agents, eliminating a broad spectrum of bacteria. Aloe vera provides soothing and healing benefits, promoting skin regeneration and reducing inflammation. Allantoin functions as a keratolytic and moisturizing agent, softening the skin and facilitating tissue repair.


## **Alternate Names**

* Silvacure+
* Burnosept Plus
* Other brand names may exist regionally.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The combined effect of silver nitrate and chlorhexidine gluconate delivers a broad-spectrum antimicrobial action. Aloe vera and allantoin contribute to wound healing and diminish inflammation.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Topical application results in minimal systemic absorption. The components exert their primary action at the application site.  The elimination pathways for the individual components have not been well established following combined topical use.

**Mode of Action:**

* **Silver Nitrate:** Releases silver ions that disrupt bacterial cell walls and membranes, leading to bacterial death.
* **Chlorhexidine Gluconate:**  Binds to bacterial cell walls, disrupting their integrity and causing cell death.
* **Aloe Vera:** Contains various compounds with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and wound-healing properties.  It promotes skin regeneration and reduces inflammation.
* **Allantoin:**  Facilitates cell proliferation and tissue repair, contributing to wound healing. It also softens and moisturizes the skin.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Children:**  Apply a thin layer to the affected area 1-2 times daily or as directed by a physician. Pediatric safety considerations include avoiding application to large areas of broken skin in infants and young children due to the potential for systemic absorption of silver nitrate.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required, but monitor for skin sensitivity.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment is not typically necessary due to minimal systemic absorption.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustment is not typically necessary due to minimal systemic absorption.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific adjustments are typically required, but consider individual patient factors.

### **Clinical Use Cases:**

Dosage in clinical use cases generally aligns with the standard dosage recommendations. Specific adjustments may be made based on the severity and extent of the wound or burn.
