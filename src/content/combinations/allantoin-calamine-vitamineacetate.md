## **Usage**

This topical medication combines calamine, allantoin, and vitamin E acetate. It's a skin protectant used to relieve itching and irritation caused by minor skin ailments like rashes, eczema, insect bites, sunburn, and dry/flaky skin.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Skin protectant, anti-pruritic, mild anti-inflammatory, emollient.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Calamine provides a cooling sensation and has mild astringent properties. Allantoin promotes cell regeneration, wound healing, and moisturizes. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting the skin from free radical damage, and supports healing by boosting collagen production and skin hydration.

## **Alternate Names**

Calamine + Allantoin + Vitamin E Acetate Lotion; Calasoft Lotion; Calora Lotion.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The combination offers a synergistic effect by addressing multiple aspects of skin irritation and healing: soothing, protecting, moisturizing, and promoting tissue regeneration.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily topical action with minimal systemic absorption.

- **Mode of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Not applicable for this topical combination as its action is primarily local and physical, not systemic.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Minimal systemic absorption, so elimination is negligible.  Any small amount absorbed is likely metabolized and excreted through normal metabolic pathways.
