## **Usage**

- This combination medication is prescribed for the treatment of anorectal disorders, including hemorrhoids (piles), anal fissures, and anal pruritus (itching). It is also used in pre- and post-operative care for anorectal examinations and proctologic surgery.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product encompassing multiple classifications:
    - Anti-inflammatory (Hydrocortisone)
    - Local anesthetic (Lidocaine)
    - Skin protectant (Allantoin, Zinc Oxide)
    - Astringent (Zinc Oxide)
- **Mechanism of Action:**  The components work synergistically to provide comprehensive relief:
    - Allantoin promotes cell proliferation and tissue regeneration, aiding wound healing.
    - Hydrocortisone suppresses inflammation by inhibiting prostaglandin and leukotriene production.
    - Lidocaine blocks nerve signals, providing local anesthesia and relieving pain.
    - Zinc oxide forms a protective barrier, reducing irritation and promoting healing, while also exhibiting mild astringent and antiseptic properties.

## **Alternate Names**

- While no specific alternate names exist for the combination as a whole, the individual components may have synonyms (e.g., lignocaine for lidocaine).
- **Brand Names:** Examples include Anaproct, Pileum, Anomex, Corect, PYL-X, and Shield.  Availability may vary regionally.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  The combined effects result in decreased inflammation, pain relief, reduced itching, and accelerated healing in the anorectal area.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Lidocaine is absorbed systemically following topical application to mucous membranes. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted renally.
    - Hydrocortisone can also be absorbed systemically, especially with prolonged or extensive use.  
    - Allantoin and zinc oxide primarily exert their effects locally with minimal systemic absorption.
- **Mode of Action:**  See "Mechanism of Action" under "Usage."
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**  Hydrocortisone binds to glucocorticoid receptors. Lidocaine blocks sodium channels in nerve fibers.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Apply ointment or insert suppository two to three times daily, typically after bowel movements.  Treatment duration should generally not exceed 7 days unless under medical supervision.

#### **Children:** Use in children under 12 is generally not recommended. Consult a pediatrician if necessary.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution and monitor for systemic corticosteroid side effects, especially with prolonged use.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution advised, especially with prolonged use.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Lidocaine is metabolized hepatically; dosage adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution in patients with conditions that may be exacerbated by corticosteroids (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, glaucoma, osteoporosis).

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Dosage for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations is generally the same as the standard dosage. The clinical context might necessitate more frequent application.  However, prolonged use should still be avoided unless under strict medical supervision.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjust based on patient response and tolerance.  Consider renal/hepatic function and comorbid conditions.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**
- Burning, itching, irritation, dryness, and redness at the application site.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
