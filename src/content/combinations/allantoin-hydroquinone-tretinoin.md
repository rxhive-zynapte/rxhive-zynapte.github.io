## **Usage**

- This topical medication is primarily prescribed for the treatment of **melasma**, also known as chloasma or "mask of pregnancy."  Melasma presents as symmetrical, grey-brown or brown patches on sun-exposed areas, especially the face. It's more common in women, particularly during pregnancy or menopause.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing a depigmenting agent (hydroquinone), a retinoid (tretinoin), and a skin protectant (allantoin).  It can be considered a skin-lightening or bleaching agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Hydroquinone decreases melanin production by inhibiting tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for melanin synthesis. Tretinoin increases skin cell turnover, promoting the shedding of hyperpigmented cells. Allantoin moisturizes and softens the skin, reducing irritation caused by tretinoin and hydroquinone, while promoting the breakdown of keratin and removing dead skin cells.


## **Alternate Names**

- No official alternate names exist for this specific combination, though individual ingredients have other names (e.g., tretinoin is also retinoic acid).
- **Brand Names:**  Several brand names exist, such as Melapik Ever New, Lumadip, and Skinlite Ever, among others.  Availability and specific brand names may vary by region.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Hydroquinone's depigmenting effect results from tyrosinase inhibition.  Tretinoin modulates cell proliferation and differentiation, leading to increased epidermal cell turnover and shedding of pigmented cells. Allantoin acts as an emollient and keratolytic agent, moisturizing, softening, and promoting exfoliation of the skin.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Following topical application, systemic absorption is minimal for all three components.
- **Mode of Action:** Hydroquinone acts by inhibiting tyrosinase, which reduces melanin formation within melanocytes. Tretinoin binds to retinoic acid receptors within the skin, increasing cell turnover rate. Allantoin promotes cell proliferation and tissue repair.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Topical application, Minimal systemic absorption.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- A thin layer is applied to the affected areas once daily, typically at night or at least 30 minutes before bedtime, or as prescribed. Application should typically be made to melasma-affected skin, including roughly a 1.25cm border of unaffected skin, surrounding the visibly affected skin.
