## **Usage**

Almagate + Simethicone is indicated for the symptomatic relief of dyspepsia, heartburn, acid indigestion, and gas-related discomfort, including bloating, upper GI pressure, fullness, and abdominal distension.  It is also used to relieve postoperative gas pains and prior to gastroscopy or radiography of the intestine to enhance visualization and reduce gas shadows.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**
    - Almagate: Antacid
    - Simethicone: Antiflatulent

- **Mechanism of Action:**
    - Almagate neutralizes gastric acid, thereby reducing the symptoms of heartburn and acid indigestion.
    - Simethicone reduces the surface tension of gas bubbles trapped in the gastrointestinal tract, allowing them to coalesce and be expelled more easily through belching or flatus.

## **Alternate Names**

No widely used alternate names exist for the combined product.  It is often marketed under various brand names.

- Almagate: aluminum magnesium hydroxide, hydrated magnesium aluminate
- Simethicone: activated dimethicone, polydimethylsiloxane



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Almagate chemically neutralizes gastric hydrochloric acid, increasing gastric pH and providing relief from heartburn and acid indigestion. Simethicone acts physically by reducing the surface tension of gas bubbles, promoting their coalescence and expulsion.  It has no effect on gas production.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Almagate: Not absorbed systemically; action is localized to the gastrointestinal tract; excreted in feces.
    - Simethicone: Not absorbed systemically; passes through the GI tract unchanged; excreted in feces.
- **Mode of Action:**
    - Almagate: Acts via chemical neutralization of acid.
    - Simethicone:  Acts via physical alteration of gas bubble surface tension.  No receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation is involved.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily fecal elimination for both components.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One to two teaspoonfuls or tablets/chewable tablets (check specific product instructions for the amount of Almagate and Simethicone) after meals and at bedtime, as needed.  Do not exceed 500 mg of simethicone daily unless under a doctor's direction.

#### **Children:**

- Infants and Children under 2 years: 20 mg of simethicone orally four times daily as needed after meals and at bedtime. The maximum daily dose is 240 mg.
- Children 2-12 years: 40 mg of simethicone orally four times daily as needed after meals and at bedtime. The maximum daily dose is 480 mg.  Weight-based dosing should be used when possible.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution; adjust dose based on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; dose adjustments may be needed. Avoid use in patients with renal failure.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments are typically necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with diabetes, electrolyte imbalances, or other conditions that may be affected by antacid use.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in clinical settings for Almagate + Simethicone is based on the standard dosage recommendations, adjusted as needed per individual patient requirements and the specific clinical scenario.  Consult product specific prescribing information.

- **Intubation:** Not typically indicated.
- **Surgical Procedures:** May be used postoperatively for relief of gas pains.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not typically indicated.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Not typically indicated.
- **Emergency Situations:** Not typically indicated.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments should be made for patients with renal impairment. Always refer to the manufacturer's instructions for the particular Almagate + Simethicone product.  The simethicone component dosage generally should not exceed 500 mg daily, unless directed by a physician.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
Constipation, diarrhea, nausea


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), hypermagnesemia (especially in patients with renal impairment), phosphate depletion (with long-term or high-dose use)

### **Long-Term Effects**

Osteomalacia (with prolonged use of high doses, especially in patients with low phosphate intake)


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to Almagate, Simethicone or any component of the formulation. Severe renal failure.

## **Drug Interactions**

Antacids can interfere with the absorption of many medications.  Administer other medications at least 1-2 hours before or after Almagate + Simethicone.  Consult a drug interaction database for a comprehensive list of potential interactions.  Some notable examples include:

- Levothyroxine
- Tetracycline antibiotics
- Quinolone antibiotics (e.g., ciprofloxacin)
- Iron supplements
- Digoxin
- Pazopanib


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult a physician before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  While generally considered safe, the benefits should outweigh the risks.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Almagate neutralizes gastric acid. Simethicone reduces the surface tension of gas bubbles.
- **Side Effects:** Constipation, diarrhea, nausea. Rarely: allergic reactions, hypermagnesemia, phosphate depletion.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe renal failure.
- **Drug Interactions:** Numerous; consult drug interaction resources.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult physician before use.
- **Dosage:** See detailed dosage section above.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for side effects, particularly in patients with renal impairment. Monitor phosphate levels with prolonged or high-dose use.

## **Popular Combinations**

Almagate and Simethicone are commonly combined into single formulations for managing both acid indigestion and gas symptoms concurrently.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess renal function, particularly in elderly patients.  Caution in patients with diabetes or on phosphate-restricted diets.
- **Specific Populations:**  See special cases in dosage section.  Consult physician if pregnant or breastfeeding.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Lifestyle modifications, such as avoiding trigger foods and managing stress, may be beneficial.
