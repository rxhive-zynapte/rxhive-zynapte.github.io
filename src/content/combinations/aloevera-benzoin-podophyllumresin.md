## **Usage**

This topical medication is primarily indicated for the treatment of external genital warts (condylomata acuminata) caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). It may also be used for other types of warts, such as plantar warts, but with caution.  It is not effective against subclinical HPV infections (without visible warts).

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Keratolytic agent (Salicylic acid if present), antimitotic agent (Podophyllum resin), topical antiviral (Podophyllum resin)

- **Mechanism of Action:** Podophyllum resin exerts its effect by inhibiting mitosis at metaphase, leading to the destruction of wart tissue. If present, salicylic acid enhances this keratolytic action by breaking down keratin. Benzoin acts as a protectant and may possess mild antiseptic properties. Aloe vera soothes and moisturizes the surrounding skin, reducing potential irritation.

## **Alternate Names**

- Podowart Paint
- Podowart
- Podocon-25® (25% Podophyllin in benzoin tincture)
- Wartsrub-S Paint (when combined with salicylic acid)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Podophyllum resin's primary effect is cytotoxic, disrupting cell division and leading to wart tissue death. Salicylic acid, when present, enhances this effect through its keratolytic action.  Benzoin and aloe vera provide protective and soothing effects, respectively.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily topical application. Systemic absorption is minimal with proper application.  Avoid application to large areas or broken skin to minimize systemic exposure.  The metabolic fate of podophyllum resin applied topically is not well-characterized.
- **Mode of Action:** Podophyllum resin acts as a tubulin polymerization inhibitor, specifically targeting the mitotic spindle apparatus. It arrests cell division at metaphase.  Salicylic acid, if present, increases the permeability of the skin, promoting the penetration of podophyllum resin.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Podophyllum resin inhibits tubulin polymerization.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Minimal systemic absorption. Elimination pathways are not clearly defined for topical application.  Any absorbed podophyllum resin is likely metabolized in the liver and excreted through the kidneys.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer of the solution directly to the wart using an applicator, typically once or twice daily. Avoid contact with healthy skin. Allow the solution to dry completely. Treatment may be repeated weekly for up to six weeks for genital warts and once daily for other warts. Maximum treatment area should not exceed 10 cm² and a total of <0.5 mL of the solution per application.

#### **Children:**  Use in children is not recommended unless under strict medical supervision due to the potential for systemic toxicity. Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments, but use with caution due to potentially thinner skin.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically needed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific guidelines, but consider individual patient factors.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This topical preparation is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its use is restricted to topical wart treatment.

### **Dosage Adjustments:** No specific dosage adjustments are defined beyond the standard recommendations. Use with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:** Local skin reactions like mild burning, stinging, itching, redness, and inflammation at the application site are common.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:** Peripheral neuropathy (with prolonged or excessive use), severe local skin reactions (ulceration, necrosis), potential for systemic toxicity if absorbed (especially in children).

### **Long-Term Effects:**  Chronic skin irritation, potential for scarring with improper or excessive application.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** Severe local reactions (ulceration, necrosis), systemic toxicity (nausea, vomiting, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), and peripheral neuropathy.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any of the components.
- Pregnancy (contraindicated)
- Breastfeeding (contraindicated)
- Open wounds or broken skin around the wart.
- Warts larger than 3 cm.
- Cervical, urethral, rectal, or anal warts (not recommended)

## **Drug Interactions**

- No specific drug interactions are documented.  However, use with caution when other topical medications are being used in the same area.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Contraindicated (potential teratogenic effects).

- **Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated as it may be excreted in breast milk and pose a risk to the infant.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits mitosis, leading to wart tissue death. Salicylic acid (if present) enhances keratolysis.
- **Side Effects:** Local skin irritation (common), severe local reactions, systemic toxicity (rare).
- **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, breastfeeding, open wounds, hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:** None specifically documented.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
- **Dosage:** Topical application, once or twice daily, up to six weeks for genital warts.

## **Popular Combinations**

Not generally used in combination with other drugs for wart treatment.

## **Precautions**
- **General Precautions:** Protect surrounding healthy skin with petroleum jelly or zinc oxide.
- **Specific Populations:** Contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Use cautiously in children and the elderly.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:**  No specific lifestyle considerations.
