## **Usage**

- This topical medication is primarily prescribed for minor skin irritations and itching caused by conditions such as urticaria, insect bites, insect stings, prickly heat, sunburn, napkin rash, cosmetic rashes, pruritus of dry skin, and chicken pox. It is also used for moisturizing and softening the skin.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Topical protectant, antipruritic, emollient.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Calamine has mild astringent and antipruritic properties, which help to soothe itching and inflammation. Liquid paraffin acts as an emollient, moisturizing and softening the skin. Aloe vera provides anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects, further soothing and moisturizing the skin while promoting healing.

## **Alternate Names**

- There are no widely recognized alternate names for this combination product itself, although individual components have other names (e.g., zinc oxide and ferric oxide for calamine).
- **Brand Names:** Calovera, Sanimoist, Verasoft (and potentially others depending on the manufacturer).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Calamine reduces itching and inflammation through its astringent properties. Liquid paraffin creates a protective barrier on the skin, preventing water loss and maintaining hydration. Aloe vera contributes to the anti-inflammatory and healing effects.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily topical action; minimal systemic absorption.  The components are not expected to be significantly absorbed into the bloodstream.
- **Mode of Action:** Calamine's astringent properties are thought to be related to protein precipitation and a reduction in capillary permeability, thus easing inflammation. Liquid paraffin works by forming an occlusive barrier, reducing transepidermal water loss and increasing skin hydration. Aloe vera exerts its effects through several mechanisms, including reducing inflammation and enhancing cell proliferation, likely involving various molecular pathways.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Not applicable due to minimal systemic absorption. Residual product is removed by washing or natural shedding of skin cells.
