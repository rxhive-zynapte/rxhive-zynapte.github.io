      How does Alogliptin + Metformin work?**


      **A:** Alogliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon release
      by inhibiting DPP-4. Metformin reduces hepatic glucose production,
      decreases intestinal glucose absorption, and improves insulin sensitivity.

      What is lactic acidosis and how does it relate to this medicine?**


      **A:** Lactic acidosis is a rare but serious side effect primarily
      associated with metformin.  It's characterized by a buildup of lactic acid
      in the blood. Risk factors include renal impairment, dehydration, and
      excessive alcohol consumption. Patients should be educated on recognizing
      the symptoms (e.g., muscle pain, weakness, nausea, vomiting, difficulty
      breathing).

## **Usage**

- Alogliptin + Metformin is prescribed for type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control. It is used when metformin alone or metformin combined with other oral antidiabetic medications, including pioglitazone or insulin, do not provide adequate glycemic control. It is not indicated for type 1 diabetes.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antidiabetic combination; Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor (alogliptin) and biguanide (metformin).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Alogliptin increases incretin levels (e.g., GLP-1 and GIP), which in turn increase insulin secretion and decrease glucagon secretion, especially after meals.  Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal glucose absorption, and improves insulin sensitivity.

## **Alternate Names**

- Alogliptin benzoate/metformin HCl
- Alogliptin benzoate/metformin hydrochloride
- **Brand Names:** Kazano, Vipdomet


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Alogliptin enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppresses glucagon secretion. Metformin reduces hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal glucose absorption, and improves peripheral insulin sensitivity.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Both drugs are orally administered. Alogliptin is rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolized, primarily via CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, with renal elimination being the major route.  Metformin is absorbed slowly and incompletely, is not metabolized, and is excreted primarily by the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:** Alogliptin inhibits DPP-4, the enzyme responsible for degrading incretins like GLP-1 and GIP. Metformin's exact mechanism is not fully understood but involves activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Alogliptin inhibits DPP-4. Metformin activates AMPK.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Alogliptin is primarily eliminated renally.  Metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial: Alogliptin 12.5 mg + Metformin 500 mg or 1000 mg twice daily, orally with food.
- Maintenance: Adjust based on efficacy and tolerability up to a maximum of Alogliptin 25 mg + Metformin 2000 mg per day.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended. Safety and efficacy not established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a low dose and titrate cautiously due to potential renal impairment.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Contraindicated in severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²). Not recommended in moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m²). Dose reduction may be required for mild renal impairment. 
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Not recommended.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or a history of pancreatitis.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Not typically used in acute clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.  Its primary role is in the chronic management of type 2 diabetes.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjust based on renal function, hepatic function, and concomitant medications.  If eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m², reassess the risks and benefits of continuing therapy.  Temporarily discontinue before procedures requiring iodinated contrast media.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis
- Diarrhea

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Vitamin B12 deficiency (with long-term metformin use)

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe hypersensitivity reactions



## **Contraindications**

- Severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²)
- Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis

## **Drug Interactions**

- Alcohol (increased risk of lactic acidosis)

-  Some diuretics, corticosteroids (hyperglycemia)
-  Insulin secretagogues, insulin (hypoglycemia)



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (Australia); Not assigned (US FDA).
- Insufficient data in humans. Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy poses risks to both mother and fetus. Metformin has been associated with some fetal risks at very high doses in animal studies.  Alogliptin crosses the placenta in rats.
- Not recommended during breastfeeding (metformin is excreted in breast milk).
