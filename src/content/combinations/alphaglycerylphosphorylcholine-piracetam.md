## **Usage**

- This combination is prescribed to enhance cognitive abilities, particularly in conditions like Alzheimer's disease, dementia, stroke, head injury, and learning disorders.  It may also be used to control myoclonic movements, such as those seen in Parkinsonism and hiccups.
- **Pharmacological Classification**: Nootropic, Cholinergic, Cognitive Enhancer.
- **Mechanism of Action**: Alpha-GPC increases acetylcholine levels in the brain, a neurotransmitter essential for memory and learning. Piracetam enhances acetylcholine activity and improves communication between nerve cells, further boosting cognitive function and cerebral blood flow.

## **Alternate Names**

- Alpha-GPC + Piracetam
- **Brand Names**:  Piranulin, Pira GPC, Pizalin, PATRICETAM GPC


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**:  Alpha-GPC acts as a choline donor, increasing acetylcholine synthesis and release. Acetylcholine is a key neurotransmitter involved in memory, learning, and other cognitive functions. Piracetam's mechanism is not fully understood, but it is thought to modulate neuronal excitability, enhance acetylcholine receptor function, improve cerebral blood flow, and offer neuroprotective effects.
- **Pharmacokinetics**: Alpha-GPC is rapidly absorbed and crosses the blood-brain barrier efficiently. Piracetam is also well-absorbed orally, with peak plasma concentrations reached within 1-2 hours.  Both drugs are primarily excreted renally.  Limited information on specific metabolic pathways and CYP enzyme involvement is available for this combination.
- **Mode of Action**: Alpha-GPC provides the necessary substrate for acetylcholine production. Piracetam modulates AMPA and NMDA receptors, increasing neuronal excitability and facilitating synaptic plasticity. It also promotes blood flow and oxygen delivery to the brain, contributing to improved cognitive performance.
- **Elimination Pathways**: Primarily renal excretion for both components.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults**:

- A common ratio is 400 mg Alpha-GPC to 1600 mg Piracetam. This can be taken one to two times a day, preferably with meals.  Some sources suggest up to 1200 mg Alpha-GPC and 4800 mg Piracetam daily, divided into multiple doses. The optimal dosage and frequency should be determined based on individual patient needs and response.

#### **Children**:

- Limited data available. Consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosing based on weight or age, considering potential safety concerns.

#### **Special Cases**:

- **Elderly Patients**:  Start with a lower dose and adjust gradually, monitoring for side effects and potential drug interactions. Renal function should be assessed.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Dose reduction is necessary based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**:  Caution is advised due to limited data on drug metabolism in these patients.  Close monitoring is recommended.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Consider potential drug interactions and adjust dosage accordingly, particularly in patients with hypotension, bleeding problems, epilepsy, or those taking thyroid hormones, anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or calcium channel blockers.
