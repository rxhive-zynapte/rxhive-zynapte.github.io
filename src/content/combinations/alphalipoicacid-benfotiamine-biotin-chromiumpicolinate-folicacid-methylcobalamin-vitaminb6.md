## **Usage**

This combination of vitamins and other nutrients is primarily used as a dietary supplement to address deficiencies in these specific nutrients.  It's often prescribed for conditions like diabetic neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage often causing numbness, tingling, and pain in the hands and feet), and other neurological conditions.  It may also be used to improve energy levels and overall metabolic function.  While not strictly fitting into a single pharmacological classification, its components have various roles: metabolic support, antioxidant, nerve function support.

This combination works synergistically to support nerve health and metabolic function.  Alpha-lipoic acid acts as an antioxidant, while benfotiamine (a fat-soluble form of vitamin B1) helps prevent nerve damage. Biotin is vital for cell growth, and chromium picolinate aids insulin function. Folic acid and methylcobalamin (vitamin B12) play crucial roles in nerve cell function and red blood cell production. Finally, vitamin B6 contributes to the overall functioning of the nervous system.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no single official alternate name for this specific combination product. It is typically referred to by its constituent ingredients.  Brand names for similar combination products may vary depending on the manufacturer and region. One example found was "Infivita."

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  This combination influences numerous metabolic pathways. Alpha-lipoic acid acts as a potent antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Benfotiamine enhances transketolase activity, a key enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, thus preventing the accumulation of harmful metabolites that contribute to nerve damage. Biotin plays a crucial role in cellular metabolism and gene expression. Chromium picolinate enhances insulin sensitivity, improving glucose metabolism. Folic acid and methylcobalamin are essential for DNA synthesis, cell division, and nerve function. Vitamin B6 contributes to neurotransmitter synthesis and nervous system function.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Each component has unique absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion characteristics.  Alpha-lipoic acid is well-absorbed orally, but absorption can be enhanced with food.  Benfotiamine, as a fat-soluble form of thiamine, is absorbed differently than water-soluble thiamine. Biotin is absorbed in the small intestine, and chromium picolinate has varying absorption rates. Folic acid is absorbed in the jejunum, and methylcobalamin requires intrinsic factor for absorption.  Vitamin B6 is absorbed in the small intestine.

**Elimination Pathways:** Individual components are eliminated through various pathways. Alpha-lipoic acid and its metabolites are primarily excreted renally.  Benfotiamine follows thiamine metabolism with excretion through urine. Biotin is excreted in urine and bile.  Chromium is excreted mainly in urine.  Folic acid is excreted in urine and bile. Methylcobalamin undergoes enterohepatic circulation and is excreted primarily in bile.  Vitamin B6 is excreted in urine.

## **Dosage**

Dosage is dependent on the specific product formulation and the patient's individual needs. Always follow the prescribing physician's recommendations.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Dosages can vary; some formulations suggest one capsule daily. However, dosage depends on the specific product and its concentration of each ingredient.

#### **Children:**  There is no established standard dosage for children. Consult a pediatrician before administration.
