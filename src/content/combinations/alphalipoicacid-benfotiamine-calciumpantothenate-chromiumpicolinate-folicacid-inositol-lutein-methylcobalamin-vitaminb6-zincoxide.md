## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as a dietary supplement to address nutritional deficiencies, especially concerning B vitamins, zinc, and chromium. It's also prescribed for specific medical conditions like:

*   **Diabetic Neuropathy:** Methylcobalamin, alpha-lipoic acid, benfotiamine, and vitamin B6 contribute to nerve health and may alleviate diabetic neuropathy symptoms.
*   **Metabolic Support:** Chromium picolinate, inositol, and zinc participate in metabolic processes, supporting overall metabolic health.
*   **Nutritional Deficiency:** This combination addresses deficiencies in the various components, including B vitamins, zinc, and chromium.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This combination spans several classifications due to its diverse components: vitamins, minerals, antioxidants (alpha-lipoic acid), and metabolic agents.


## **Alternate Names**

This combination lacks a specific brand name or widely recognized alternate name. It's often referred to by its individual components. Some example brand names include Neurafol Plus and Urjavit.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics:**

The mechanism of action is multifaceted, reflecting the individual components' actions:

*   **Methylcobalamin:** Crucial for nerve function, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell formation.
*   **Alpha-Lipoic Acid:** Antioxidant, potentially improving glucose uptake.
*   **Benfotiamine:** Fat-soluble vitamin B1 derivative, increases thiamine levels, vital for carbohydrate metabolism.
*   **Calcium Pantothenate:** Part of coenzyme A, essential for energy metabolism and fatty acid synthesis.
*   **Chromium Picolinate:** Enhances insulin action, improving glucose metabolism.
*   **Folic Acid:**  Essential for cell growth and division, particularly red blood cells, prevents DNA changes.
*   **Inositol:** A type of sugar, balances body chemicals and aids brain signal transmission.
*   **Lutein:** Antioxidant, protects eye health.
*   **Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine):**  Essential for protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism, neurotransmitter and red blood cell production.
*   **Zinc Oxide:** Supports immune function, wound healing, and cell growth.

**Mode of Action:** The components act on various pathways. For instance, methylcobalamin is involved in DNA and myelin synthesis. Alpha-lipoic acid neutralizes free radicals. Benfotiamine enhances transketolase activity.  Chromium picolinate influences insulin receptors. 


**Elimination:** Elimination pathways vary by component. Most are renally excreted, either unchanged or as metabolites. Some, like alpha-lipoic acid, undergo hepatic metabolism.
