## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to address deficiencies and support nerve health, particularly in conditions like diabetic neuropathy and peripheral neuropathy. It may also be used for conditions such as vitamin B deficiencies, metabolic syndrome, and to support overall health.  It's not classified as a single drug belonging to a specific pharmacological class (e.g., antibiotic, analgesic) but rather as a dietary supplement containing multiple ingredients.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is often referred to by its component ingredients or by brand names like Lipo ACE. Other brand names may exist depending on the manufacturer.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The components work synergistically to support nerve health, improve metabolic function, and protect against oxidative stress.

* **Alpha Lipoic Acid:** Antioxidant, protects nerves from damage, improves blood flow, and may enhance glucose utilization.

* **Benfotiamine:** Fat-soluble form of vitamin B1 (thiamine), supports nerve function, and protects against advanced glycation end products (AGEs) associated with diabetic complications.

* **Chromium Picolinate:** Enhances insulin action, improving blood sugar control.

* **Folic Acid (Vitamin B9):** Essential for cell growth and division, red blood cell formation, and nerve function. Reduces homocysteine levels, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

* **Inositol:**  Plays a role in nerve signal transmission and may improve insulin sensitivity.

* **Lutein:** Antioxidant, specifically protective of eye health.

* **Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B12):** Essential for nerve health, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell formation.

* **Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6):** Involved in nerve function, red blood cell formation, and the synthesis of neurotransmitters.

* **Zinc Oxide:** Supports immune function, wound healing, and cell growth.


**Pharmacokinetics:** Absorption, metabolism, and elimination vary for each component.  Consult individual drug profiles for specific information.



## **Dosage**

Dosage varies depending on the formulation and manufacturer's recommendations. Always consult the product labeling and a healthcare professional for individualized guidance.


### **Standard Dosage**
