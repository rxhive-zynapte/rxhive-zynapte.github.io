## **Usage**

This combination of ingredients is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to address deficiencies and support nerve health. It is often prescribed for conditions like diabetic neuropathy, neurodegenerative diseases, and neuropsychiatric disorders.  It doesn't fall neatly into a single pharmacological classification but encompasses vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals.

The mechanism of action involves multiple pathways:
* **Benfotiamine:**  Improves glucose metabolism and reduces the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which contribute to nerve damage.
* **Methylcobalamin:**  A form of vitamin B12 vital for nerve cell function and regeneration.
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid:** A potent antioxidant that protects nerve cells from damage.
* **Myo-Inositol:** Plays a role in nerve signal transmission and may have mood-stabilizing effects.
* **Chromium Picolinate:** Enhances insulin action, improving glucose control.
* **Folic Acid:** Necessary for cell growth and division, and contributes to nerve function.
* **Selenium:** An antioxidant that protects against oxidative stress.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination doesn't have a single, universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN). It's commonly referred to by the individual ingredient names. Some brand names include Nuhenz.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The combined effects of the ingredients contribute to nerve health by improving glucose metabolism, reducing oxidative stress, promoting nerve regeneration, and supporting nerve function.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The individual components have different absorption, metabolism, and elimination profiles.  
* Water-soluble vitamins like methylcobalamin and folic acid are readily absorbed and excreted renally. 
* Alpha-lipoic acid is also absorbed well and undergoes both renal and hepatic elimination. 
* Benfotiamine, a lipid-soluble form of thiamine, is absorbed better than thiamine itself. 
* Chromium is poorly absorbed and eliminated mostly in the urine.
* Selenium is absorbed in the small intestine and excreted via urine and feces.

**Mode of Action:**  The ingredients act synergistically at cellular and molecular levels. Benfotiamine improves glucose metabolism by activating transketolase, a key enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway. Methylcobalamin is essential for myelin synthesis and nerve regeneration.  Alpha-lipoic acid and selenium act as antioxidants, scavenging free radicals. Chromium enhances insulin sensitivity, and Myo-inositol contributes to cell signaling and membrane stability.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  The ingredients don't have specific receptor binding or neurotransmitter modulation effects.  However, some, like benfotiamine, affect enzyme activity.

**Elimination Pathways:** As noted earlier, most components are eliminated renally, with some also undergoing hepatic metabolism.
