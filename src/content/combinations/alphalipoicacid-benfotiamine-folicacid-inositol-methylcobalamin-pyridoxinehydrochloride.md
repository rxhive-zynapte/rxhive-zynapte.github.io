## **Usage**

This combination of nutrients is primarily prescribed for the management of peripheral neuropathy, especially diabetic neuropathy. It is also used to address vitamin deficiencies and support nerve health, improve metabolic health, and enhance antioxidant defense.  Its pharmacological classification is a nutritional supplement.

The mechanism of action involves multiple pathways:

* **Alpha-lipoic acid:** Acts as an antioxidant, improves glucose uptake, and reduces inflammation.
* **Benfotiamine:** Improves thiamine utilization, essential for nerve function and carbohydrate metabolism.
* **Folic acid and Methylcobalamin:**  Essential for homocysteine metabolism and nerve cell regeneration.
* **Inositol:** Improves insulin sensitivity and nerve function.
* **Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6):**  Supports nerve health and neurotransmitter synthesis.


## **Alternate Names**

There is no officially recognized alternate name for this specific combination.  However, it may be referred to as a "B-vitamin complex with alpha-lipoic acid and inositol." Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer.  Some examples include Sarfast-CD3.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  The combined effect of these ingredients targets various aspects of nerve health, metabolism, and antioxidant defense.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Each component has its own absorption, metabolism, and elimination profile.

* **Alpha-lipoic acid:**  Readily absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, and excreted renally.
* **Benfotiamine:**  Lipid-soluble form of thiamine, better absorbed than thiamine hydrochloride.
* **Folic acid:**  Absorbed in the small intestine.
* **Inositol:** Found naturally in the body, supplemental form is absorbed and distributed widely.
* **Methylcobalamin:**  Active form of vitamin B12, absorbed and stored in the liver.
* **Pyridoxine:** Absorbed in the small intestine and metabolized in the liver.

**Mode of Action:**

* **Antioxidant activity:** Alpha-lipoic acid scavenges free radicals, reducing oxidative stress.
* **Nerve function support:** B vitamins, including benfotiamine, methylcobalamin, and pyridoxine, play crucial roles in nerve cell maintenance and repair.
* **Metabolic regulation:** Alpha-lipoic acid and inositol improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism.
* **Homocysteine reduction:** Folic acid and methylcobalamin reduce homocysteine levels, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and neuropathy.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Typical dosage is one tablet or capsule daily, but it can vary based on the specific product and the patient's needs.  It's crucial to follow the manufacturer's or the prescribing physician's recommendations.
