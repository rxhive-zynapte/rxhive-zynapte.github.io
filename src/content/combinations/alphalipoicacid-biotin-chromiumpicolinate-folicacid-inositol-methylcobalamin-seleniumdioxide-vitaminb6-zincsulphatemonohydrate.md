## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as a dietary supplement to address deficiencies in the listed vitamins and minerals and potentially manage or improve symptoms of certain conditions like diabetic neuropathy. It also aims to promote healthy blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, not a single drug belonging to a specific pharmacological class.  It encompasses multiple categories due to its varied components.

**Mechanism of Action:**  The components have synergistic effects on nerve health, glucose metabolism, and cellular protection.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination does not have a specific brand name or a widely recognized alternate name. It is generally referred to by its component ingredients. Some example brand names include Macbeta and Miol-OD.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Each component contributes to the overall effect:

* **Alpha Lipoic Acid:** Antioxidant, improves nerve conduction, and may enhance glucose utilization.
* **Biotin:**  Essential for cell growth, metabolism of fatty acids, and glucose utilization.
* **Chromium Picolinate:** Enhances insulin action, aiding glucose metabolism.
* **Folic Acid:** Essential for cell division and growth, red blood cell formation.
* **Inositol:** Supports cellular signaling and insulin function.
* **Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B12):** Essential for nerve function, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell formation; involved in myelin synthesis.
* **Selenium Dioxide:** Antioxidant, protects against cell damage.
* **Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine):** Involved in nerve function and numerous metabolic processes.
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:**  Essential for immune function, cell growth, and wound healing.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The pharmacokinetics of this combination is complex due to the multiple components.  Absorption, metabolism, and elimination will vary for each ingredient.  For example, Alpha-lipoic acid is absorbed from the gut and metabolized in various tissues. Methylcobalamin requires intrinsic factor for absorption and is stored in the liver.  Specific details on each ingredient's pharmacokinetic profile would require individual analysis.
