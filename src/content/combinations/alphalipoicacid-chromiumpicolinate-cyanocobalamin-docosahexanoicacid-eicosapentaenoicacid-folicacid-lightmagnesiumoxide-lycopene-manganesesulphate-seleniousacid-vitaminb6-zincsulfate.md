## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed as a dietary supplement to address nutritional deficiencies in individuals who may not obtain sufficient amounts of these nutrients through diet alone. It's also used to support nerve health, cardiovascular health, and blood sugar control.  It's important to note that due to its multi-component nature, this formulation does not fall under a single pharmacological classification. Instead, its actions are derived from the combined effects of its individual components.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is often marketed as a multivitamin and mineral supplement with omega-3 fatty acids.  Some brand names include Galbex-XT and Surbex Gold. Regional and international variations may exist.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** This combination exerts its effects through the synergistic action of its components.  Alpha-lipoic acid and lycopene act as antioxidants; B vitamins support nerve function and red blood cell formation; chromium picolinate aids glucose metabolism; zinc, magnesium, manganese, and selenium contribute to overall cellular health; and omega-3 fatty acids (DHA and EPA) benefit cardiovascular health.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Each component has its own pharmacokinetic profile. Alpha-lipoic acid is readily absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 30-60 minutes. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily through the kidneys.  B vitamins are generally well-absorbed and are involved in various metabolic pathways. Chromium picolinate absorption is relatively low. The omega-3 fatty acids are incorporated into cell membranes and undergo beta-oxidation. Minerals are absorbed and utilized based on individual requirements.

**Mode of Action:** Alpha-lipoic acid regenerates other antioxidants and chelates metal ions. B vitamins function as coenzymes in various metabolic reactions. Chromium picolinate enhances insulin sensitivity. Omega-3 fatty acids modulate inflammation and improve lipid profiles. Minerals play essential roles in enzyme activity, structural integrity, and various physiological processes.


## **Dosage**

Dosage guidelines are general and should be determined in consultation with a healthcare professional considering individual patient needs and specific product formulations.

### **Standard Dosage**
