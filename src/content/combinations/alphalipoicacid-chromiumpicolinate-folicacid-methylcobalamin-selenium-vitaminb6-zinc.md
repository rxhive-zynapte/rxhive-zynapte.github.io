## **Usage**

This combination is primarily prescribed as a dietary supplement to support nerve health, glucose metabolism, and offer cellular protection due to its antioxidant properties.  It is often used in conditions like diabetic neuropathy, for promoting healthy blood sugar levels, and potentially improving insulin sensitivity. It's also prescribed for various neuropathies (diabetic, drug-induced, alcoholic), sciatica, backache, cervical syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome and migraine headaches.

It doesn't fit into a single pharmacological classification, but its components have multiple actions including vitamin, mineral supplement, antioxidant,  and neurotrophic agent.

## **Alternate Names**

There's no specific alternate name for this combination. It is usually identified by its component names. Individual components have other names, for instance Methylcobalamin is also known as Vitamin B12, Pyridoxine as Vitamin B6.  Some brand names include Macbeta and Miol-OD.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Each component contributes to the overall effect:

* **Alpha Lipoic Acid:** Acts as an antioxidant, improves nerve conduction, and may enhance glucose utilization.
* **Chromium Picolinate:** Improves insulin action, thus promoting glucose metabolism.
* **Folic Acid & Methylcobalamin:** Essential for nerve function, cell division and specifically Methylcobalamin in  myelin synthesis.
* **Selenium:** Antioxidant properties and supports thyroid function.
* **Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine):** Supports numerous metabolic processes and nerve function.
* **Zinc:** Essential for immune function and wound healing.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Absorption, metabolism, and elimination data vary for each component.  Alpha lipoic acid is readily absorbed and metabolized in the liver.  B vitamins are generally well-absorbed, with excess excreted in urine.  Minerals like zinc and selenium are absorbed and utilized through various metabolic pathways.  More detailed pharmacokinetic data for individual drugs can be consulted.

**Mode of Action:** Alpha Lipoic Acid regenerates other antioxidants and chelates metal ions, contributing to its neuroprotective effects. Methylcobalamin is a cofactor in myelin synthesis and nerve regeneration. Folic acid, Vitamin B6, and other B vitamins play roles in nerve metabolism and function.  Chromium may improve insulin signaling. Zinc and selenium are essential cofactors for various enzymes.
