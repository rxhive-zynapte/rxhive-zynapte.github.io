## **Usage**

This combination is primarily prescribed as a nutritional supplement to support nerve function, glucose metabolism, and cellular protection due to its antioxidant properties. It's often used for conditions like diabetic neuropathy, promoting healthy blood sugar levels, and improving insulin sensitivity.  It falls under the category of dietary supplements, containing vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.

The mechanism of action involves multiple pathways: Alpha-lipoic acid acts as a potent antioxidant, scavenging free radicals and regenerating other antioxidants. Chromium picolinate improves insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. Methylcobalamin, the active form of vitamin B12, is essential for nerve function and myelin synthesis. Omega-3 fatty acids exert anti-inflammatory effects, and selenium dioxide contributes to antioxidant defense.


## **Alternate Names**

There are no officially recognized alternate names for this specific combination. It's typically identified by its component ingredients. Brand names may vary depending on the manufacturer; some examples include Carvic, Carmax, and Omegabal.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Alpha-lipoic acid exerts antioxidant effects by scavenging free radicals.  Chromium picolinate potentiates insulin action, improving glucose uptake and utilization. Methylcobalamin participates in myelin synthesis and nerve regeneration. Omega-3 fatty acids, specifically EPA and DHA, reduce inflammation and improve nerve conduction. Selenium dioxide acts as a cofactor for antioxidant enzymes.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  The individual components are absorbed orally, but the combined pharmacokinetic profile isn't well established. Alpha-lipoic acid is rapidly absorbed and metabolized in the liver. Chromium picolinate absorption is influenced by dietary factors. Methylcobalamin utilizes specific transport proteins for absorption. Omega-3 fatty acids are incorporated into cell membranes and lipoproteins. Selenium dioxide is converted to selenide and incorporated into selenoproteins.

**Mode of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Alpha-lipoic acid regenerates other antioxidants (vitamins C and E) and interacts with various metabolic pathways. Chromium picolinate enhances insulin receptor signaling. Methylcobalamin acts as a coenzyme for methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Omega-3 fatty acids modulate inflammatory pathways.

**Elimination:** Alpha-lipoic acid is primarily excreted renally. Chromium is excreted mainly in urine.  Methylcobalamin undergoes enterohepatic circulation and renal excretion.  Omega-3 fatty acids are eliminated through beta-oxidation and biliary excretion. Selenium is excreted in urine and feces.
