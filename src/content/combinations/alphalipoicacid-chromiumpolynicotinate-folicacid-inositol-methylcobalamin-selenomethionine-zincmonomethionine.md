## **Usage**

This combination of ingredients is primarily used as a dietary supplement to support nerve health and function, particularly in conditions like diabetic neuropathy and alcoholic neuropathy.  It may also be prescribed for general health maintenance and to address deficiencies in these specific nutrients.  It does not fall neatly into a single pharmacological classification, but encompasses vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.

The mechanism of action involves multiple pathways:
* **Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B12):** Essential for nerve cell function, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell formation.
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid:** A potent antioxidant that protects nerve cells from damage and improves nerve conduction.
* **Folic Acid (Vitamin B9):** Involved in DNA synthesis and repair, important for nerve cell growth and function.
* **Inositol:** Plays a role in nerve signal transmission and cell membrane health.
* **Chromium Polynicotinate:** Enhances insulin action and may improve glucose metabolism, beneficial in diabetic neuropathy.
* **Selenomethionine:** An antioxidant that protects cells from damage.
* **Zinc monomethionine:** Supports nerve function and immune system health.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for this specific combination.  It is often referred to by the individual ingredient names. Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region, such as "Ox Nerve Plus," "Renerve Plus", and "Remylin Forte".


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** This combination exerts its effects through the synergistic actions of its components. Methylcobalamin is crucial for nerve myelination and function. Alpha lipoic acid acts as a potent antioxidant, scavenging free radicals and protecting nerves from oxidative stress. Folic acid plays a role in DNA synthesis and repair. Inositol is involved in cell signaling pathways and nerve transmission. Chromium improves insulin sensitivity. Selenomethionine and zinc monomethionine act as antioxidants and support overall cellular health.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Each component has its own absorption, metabolism, and elimination profile. Methylcobalamin requires intrinsic factor for absorption in the ileum. Alpha lipoic acid is absorbed in the small intestine and undergoes both renal and hepatic elimination. Folic acid is absorbed in the jejunum.  Inositol is readily absorbed and widely distributed.  Chromium, selenomethionine, and zinc monomethionine are absorbed and utilized via different pathways.

Specific receptor binding or enzyme inhibition details for this combination are not well-defined beyond the individual actions of components like methylcobalamin and chromium. Elimination pathways also vary; methylcobalamin is primarily excreted in bile, alpha lipoic acid undergoes both renal and hepatic elimination, and folic acid is excreted both renally and in bile.


## **Dosage**

Dosage recommendations can vary significantly based on the specific product formulation and the manufacturer's guidelines.  Consulting a physician is crucial for determining the appropriate dosage for individual patients.

### **Standard Dosage**
