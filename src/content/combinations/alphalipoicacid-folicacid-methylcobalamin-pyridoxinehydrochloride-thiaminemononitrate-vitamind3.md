## **Usage**

- This combination is prescribed as a nutritional supplement primarily to support nerve health, particularly in conditions like diabetic neuropathy. It is also used to address deficiencies in any of its individual components.  It can be used for conditions like neuropathic pain, anemia, homocysteinemia, cardiovascular disease risk reduction, and promoting bone health. It may also be prescribed to improve brain and nerve health, and lower homocysteine levels in the blood.
- **Pharmacological Classification**: This is a combination of vitamins and antioxidants.

## **Alternate Names**

- This combination is marketed under various brand names like ZENCOBAL D3, Dalfomin OD Tablet, Mucobal Plus Tablet, and Oramylin-D Tablet.
- Some formulations may use alternative names for ingredients, such as Vitamin B1 for Thiamine Mononitrate, Vitamin B6 for Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, and Vitamin B12 for Methylcobalamin.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: The components exert their effects through a combination of antioxidant activity, neurotransmitter synthesis support, nerve function support, and metabolic regulation. ALA neutralizes harmful free radicals and regenerates other antioxidants. Folic acid helps produce red blood cells and DNA. Methylcobalamin aids nerve function, DNA/red blood cell production, and metabolizes homocysteine. Pyridoxine converts food into energy and metabolizes fats and protein. Vitamin D3 regulates calcium absorption and supports healthy bone mineralization. Thiamine is crucial for converting food into energy, cellular growth, and nerve function.
- **Pharmacokinetics**: Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion vary among the components. B vitamins are generally water-soluble and excreted renally, while lipoic acid is metabolized and eliminated both renally and hepatically.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- One capsule or tablet daily is the typical dosage.  The dose can range from 200 to 1800 mg daily, administered orally or intravenously.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: Dosage should be carefully evaluated and adjusted based on organ function and overall health.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Dose modification may be needed for patients with kidney diseases.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Caution and dose adjustments may be needed in patients with liver disease due to altered metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Dosage should be individualized based on the specific comorbidities.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Dosage for specific medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations should be determined by the attending physician.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose modification may be needed in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, malabsorption syndrome, or other conditions affecting vitamin absorption or metabolism.
