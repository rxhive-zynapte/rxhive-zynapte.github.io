## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used to treat nutritional deficiencies, especially those related to B vitamins.  It's also prescribed for managing diabetic neuropathy pain, promoting nerve health, lowering homocysteine levels, and potentially aiding in weight management.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Multivitamin/Dietary Supplement, Antioxidant, Nerve health agent.

- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination medication works due to the synergistic effects of its components:
    - **Alpha Lipoic Acid:** Acts as a potent antioxidant, regenerating other antioxidants like Vitamins C and E.
    - **Folic Acid (Vitamin B9):** Crucial for DNA synthesis, red blood cell formation, and fetal development.  It also regulates homocysteine levels.
    - **Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B12):** Supports metabolic reactions, fatty acid synthesis, blood formation, cell growth, and nerve function.
    - **Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6):** Acts as a coenzyme in protein metabolism and contributes to neurotransmitter and red blood cell production.
    - **Thiamine Mononitrate (Vitamin B1):**  Essential for converting food into energy and supporting cell growth and function, particularly in the nervous system.

## **Alternate Names**

Some alternate names include Neurolife, Nerveguard-Plus, ABNERV-PLUS, Anicobal-OD, Meclab OD, Osem OD Capsule, and Rejunex Capsule.  These may be brand names or regional variations.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The combined effects of the vitamins and alpha-lipoic acid improve nerve function, reduce oxidative stress, and support metabolic processes.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Absorption: Each component has its own absorption profile; however, generally absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
    - Metabolism: Each component is metabolized via different pathways.
    - Elimination: Primarily renal excretion, although some components may have hepatic involvement.
- **Mode of Action:**
    - Alpha-lipoic acid: Direct antioxidant activity and regeneration of other antioxidants.
    - B Vitamins: Act as coenzymes in various metabolic pathways, including energy production, DNA synthesis, and nerve function.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Primarily coenzyme functions for the B vitamins; alpha-lipoic acid exerts antioxidant effects.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion; hepatic metabolism may play a role for certain components.
