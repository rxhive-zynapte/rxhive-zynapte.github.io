## **Usage**

- This combination is primarily prescribed for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy and nutritional deficiencies, especially those involving B vitamins and vitamin D.  It may also be used to address conditions related to elevated homocysteine levels and to support nerve health, cognitive function, and overall well-being.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination is classified as a nutritional supplement and metabolic agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination works by addressing deficiencies in essential nutrients necessary for nerve function, red blood cell production, DNA synthesis, and overall metabolic processes. Alpha-lipoic acid acts as an antioxidant, protecting nerve cells from damage. Folic acid, Methylcobalamin (B12), and Vitamin B6 are involved in homocysteine metabolism, potentially lowering cardiovascular risks. Vitamin D3 promotes calcium absorption and contributes to overall health.


## **Alternate Names** 

- There are no officially recognized alternate names for this specific combination.
- This combination is marketed under various brand names, and is often referred to by names that reflect the combined components, such as "ZENCOBAL D3" or "Elmecob D".  Many other brand names likely exist.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Alpha-lipoic acid exhibits antioxidant properties, protecting cells from oxidative stress. Folic acid and Methylcobalamin are essential for DNA synthesis, red blood cell formation, and nerve function. Vitamin B6 is a coenzyme for various metabolic processes. Vitamin D3 aids calcium absorption and bone health. Together, these components support nerve function, energy production, and overall well-being.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Alpha-lipoic acid is readily absorbed after oral administration and reaches peak plasma concentrations within 30-60 minutes. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted mainly through the kidneys.  B Vitamins are generally well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Vitamin B12 requires intrinsic factor for absorption in the ileum.  These vitamins are metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in urine.  Vitamin D3 is absorbed from the gut and undergoes hydroxylation in the liver and kidneys to its active form.  It is stored in adipose tissue and excreted in bile.
- **Mode of Action:**  Alpha-lipoic acid neutralizes free radicals and regenerates other antioxidants.  Folic acid, methylcobalamin, and pyridoxine are involved in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine, an essential amino acid. Methylcobalamin is a cofactor for methionine synthase, which catalyzes this reaction. Vitamin D3 binds to vitamin D receptors, regulating calcium and phosphorus homeostasis.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Alpha-lipoic acid is metabolized and excreted primarily renally. B vitamins are also primarily excreted in urine.  Vitamin D3 is eliminated through biliary excretion.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**  
#### **Adults:**  
- Typical dosage is one tablet or capsule daily, containing specific amounts of each component as per the formulation. However, dosages may vary depending on individual needs.

#### **Children:**
