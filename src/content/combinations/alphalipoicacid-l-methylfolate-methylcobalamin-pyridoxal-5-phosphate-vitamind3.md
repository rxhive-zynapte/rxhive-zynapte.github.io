## **Usage**

This combination of ingredients is primarily prescribed for the management of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and nutritional deficiencies, particularly those related to vitamin B deficiencies and vitamin D deficiency. It may also be used to support nerve health and function in other conditions.  This drug is classified as a vitamin and nutritional supplement.

The mechanism of action involves multiple pathways. Alpha-lipoic acid acts as a potent antioxidant, scavenging free radicals and supporting the regeneration of other antioxidants. L-methylfolate, the active form of folic acid, is crucial for DNA synthesis and cell division, particularly in nerve cells. Methylcobalamin, the active form of vitamin B12, is essential for myelin sheath formation and nerve conduction. Pyridoxal-5-phosphate, the active form of vitamin B6, plays a role in neurotransmitter synthesis and nerve function. Vitamin D3 contributes to overall nerve health and may improve neuropathic symptoms.

## **Alternate Names**

There isn't a single standardized international nonproprietary name for this combination product.  It is often referred to by its component ingredients.  Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  This combination therapy addresses peripheral neuropathy by improving nerve conduction velocity, reducing oxidative stress, and promoting nerve regeneration.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  
* **Alpha-lipoic acid:** Absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, and excreted renally.
* **L-methylfolate:** Absorbed readily and converted to tetrahydrofolic acid, the biologically active form of folate. Excreted renally.
* **Methylcobalamin:** Absorbed via passive diffusion and active transport. Stored in the liver and excreted in bile and urine.
* **Pyridoxal-5-phosphate:** Converted to pyridoxal and then to pyridoxic acid and excreted primarily in urine.
* **Vitamin D3:**  Absorbed in the small intestine, hydroxylated in the liver and kidney to its active form (calcitriol), and stored in adipose tissue. Excreted via bile and feces.


**Mode of Action:** Each component exerts distinct effects.  Alpha-lipoic acid's antioxidant activity protects nerves from oxidative damage. Methylcobalamin and pyridoxal-5-phosphate participate in nerve regeneration. L-methylfolate reduces homocysteine levels, which can contribute to nerve damage. Vitamin D3 improves calcium and phosphorus levels in nerve tissue.

## **Dosage**

Dosage regimens can vary significantly based on the specific product formulation, patient factors, and the severity of the condition being treated. Always consult the specific product's prescribing information for detailed dosage recommendations.


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  There's no universally standardized dosage for this combination product.  Dosages will be determined based on the specific product and clinical indication. It's crucial to follow the prescribed dosage and consult a healthcare professional for any adjustments.

#### **Children:**  Safety and efficacy in children have not been conclusively established. Use with caution and only under the direct supervision of a pediatrician or pediatric specialist.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary due to age-related physiological changes in renal and hepatic function.  Close monitoring is recommended.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction or more spaced out dosing might be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage modification may be required due to altered metabolism and clearance of some of the components.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful assessment and individualized dosing are essential in patients with coexisting conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or thyroid disorders.
