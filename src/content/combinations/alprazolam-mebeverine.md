## **Usage**

Alprazolam + Mebeverine is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) when it is accompanied by anxiety or panic disorders.  Mebeverine addresses the gastrointestinal symptoms of IBS, while Alprazolam targets the psychological aspects.

* **Pharmacological Classification:**
    * Mebeverine: Musculotropic antispasmodic.
    * Alprazolam: Benzodiazepine, Anxiolytic, Sedative, Hypnotic.

* **Mechanism of Action:** Mebeverine acts directly on the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract, reducing spasms and pain. Alprazolam enhances the inhibitory effect of GABA, a neurotransmitter, in the central nervous system, leading to decreased anxiety and a calming effect.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no internationally recognized non-proprietary name for the combination product.  Names will typically reflect the ingredients, such as "Alprazolam and Mebeverine."

* **Brand Names:**  Mebrin AZ, Mebaspa AL (and other regional variations).


## **How It Works**

* **Pharmacodynamics (Mebeverine):** Mebeverine is a direct smooth muscle relaxant that primarily acts on the musculature of the gastrointestinal tract. It inhibits calcium channels, reducing muscle contractions that contribute to IBS symptoms like abdominal pain and cramping. Its action is local to the gut with minimal systemic effects.

* **Pharmacodynamics (Alprazolam):**  Alprazolam binds to benzodiazepine receptors on GABA-A receptors in the brain. This enhances GABA's inhibitory effects, leading to a decrease in neuronal excitability, reducing anxiety, inducing sedation, and potentially causing hypnotic effects.

* **Pharmacokinetics (Mebeverine):** Mebeverine is metabolized by ester hydrolysis, primarily in the liver and plasma.  It has low systemic bioavailability.  Excretion is mainly via the urine.

* **Pharmacokinetics (Alprazolam):** Alprazolam is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. It undergoes hepatic metabolism primarily by CYP3A4, forming active metabolites. It is excreted mainly in the urine.


## **Dosage**

The dosage information below is specifically for the combination product Alprazolam + Mebeverine, such as Mebrin AZ, where the dosage is fixed.  Alprazolam and Mebeverine can also be prescribed separately, with independent dosing regimens.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
One tablet containing 0.25 mg Alprazolam and 135 mg Mebeverine, two to three times per day.


#### **Children:** This combination is generally not recommended for children under 18 years old due to a lack of established safety and efficacy data. Individual components may be prescribed separately, with appropriate pediatric dosing adjustments.


#### **Special Cases:**
* **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lowest dose (one tablet twice a day) and titrate cautiously based on response and tolerance.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution is advised. Dose adjustment may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, particularly with Alprazolam, which is metabolized by the liver.  Start with a lower dose and monitor closely. 
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration is required for patients with respiratory depression, glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, or a history of substance abuse.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of Alprazolam + Mebeverine is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgery, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU. These situations may require separate administration of specific medications tailored to the individual patient's needs.  Alprazolam may be used in emergency situations to manage acute anxiety or panic attacks.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments should be individualized based on patient response, tolerability, and the presence of renal or hepatic impairment.  Slower titration is recommended in elderly patients.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Headache


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
* Paradoxical reactions (increased anxiety, agitation, aggression)
* Respiratory depression
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)


### **Long-Term Effects:**
* Dependence (Alprazolam)
* Cognitive impairment (Alprazolam)


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
* Angioedema
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to Alprazolam, Mebeverine, or benzodiazepines
* Narrow-angle glaucoma
* Paralytic ileus
* Severe respiratory depression
* Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole)



## **Drug Interactions**
* CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, opioids, other benzodiazepines): Additive sedative effects.
* CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, grapefruit juice): Increased Alprazolam levels.
* CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin): Decreased Alprazolam levels.
* Muscle relaxants (baclofen): Increased muscle relaxation.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
* **Pregnancy:** Alprazolam is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of fetal harm. Mebeverine use during pregnancy is generally not recommended.
* **Breastfeeding:** Alprazolam and its metabolites are excreted in breast milk.  Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking Alprazolam.  Mebeverine's effects on breastfeeding are not well-established, and caution is advised.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Mebeverine: Direct smooth muscle relaxant. Alprazolam: GABAergic anxiolytic.
* **Side Effects:**  Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, narrow-angle glaucoma, paralytic ileus, concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.
* **Drug Interactions:** CNS depressants, CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Generally avoided.
* **Dosage:** Adults: Alprazolam 0.25 mg + Mebeverine 135 mg, 2-3 times daily. Not recommended for children.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for sedation, respiratory depression, and paradoxical reactions.


## **Popular Combinations**

Alprazolam + Mebeverine is itself a combination used for managing IBS with anxiety.  It may be used alongside other IBS-specific medications as needed, like antidiarrheals or laxatives, but under close supervision.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess for concurrent medical conditions, allergies, and potential drug interactions.
* **Specific Populations:**  Caution in elderly patients and those with renal or hepatic impairment. Avoid in pregnancy and exercise caution during breastfeeding. Not recommended for children.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants. Caution when operating machinery or driving.
