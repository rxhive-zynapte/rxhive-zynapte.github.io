## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the relief of symptoms associated with excess stomach acid, such as heartburn, acid indigestion, sour stomach, and upset stomach. It also helps relieve the symptoms of gas, including bloating and pressure.  It falls under the pharmacological classification of **antacids** and **antiflatulents**.

The antacids (aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide) work by neutralizing stomach acid, while simethicone helps break down gas bubbles in the digestive tract, and carboxymethylcellulose sodium works as a thickener and helps prolong contact between the medication and the esophageal lining.

## **Alternate Names**

While the generic name clearly lists its components, there are no widely recognized alternate generic names. This combination is marketed under various brand names, which include Mylanta.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide neutralize gastric acid by reacting with hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the stomach to form aluminum chloride, magnesium chloride, and water. This raises the gastric pH, relieving the discomfort associated with acidity. Simethicone reduces the surface tension of gas bubbles in the stomach and intestines, allowing them to coalesce, making it easier to expel gas.  Carboxymethylcellulose acts as a suspending agent and may provide a protective barrier on the esophageal lining.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide are not significantly absorbed systemically, so their effects are primarily local within the gastrointestinal tract.  Simethicone is also not absorbed and is eliminated unchanged in the feces.  Carboxymethylcellulose sodium is not absorbed into the bloodstream and is excreted through feces.

**Mode of Action:**  The antacids directly neutralize existing HCl.  Simethicone doesn't prevent gas formation but facilitates its elimination.  Carboxymethylcellulose acts as a physical agent by helping maintain a uniform suspension and increasing viscosity, potentially promoting mucosal adherence.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** This combination does not have any specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation activity. It works primarily through chemical neutralization (antacids) and physical alteration of gas bubbles (simethicone).

**Elimination Pathways:** The components are primarily eliminated through fecal excretion.  A small amount of aluminum and magnesium may be absorbed and renally excreted.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  10-20 mL or 2-4 chewable tablets orally every 4-6 hours as needed, taken 1 hour before or 3 hours after meals and at bedtime. Do not exceed 12 tablets or 60 mL within a 24-hour period. Do not use the maximum dosage for more than two weeks, except under the advice and supervision of a physician.

#### **Children:** Consult a doctor before administering to children under 12 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Monitor for potential constipation and adjust dose if needed. Consider kidney function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dose adjustment may be necessary based on the degree of renal impairment. Aluminum and magnesium accumulation can occur in patients with significant renal dysfunction.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustment is typically required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or electrolyte imbalances due to potential for sodium and magnesium accumulation.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its primary use is for symptomatic relief of gastrointestinal discomfort related to excess acid and gas.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based primarily on renal function and response to therapy.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
Constipation (aluminum hydroxide), diarrhea (magnesium hydroxide), loss of appetite, weakness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), severe constipation, muscle weakness, irregular heartbeat.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential for electrolyte imbalances (hypophosphatemia, hypermagnesemia) with prolonged use, particularly in patients with renal impairment.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), metabolic alkalosis, bowel obstruction.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any components, severe renal impairment, bowel obstruction.



## **Drug Interactions**

Antacids can affect the absorption of many medications, including tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, iron supplements, levothyroxine, and bisphosphonates. Separate administration by at least 2 hours is usually recommended.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Generally considered safe for occasional use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  However, prolonged use should be avoided. Consult a physician for appropriate guidance.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

## **Popular Combinations**

Not typically combined with other drugs for synergistic effects. Primarily used as a stand-alone symptomatic treatment.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Evaluate renal function in patients with kidney disease. Monitor for electrolyte imbalances with prolonged use.
- **Specific Populations:** Use with caution in pregnant and breastfeeding women, and in children under 12.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** May be appropriate to recommend dietary changes to manage symptoms of heartburn and indigestion.
