## **Usage**

This combination is used for active immunization against infection caused by all known subtypes of the Hepatitis B virus.  Since Hepatitis D requires Hepatitis B infection to occur, vaccination against Hepatitis B is also preventative for Hepatitis D. Though sources mention thiomersal, one source states that current formulations may be thiomersal-free.

**Pharmacological classification:** Vaccine

**Mechanism of Action:**  The hepatitis B vaccine introduces a purified, non-infectious surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus (HBsAg).  This stimulates the body's immune system to produce antibodies against HBsAg, providing immunity against future infection with the actual virus.  Aluminium hydroxide acts as an adjuvant, enhancing the immune response to the vaccine. Thiomersal, where present, is used as a preservative to prevent bacterial or fungal contamination.

## **Alternate Names**

Hepatitis B vaccine (rDNA) BP
Hepa-B
GeneVac-B

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The vaccine mimics a natural hepatitis B infection, triggering the body's humoral immune response without causing the disease. This leads to the production of specific antibodies against the hepatitis B surface antigen, conferring immunity.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The vaccine is administered intramuscularly. The HBsAg is adsorbed onto aluminium hydroxide, creating a depot at the injection site that releases the antigen gradually. This sustained release prolongs antigen exposure, maximizing immune stimulation.  The antigen itself is processed by antigen-presenting cells and presented to lymphocytes, triggering the adaptive immune response.  The pharmacokinetics of thiomersal, a mercury-containing compound, are not relevant to the vaccine's efficacy, but are important to consider regarding safety concerns in some populations. It can be metabolized to ethylmercury and excreted in the urine.  Aluminium hydroxide is not readily absorbed and does not typically have systemic effects.

**Mode of Action:** The hepatitis B vaccine utilizes the humoral arm of the adaptive immune system. The HBsAg activates B cells, leading to the production of antigen-specific antibodies.  These antibodies circulate and bind to HBsAg, neutralizing the actual hepatitis B virus upon subsequent exposure, preventing infection.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** The hepatitis B vaccine does not have any direct effect on receptors, enzymes, or neurotransmitters.  Its action is entirely through the stimulation of the adaptive immune response.

**Elimination Pathways:** Aluminium hydroxide is minimally absorbed from the injection site. It is gradually eliminated through the reticuloendothelial system. As the body's adaptive immune response is stimulated, it would create memory B cells that would trigger antibody creation if presented with the actual Hepatitis B virus.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* 20 mcg (1.0 mL) intramuscularly at 0, 1, and 6 months, or 0, 1, and 2 months (for rapid protection).

#### **Children (Neonates, Infants, Children, and Adolescents up to 19 Years of Age):**

* 10 mcg (0.5 mL) intramuscularly at 6, 10, and 14 weeks for infants or 0, 1, and 6 months.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Same as adult dosing.  Immunogenicity may be reduced in this population.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No dosage adjustment is generally required.  However, close monitoring of antibody response is recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Dosage adjustments may be needed based on the specific comorbidity.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The Hepatitis B vaccine is for prophylactic use, not for the treatment of acute conditions like those listed below.  It is not typically given in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific dosage adjustments are typically needed for renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Pain, swelling, and redness at the injection site
* Mild fever
* Headache
* Fatigue

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis)
* Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) (extremely rare)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

No long-term adverse effects associated with the hepatitis B vaccine have been identified.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Anaphylaxis is a rare but serious ADR requiring immediate medical intervention.

## **Contraindications**

* Severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of hepatitis B vaccine or any component of the vaccine (including yeast, thiomersal if present)

## **Drug Interactions**

* Immunosuppressants may reduce the immune response to the vaccine.
* Concomitant administration with other vaccines is generally safe, although separate injection sites should be used.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The hepatitis B vaccine is considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It is not known to pose a risk to the fetus or the nursing infant.  However, the potential benefits of vaccination should outweigh the potential risks in each individual case.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigen.
* **Side Effects:** Injection site reactions, fever, headache, fatigue. Rarely, allergic reactions or GBS.
* **Contraindications:**  Hypersensitivity to vaccine components.
* **Drug Interactions:** Immunosuppressants.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 20 mcg at 0, 1, and 6 months (or 0, 1, and 2 months for rapid protection). Children: 10 mcg at 6, 10, and 14 weeks for infants or 0, 1, and 6 months.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Antibody titers post-vaccination may be checked in certain populations to assess response.


## **Popular Combinations**

The hepatitis B vaccine is often given in combination with other childhood vaccines, such as DTaP, IPV, Hib, and MMR.


## **Precautions**

* Standard precautions for administering intramuscular injections should be followed.
* Patients should be observed for signs of allergic reactions after vaccination.
