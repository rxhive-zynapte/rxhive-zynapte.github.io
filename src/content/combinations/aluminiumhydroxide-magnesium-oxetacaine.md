## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of gastrointestinal disorders associated with hyperacidity, such as:

*   Gastritis
*   Esophagitis
*   Peptic ulcers (gastric and duodenal)
*   Hiatal hernia
*   Heartburn (including during pregnancy)
*   Indigestion
*   Stomach upset

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This is a combination product containing:

*   **Aluminium hydroxide and Magnesium hydroxide:** Antacids
*   **Oxetacaine:** Local anesthetic

**Mechanism of Action:**

Aluminium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide neutralize excess stomach acid, thus increasing gastric pH and reducing irritation to the gastrointestinal mucosa. Oxetacaine provides local anesthetic action, numbing the affected area and offering relief from pain associated with ulcers or acid injury in the stomach.

## **Alternate Names**

While no specific international nonproprietary name exists for this combination, it may be referred to as a combination antacid with local anesthetic. 

Several brand names exist depending on the region and manufacturer. These include:

*  Mucaine gel
*  Kascito-O gel
*  Gastrocam
*  Ancool
*  Allugel
*  Geltazine

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

Aluminium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide chemically react with gastric acid (HCl) to form neutral salts and water, thereby increasing intragastric pH. Oxetacaine inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels in neuronal membranes, resulting in a localized anesthetic effect.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:**  Oxetacaine is absorbed systemically when administered alone, but its absorption is reduced when combined with aluminum and magnesium hydroxide. Aluminum and magnesium hydroxide are poorly absorbed systemically.
*   **Metabolism:**  Oxetacaine is metabolized in the liver.
*   **Elimination:**  Oxetacaine is primarily excreted in the urine.  Aluminum and magnesium are primarily excreted in the feces.  Patients with renal impairment may experience aluminum and magnesium accumulation.

**Mode of Action:**

Aluminum and magnesium hydroxide work through chemical neutralization.  Oxetacaine blocks sodium channels, preventing depolarization of nerve fibers and inhibiting pain signal transmission.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, Neurotransmitter Modulation:**

This combination does not involve receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation.

**Elimination Pathways:**

*   Aluminum and magnesium are primarily eliminated through fecal excretion.
*   Oxetacaine is metabolized in the liver and excreted via the kidneys.


## **Dosage**

Dosage guidelines are general and should be individualized based on patient needs. Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard dose is typically 10-20 mL or 1-2 tablets, taken 20 minutes to 1 hour after meals and at bedtime, as needed.  The daily maximum dose is generally 80 mL or the equivalent in tablets.

#### **Children:**

This medication is generally NOT recommended for children under 12 years old. Safety and efficacy in this age group have not been fully established. For children above 12, a lower dose is recommended under strict medical supervision.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to potential for altered drug handling and comorbidities. Careful monitoring is required.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with extreme caution due to reduced aluminum and magnesium clearance. Dose adjustments are necessary, and close monitoring of serum levels is advised.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** As oxetacaine is metabolized in the liver, use cautiously and adjust dose as needed in patients with hepatic impairment.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Careful consideration is needed for patients with conditions like diabetes, heart failure, and other metabolic disorders. Consult specialists accordingly.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This drug combination is not typically used for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or in the ICU or emergency situations.  Its primary role is symptomatic relief in outpatient settings for the above-mentioned gastrointestinal conditions.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are essential based on patient-specific factors such as renal function, hepatic function, age, and other comorbidities.  Close monitoring and individualized therapy are critical.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Constipation
*   Diarrhea
*   Nausea
*   Drowsiness
*   Dizziness

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
*   Hypomotility of bowel leading to obstruction or ileus (especially in the elderly and those with renal impairment)
*   Hypermagnesemia (particularly in children with renal impairment or dehydration)
*   Hyperaluminemia

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term, high-dose use, particularly in patients with renal impairment, has been associated with dementia and microcytic anemia.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Clinically significant ADRs include allergic reactions and signs of hypermagnesemia or hyperaluminemia, requiring immediate intervention.


## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients
*   Severe renal impairment
*   Hypophosphatemia
*   Severe abdominal pain with potential bowel obstruction
*   Debilitated patients

## **Drug Interactions**

This combination may interact with various medications, including:

*   Tetracycline antibiotics
*   Quinolone antibiotics (e.g., ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin)
*   Digoxin
*   Iron supplements
*   Aspirin
*   Certain anti-diabetic medications
*   Vitamins (e.g., ascorbic acid, cholecalciferol)
*   Citrates (can lead to increased aluminum absorption)
* Alcohol (can increase stomach acid production)

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

*   **Pregnancy:** Use cautiously during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. Consult a physician before use.
*   **Breastfeeding:**  Minimal amounts of aluminum and magnesium hydroxide and no simethicone (when included in some formulations) are excreted in breast milk. It is generally considered safe during breastfeeding when used as directed, but consultation with a physician is recommended.
