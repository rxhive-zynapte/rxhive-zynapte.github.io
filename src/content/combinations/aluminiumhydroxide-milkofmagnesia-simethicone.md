## **Usage**

- This combination medication is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of gastrointestinal discomfort associated with hyperacidity, peptic ulcer, duodenal ulcer, dyspepsia, heartburn, gastritis, hiatal hernia, and gaseous distension. It is also used to treat symptoms like acid indigestion, acid reflux, and flatulence.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antacid, antiflatulent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This drug works through a combination of actions. Aluminium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide neutralize excess stomach acid, providing relief from heartburn and acid indigestion. Simethicone is an antiflatulent that works by reducing the surface tension of gas bubbles in the stomach and intestines, allowing them to coalesce and be expelled more easily.

## **Alternate Names**

- Alumina, magnesia, and simethicone
- Aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide/simethicone
- **Brand Names:** Gelusil, Antagit DS

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Aluminium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide react with gastric acid to form aluminum chloride and magnesium chloride, respectively, along with water. This chemical reaction neutralizes excess stomach acid, increasing gastric pH. Simethicone disperses and prevents the formation of mucus-surrounded gas pockets in the gastrointestinal tract, facilitating their expulsion.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Aluminium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide are poorly absorbed systemically. Simethicone is not absorbed and is eliminated unchanged in the feces.

- **Mode of Action:**  Neutralization of gastric acid; defoaming action of simethicone on gas bubbles.

- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** This combination product does not directly interact with any specific receptors, inhibit enzymes, or modulate neurotransmitters. Its primary action is physicochemical.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily via fecal excretion. A small amount of aluminum and magnesium may be absorbed and renally excreted.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Liquid: 10-20 mL (or 30 mL unit dose) orally every 4-6 hours as needed, taken 1 hour before or 3 hours after meals. Do not exceed 120 mL in a 24-hour period or use the maximum dose for more than 2 weeks.
- Chewable Tablets: 2-4 tablets every 4-6 hours; not to exceed 12 tablets/24 hours.

#### **Children:**

- Children under 12 years: Maximum of 5 mL (one medicine measure) three times a day.
- Adolescents (12-18 years): 5-20 mL (one to four medicine measures) every three hours daily as needed. Do not exceed 120 mL total daily dose.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary based on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Magnesium accumulation may occur.  Dosage adjustment is essential.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustment is usually required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient factors and adjust dosage as needed.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  Dosage in these specific medical settings is similar to standard adult recommendations and should be adjusted based on the patient's clinical status and renal function.

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations**


### **Dosage Adjustments**  Individualized dose titration is crucial in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, considering drug clearance and potential for adverse effects.



## **Side Effects**
