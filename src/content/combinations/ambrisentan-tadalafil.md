## **Usage**

- Ambrisentan + Tadalafil is prescribed for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group 1) in adults. This combination therapy aims to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening of PAH. It is also used to reduce the risks of disease progression and hospitalization for worsening PAH.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination includes two drug classes:
    * Ambrisentan: Endothelin Receptor Antagonist (specifically, endothelin type-A receptor antagonist)
    * Tadalafil: Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) Inhibitor
- **Mechanism of Action:**
    * Ambrisentan blocks the effects of endothelin, a peptide that causes blood vessel constriction. By blocking endothelin receptors, ambrisentan helps relax and widen the pulmonary arteries, reducing blood pressure in the lungs.
    * Tadalafil inhibits PDE-5, an enzyme that breaks down cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Increased cGMP levels lead to smooth muscle relaxation in the pulmonary arteries, further enhancing vasodilation and improving blood flow. The combined effect of these two mechanisms leads to better outcomes in PAH.

## **Alternate Names**

- This combination does not have an International Nonproprietary Name (INN).  It is generally referred to as the combination of ambrisentan and tadalafil.
- **Brand Names:**  The combination is available under various brand names such as Pulmonext Kit and Endobloc T Kit. Letairis is the brand name for ambrisentan alone, and Adcirca or Cialis are brand names for tadalafil.  Note: Letairis is subject to a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program in some regions due to the risk of serious birth defects.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Ambrisentan and tadalafil have synergistic effects on pulmonary hemodynamics.  Ambrisentan counteracts the vasoconstricting effects of endothelin, while tadalafil enhances vasodilation through its effect on cGMP. Together, they reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and improve cardiac output, ultimately improving exercise capacity and delaying clinical worsening in PAH patients.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    * **Ambrisentan:**  Well-absorbed orally. Primarily metabolized in the liver through glucuronidation and oxidation. Excreted mainly in bile and feces, with minimal renal excretion.
    * **Tadalafil:**  Readily absorbed after oral administration. Metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 enzyme in the liver. Excreted in urine and feces.
- **Mode of Action:**
    * Ambrisentan: Competitively binds to endothelin type-A receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells, preventing endothelin-mediated vasoconstriction.
    * Tadalafil: Inhibits PDE-5, leading to increased cGMP levels, which activates protein kinase G, ultimately causing vascular smooth muscle relaxation.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**
    * Ambrisentan: Endothelin type-A receptor antagonist.
    * Tadalafil: PDE-5 inhibitor.
- **Elimination Pathways:**
    * Ambrisentan: Predominantly biliary/fecal excretion.
    * Tadalafil:  Primarily hepatic metabolism (CYP3A4), followed by renal and fecal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of ambrisentan and tadalafil is specifically indicated for pulmonary arterial hypertension and is not typically used in the clinical scenarios listed (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, emergency situations).  Other medications may be more appropriate for these situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Hepatotoxicity (liver damage), including rare cases of cirrhosis with prolonged use. Signs of liver problems may include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fever, achiness, jaundice, dark urine, and itching.
- Acute pulmonary edema, especially during treatment initiation. This may indicate underlying pulmonary veno-occlusive disease.

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Chronic liver damage with prolonged use.
- Decreased sperm count.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Angioedema (severe swelling), hypersensitivity reactions, significant liver enzyme elevations.


## **Contraindications**

- Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)
- Severe hepatic impairment.
- Hypersensitivity to ambrisentan or tadalafil.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) may increase ambrisentan exposure.
- Cyclosporine: Limit ambrisentan dose to 5 mg/day.
- Other PAH medications:  Use in combination with other endothelin receptor antagonists or PDE-5 inhibitors should be carefully considered.
- Alcohol:  May increase the risk of hypotension with tadalafil.
- Grapefruit juice: May increase tadalafil blood levels.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
