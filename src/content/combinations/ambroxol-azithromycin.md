## **Usage**

Ambroxol + Azithromycin is prescribed for lower respiratory tract infections such as acute and chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, and acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) where both thick mucus secretion and bacterial infection are present.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

*   Azithromycin: Macrolide antibiotic
*   Ambroxol: Mucolytic expectorant

**Mechanism of Action:**

Azithromycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit, thereby suppressing bacterial growth and replication. Ambroxol breaks down the structure of mucus, reducing its viscosity and making it easier to expel by coughing.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no officially recognized alternate names for the combination drug itself. The individual components, however, are known by their generic names (azithromycin and ambroxol hydrochloride) as well as various brand names.

**Brand Names:**

Some examples include Azro-AM, Laz-AX, and Zathrin-AX, although brand names can vary regionally.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

Azithromycin exerts its antibacterial effect intracellularly, accumulating in high concentrations within phagocytic cells, which transport it to the site of infection. Ambroxol stimulates surfactant production in the lungs and promotes ciliary activity, enhancing mucus clearance.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Azithromycin is well-absorbed orally but reduced by food. Ambroxol is also well-absorbed orally.
*   **Metabolism:** Azithromycin undergoes some hepatic metabolism. Ambroxol is extensively metabolized in the liver.
*   **Elimination:** Azithromycin is excreted primarily in bile, with a small amount in urine. Ambroxol is eliminated primarily in urine, both as metabolites and unchanged drug.

**Mode of Action:**

Azithromycin binds to the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit, inhibiting protein synthesis. Ambroxol alters the structure and composition of mucus glycoproteins, reducing viscosity.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**

Azithromycin targets bacterial ribosomes. Ambroxol does not have specific receptor binding or direct enzyme inhibition related to its mucolytic effect.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Azithromycin 500 mg once daily for 3 days or 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg daily for 4 days, in conjunction with Ambroxol as prescribed (typically 30 mg two to three times daily).

#### **Children:**

Dosing is determined by the child's weight and age, following pediatric guidelines, and should be initiated under medical supervision.  Ambroxol dosing is typically 7.5 mg twice daily for children aged 2-6 years, and 15 mg twice daily for children aged 7-12 years.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Generally, no dose adjustment is required for azithromycin unless significant hepatic or renal impairment is present. Ambroxol may necessitate dose adjustments in cases of severe renal impairment.

*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is required with azithromycin in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR <10 mL/min). Ambroxol dosage should be reduced.

*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Azithromycin dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Ambroxol requires careful monitoring.

*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with cardiac arrhythmias or QT prolongation risk.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific clinical settings (intubation, surgery, mechanical ventilation, ICU, emergencies) should be determined based on patient-specific factors and the severity of the infection.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are needed for hepatic/renal dysfunction, drug interactions, and certain comorbidities.



## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, rash, dizziness, headache.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Anaphylaxis, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hepatotoxicity, hearing loss, cardiac arrhythmias (QT prolongation).

### **Long-Term Effects**

Antibiotic-associated colitis, potential for development of bacterial resistance.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, hepatic dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias.





## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to azithromycin, ambroxol, or other macrolides. Pre-existing liver disease or severe renal impairment.


## **Drug Interactions**

Azithromycin may interact with antacids, warfarin, digoxin, and drugs affecting QT interval. Ambroxol may interact with certain cough suppressants. Consult a comprehensive drug interaction database for detailed information.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Azithromycin: Limited data; use only if clearly needed.  Ambroxol: Avoid, especially during the first trimester. Consult current guidelines for updated recommendations.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** Azithromycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. Ambroxol reduces mucus viscosity.

*   **Side Effects:** See above.

*   **Contraindications:** See above.

*   **Drug Interactions:** See above.

*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Azithromycin: Limited data; Ambroxol: Avoid.

*   **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests, ECG (in high-risk patients), clinical response.


## **Popular Combinations**

While this information is specifically for Ambroxol+Azithromycin combination, other common drug combinations for respiratory infections may include corticosteroids and bronchodilators, depending on the specific clinical context.


## **Precautions**

Evaluate hepatic/renal function, cardiac history (QT prolongation risk). Screen for drug allergies.  In pregnant/breastfeeding women, weigh the potential benefits against risks.
