## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for respiratory conditions characterized by mucus buildup, bronchospasm, and allergic components.  These conditions include acute or chronic bronchitis, bronchial asthma, and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.  It is also used to treat cough associated with infections in the airways, shortness of breath, and lung infections, often accompanied by chest tightness, spasms, mucous build-up, wheezing, and difficulty expelling the cough.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination drug belonging to multiple classes:

* **Mucolytics:** Ambroxol and Bromhexine
* **Antihistamine:** Cetirizine
* **Bronchodilator:** Terbutaline

**Mechanism of Action:**  This combination works through multiple pathways:
* **Ambroxol and Bromhexine:** Reduce mucus viscosity by disrupting disulfide bonds in mucoproteins, facilitating expectoration.
* **Cetirizine:** Antagonizes H1 receptors, mitigating histamine-mediated bronchoconstriction and inflammation.
* **Terbutaline:** Acts as a beta-2 adrenergic agonist, relaxing bronchial smooth muscle and promoting bronchodilation.


## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication doesn't have a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN). It is usually prescribed using the generic names of its components.

**Brand Names:** Ambropil BR Syrup, Ambropil BR Sugar Free Syrup.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Ambroxol and Bromhexine:** Decrease mucus viscosity and promote mucociliary clearance.
* **Cetirizine:** Reduces allergic inflammation and histamine-mediated bronchospasm.
* **Terbutaline:** Relaxes bronchial smooth muscle, leading to bronchodilation and improved airflow.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** All components are absorbed orally.  Ambroxol and bromhexine have good oral bioavailability. Cetirizine is well-absorbed, and terbutaline is absorbed, but with some first-pass metabolism.
* **Metabolism:**  Primarily hepatic metabolism for all components.
* **Elimination:**  Mainly renal excretion for all components.


**Mode of Action:**  

* **Ambroxol & Bromhexine:**  Break down mucopolysaccharides, reducing sputum viscosity.
* **Cetirizine:** Competitively inhibits histamine binding at H1 receptors.
* **Terbutaline:** Stimulates beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the lungs, leading to smooth muscle relaxation.

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**

* Cetirizine: H1 receptor antagonist.
* Terbutaline: Beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist.


**Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for all components.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Refer to individual component dosages. A typical regimen might include Ambroxol 30mg thrice daily, Bromhexine 8-16mg thrice daily, Cetirizine 10mg once daily, and Terbutaline 2.5-5mg thrice daily. Maximum daily doses should be carefully considered.  10-20 ml thrice daily.

#### **Children:** Pediatric dosing is weight-based or age-based.  Children (6-12 years): 10 ml thrice daily. Children (under 6 years): 5-10 ml thrice daily. Children up to 2 years: half a teaspoonful of syrup twice daily; Kids 2 to 5 years of age: half a teaspoon of syrup three times a day. Children 5 years and older: one teaspoon of syrup 2-3 times a day.  Use cautiously in children under 6 years. Consult a physician before giving to children below 6 years. Pediatric use requires close monitoring for potential side effects.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Reduce dose and monitor closely due to potential age-related organ dysfunction.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with heart, liver, kidney diseases, seizures, stomach ulcers, high blood pressure, thyroid disorders, diabetes, airway inflammation, lung disorders, and breathing difficulties.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations should be determined on a case-by-case basis and guided by individual patient needs and clinical judgment.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be necessary based on renal/hepatic function, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Headache, dryness in mouth, upset stomach, tremors, increased heart rate, palpitations, muscle cramps, tiredness, dizziness, sleepiness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Severe allergic reactions (rash, itching/swelling, severe dizziness, trouble breathing), paradoxical bronchospasm (sudden wheezing), seizures, chest pain, fast/pounding/irregular heartbeat, muscle weakness.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic complications from prolonged use are not well-documented, but continuous monitoring is advised.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Any severe or persistent side effects should be considered a potential ADR and require appropriate medical intervention.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any component, concurrent or recent (within 14 days) use of MAO inhibitors, tachyarrhythmia, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, hyperthyroidism.  Gastric ulceration and other gastrointestinal disorders.


## **Drug Interactions**

MAO inhibitors, beta-blockers, certain antibiotics, antihypertensive medications (e.g., atenolol, lisinopril), sedatives, CNS depressants (e.g., diazepam), other decongestants (e.g., pseudoephedrine, oxymetazoline), anticholinergic medications (e.g., ipratropium, tiotropium), anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, heparin),  hormones (epinephrine, oxytocin), heart medications (digoxin), Parkinson's disease medications (safinamide, rasagiline), antiemetics (ondansetron, promethazine), corticosteroids (budesonide), other respiratory medications (xanthines, aminophylline, formoterol), diuretics (furosemide), antidepressants.  Alcohol can exacerbate side effects like dizziness.
