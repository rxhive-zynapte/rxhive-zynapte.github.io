## **Usage**

Ambroxol + Cefixime + Lactobacillus is prescribed for bacterial respiratory tract infections, especially those with thick mucus production like bronchitis, pneumonia, and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. It is also used for other bacterial infections like otitis media, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, and urinary tract infections where Cefixime is indicated. The addition of Lactobacillus aims to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Ambroxol: Mucolytic, expectorant
* Cefixime: Third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic
* Lactobacillus: Probiotic

**Mechanism of Action:**

This combination drug works through the synergistic actions of its components. Ambroxol reduces mucus viscosity by breaking down mucopolysaccharides. Cefixime inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death. Lactobacillus replenishes the gut's normal flora, which can be disrupted by antibiotic use.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination doesn't have a universally recognized international non-proprietary name. It's identified by its components. Brand names include: Bactilem AX, Ceftas AL, Cembol, Wanixim AZ, and Xceft AX.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ambroxol decreases mucus viscosity, facilitating expectoration. Cefixime is bactericidal, inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins. Lactobacillus helps restore the gut flora.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Ambroxol:** Well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, excreted primarily in the urine.
* **Cefixime:** Orally absorbed (food reduces absorption rate), excreted primarily by the kidneys.
* **Lactobacillus:** Not systemically absorbed, exerts its effect within the gastrointestinal tract.

**Mode of Action:**  Cefixime inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, while Ambroxol acts as a mucolytic and mucokinetic agent. Lactobacillus helps restore the balance of intestinal flora.

**Elimination Pathways:** Ambroxol and Cefixime are primarily eliminated renally.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One tablet/capsule twice daily. The specific strengths of each ingredient and treatment duration depend on the infection's severity and type, determined by the physician. The maximum Cefixime dose is generally 400 mg daily.

#### **Children:**

Dosage is weight-based. The usual pediatric dose of Cefixime is 8 mg/kg orally once daily or 4 mg/kg every 12 hours, with adjustments based on weight. For children above 45 kg, the adult dose might be appropriate. Specific recommendations for Ambroxol in children vary by age: 2 to <6 years: 7.5-15 mg 3 times daily; 6-12 years: 15-30 mg 2-3 times daily; >12 years:  adult dose. Safety and efficacy in children under 6 months for Cefixime and under 2 years for Ambroxol have not been fully established.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustment might be necessary based on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Cefixime dosage must be adjusted based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised; dosage adjustments may be needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in clinical settings (intubation, surgery, mechanical ventilation, ICU, emergencies) is determined by the physician, considering patient-specific factors and potential drug interactions.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modification is based on renal/hepatic function, metabolic disorders, drug interactions, and genetic polymorphisms.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, indigestion, flatulence, headache, dizziness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema), *Clostridium difficile* infection, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hepatotoxicity, seizures (Cefixime), blood dyscrasias.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Altered gut microbiota with prolonged antibiotic use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, *C. difficile* infection, hepatotoxicity, blood dyscrasias.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any component (including cephalosporins), severe renal impairment.

## **Drug Interactions**

Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, increased bleeding risk), probenecid (increased Cefixime levels), antacids (reduced Cefixime absorption), other antibiotics (especially affecting respiratory or gastrointestinal systems), alcohol.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Cefixime is generally considered safe during pregnancy. Ambroxol should be avoided, especially during the first trimester. Consult a physician. Small amounts of both drugs may be present in breast milk.  Consult a physician.

## **Drug Profile Summary**
