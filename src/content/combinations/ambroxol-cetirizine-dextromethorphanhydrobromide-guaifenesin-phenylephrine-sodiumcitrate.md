## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the relief of symptoms associated with the common cold, cough, and allergies, such as cough (dry or productive), runny nose, sneezing, nasal congestion, and chest congestion.  It is specifically useful in cases of cough with mucus.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination includes several drug classes: mucolytic (ambroxol), antihistamine (cetirizine), cough suppressant (dextromethorphan), expectorant (guaifenesin), decongestant (phenylephrine), and alkalinizing agent (sodium citrate).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Briefly, ambroxol breaks down mucus, cetirizine blocks histamine action, dextromethorphan suppresses the cough reflex, guaifenesin loosens mucus, phenylephrine reduces nasal congestion, and sodium citrate helps alkalinize the respiratory secretions.


## **Alternate Names**
- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific six-ingredient combination. However, it's crucial to note that different pharmaceutical companies market this combination under various brand names.
- **Brand Names:** While sources list brand names for other combinations, they do not list a specific brand name for this 6-ingredient combination. Brand names vary regionally.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ambroxol stimulates the serous glands in the respiratory tract to produce less viscous secretions. Cetirizine antagonizes the H1 histamine receptor, reducing allergic symptoms. Dextromethorphan acts centrally on the cough center in the medulla. Guaifenesin increases respiratory tract fluid, reducing mucus viscosity. Phenylephrine acts as an α1-adrenergic receptor agonist, causing vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa. Sodium citrate acts as an alkalinizing agent.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  All components are absorbed orally. Ambroxol is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine. Cetirizine undergoes minimal metabolism and is excreted mostly unchanged in urine. Dextromethorphan is metabolized in the liver, and metabolites are excreted in urine. Guaifenesin is also metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine.  Phenylephrine undergoes first-pass metabolism and is excreted in urine. Sodium citrate is metabolized and excreted as carbon dioxide and sodium bicarbonate.
- **Mode of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Ambroxol's precise mode of action beyond stimulating serous glands is not fully elucidated. Cetirizine is an H1 receptor antagonist. Dextromethorphan acts on sigma opioid receptors and NMDA receptors in the CNS. Guaifenesin might stimulate gastric vagal receptors. Phenylephrine activates α1-adrenergic receptors. Sodium citrate alkalinizes bodily fluids, including respiratory secretions.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for all components, with varying degrees of hepatic metabolism.  


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**
#### **Adults:**
- 5 to 10 ml of syrup three times daily.
