## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the relief of symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, and other upper respiratory tract infections. These symptoms include cough (both dry and productive), nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, itchy or watery eyes, and throat irritation.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This combination includes drugs from multiple classifications:

* **Ambroxol:** Mucolytic, expectorant
* **Cetirizine:** Antihistamine
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Cough suppressant (antitussive)
* **Phenylephrine:** Decongestant (sympathomimetic)


**Mechanism of Action:**

* **Ambroxol:** Reduces the viscosity of mucus by breaking down mucopolysaccharide fibers, making it easier to cough up.
* **Cetirizine:**  Blocks the action of histamine, a chemical mediator responsible for allergic symptoms.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Suppresses the cough reflex by acting on the cough center in the brain.
* **Phenylephrine:** Constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.


## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication does not have a universally recognized international non-proprietary name (INN).  It is often referred to by the names of its constituent drugs.  A variety of brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region.  Some brand names identified in the sources include "DEXMIN-ACD," "Tussin-DMR," "Kaykof-Q," "Coflez-DX," "Allerhin D Plus," "Altime CF," "Alvetus DMR," "Kozifed Plus," "Weecof DMR," "Cufsniff AD," "Cetmet Tcf," "Broncolite-AZ", and "ZEFCOLIN."


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

The combined effects of the individual components provide symptomatic relief from cold and flu symptoms. Ambroxol facilitates mucus clearance, cetirizine reduces allergic responses, dextromethorphan suppresses cough, and phenylephrine relieves nasal congestion.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** All four components are absorbed orally.  
* **Metabolism:** Primarily hepatic metabolism, especially by CYP450 enzymes for cetirizine and dextromethorphan.
* **Elimination:** Mainly renal excretion.

**Mode of Action:**

* Ambroxol: Modifies the structure and transportability of mucus.
* Cetirizine:  H1-receptor antagonist.
* Dextromethorphan:  NMDA receptor antagonist, sigma-1 receptor agonist.
* Phenylephrine:  Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist.


## **Dosage**
