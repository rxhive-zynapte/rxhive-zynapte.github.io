## **Usage**

- This combination medication is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of the common cold, flu, and allergies. It addresses symptoms such as cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose or throat, headache, fever, and body aches.  It is also beneficial in managing sinusitis and other respiratory infections, helping manage both acute and chronic allergic conditions.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This drug is a combination of several drug classes:
    - Ambroxol: Mucolytic, expectorant
    - Cetirizine: Antihistamine
    - Paracetamol: Analgesic, antipyretic
    - Phenylephrine: Decongestant
- **Mechanism of Action:**
    - Ambroxol thins and loosens mucus in the airways, facilitating expectoration.
    - Cetirizine blocks the action of histamine, reducing allergic symptoms.
    - Paracetamol inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, reducing fever and pain.
    - Phenylephrine constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving congestion.


## **Alternate Names**
- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific four-ingredient combination. However, different pharmaceutical companies market this combination under various brand names.
- **Brand Names:** Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region.  Several brand names are available in India, and examples may include (but are not limited to) those listed on sites like Apollo Pharmacy, myUpchar, 1mg, and Truemeds.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**
    - Ambroxol: Reduces mucus viscosity and promotes mucociliary clearance.
    - Cetirizine: Antagonizes H1 receptors, reducing allergic manifestations.
    - Paracetamol: Inhibits COX enzymes in the CNS, reducing pain and fever.  Its effect on peripheral COX enzymes is limited.
    - Phenylephrine: Stimulates Î±1-adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Absorption: All components are absorbed orally.
    - Metabolism: Primarily hepatic metabolism. Paracetamol is primarily metabolized by glucuronidation and sulfation pathways. A small portion is metabolized by CYP2E1 to a reactive metabolite, which is usually detoxified by glutathione.  Cetirizine minimal hepatic metabolism. The decongestant component, phenylephrine, is readily absorbed orally but undergoes significant first-pass metabolism, resulting in low bioavailability. Ambroxol undergoes hepatic metabolism, primarily glucuronidation.
    - Elimination: Renal excretion. Ambroxol is primarily eliminated by the kidneys. Cetirizine is eliminated primarily unchanged by the kidneys. About 80% of an oral dose of paracetamol is excreted in the urine within 24 hours, primarily as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. Phenylephrine is mostly excreted by the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:** See Pharmacodynamics.  All components exert their effects through the described mechanisms, leading to symptomatic relief of cold and flu.
