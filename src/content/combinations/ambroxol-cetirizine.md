## **Usage**

Ambroxol + Cetirizine is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of cough associated with respiratory tract infections, allergies, and other respiratory disorders like acute and chronic bronchitis, and bronchial asthma.  It is also used to manage allergic conditions such as hay fever, allergic conjunctivitis, eczema, hives, and insect bite reactions.

It's pharmacological classifications are:

* **Mucolytic:** Ambroxol
* **Antihistamine:** Cetirizine


Ambroxol works by breaking down thick mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up. Cetirizine works by blocking histamine, a chemical that triggers allergy symptoms.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no officially recognized alternate names for the combination. However, it is sometimes referred to as "Ambroxol-Cetirizine."  Several brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region. Some popular brand names may include Relent, Zistam-A (with Levocetirizine).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Ambroxol:**  Stimulates the serous cells of the bronchial glands to enhance the production of serous mucus in the respiratory tract. Ambroxol appears to modify the structure of the glycoproteins in bronchial mucus, decreasing its viscosity. It also increases the activity of surfactant in the lungs, promoting better air exchange and mucus clearance.
* **Cetirizine:** A second-generation antihistamine that selectively antagonizes peripheral H1 receptors. It reduces the effects of histamine, thus relieving allergy symptoms. Because of its minimal penetration into the central nervous system, it is less likely to cause drowsiness compared to first-generation antihistamines.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Ambroxol:**  Well-absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine.
* **Cetirizine:**  Rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Minimal hepatic metabolism; primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.


**Mode of Action:**

* **Ambroxol:** Modifies the structure and reduces the viscosity of mucus.
* **Cetirizine:** Competes with histamine for binding at H1 receptor sites.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**

* **Ambroxol:** No significant receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation is associated with its therapeutic effect.
* **Cetirizine:** Selectively binds to and blocks peripheral H1 receptors.

**Elimination Pathways:**

* **Ambroxol:** Primarily renal excretion after hepatic metabolism.
* **Cetirizine:** Primarily renal excretion of unchanged drug.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One tablet or 10ml syrup of Ambroxol 30mg + Cetirizine 5mg twice or thrice daily. Maximum dose should not exceed Ambroxol 120mg and Cetirizine 10mg per day.

#### **Children:**

* **2-6 years:** 2.5 ml syrup twice or thrice daily
* **6-12 years:** 5 ml syrup twice or thrice daily.
* **Above 12 years:** Adult dose.

Pediatric doses are approximations, and the physician should determine the optimal dose.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and adjust as needed based on renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment is necessary. Creatinine clearance should be assessed, and the dose/dosing interval should be adjusted accordingly.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No dose adjustment is typically required for solely hepatic impairment. However, caution is advisable. In patients with both renal and hepatic dysfunction, adjust the dose as per renal impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with epilepsy, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or other relevant conditions. Monitor closely and adjust treatment as needed.



### **Clinical Use Cases**  Dosage for clinical use cases such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations should be individualized according to the patient's specific needs and condition. No specific dosage recommendation can be given without the proper clinical evaluation. 


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Monitor renal and liver function, and adjust the dose based on creatinine clearance and liver function tests.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Drowsiness
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Dry mouth
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Constipation

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Allergic reactions (e.g., skin rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Severe drowsiness
* Irregular heartbeat


### **Long-Term Effects**

No specific long-term adverse effects have been reported with Ambroxol + Cetirizine use. However, long-term use should be monitored, particularly in patients with pre-existing conditions.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs include severe allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis, and severe skin reactions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. These require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to ambroxol, cetirizine, or any component of the formulation.
* Severe liver impairment
* Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <10 ml/min)
* Hypersensitivity to piperazine derivatives
* Patients with known allergy to piperazine derivatives, hereditary galactose intolerance, hereditary Lapp lactase deficiency, inherited glucose-galactose malabsorption disorder and severe renal dysfunction


## **Drug Interactions**

* CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, opioids)
* Antihistamines
* Aprepitant
* Midodrine
* Ritonavir 
* Some antibiotics like amoxicillin
* Blood thinners (Warfarin)
* Tricyclic antidepressants
* Herbal/Ayurvedic supplements

The combination should be used cautiously with medications metabolized by CYP450 enzymes.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult with a doctor before using during pregnancy.  It is generally not recommended during breastfeeding as cetirizine can be excreted in breast milk.
