## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of cough associated with mucus and the common cold.  It is also indicated for allergic rhinitis and other respiratory illnesses characterized by thick mucus secretions, nasal congestion, and cough.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination includes drugs from several classifications:
    - Ambroxol: Mucolytic agent
    - Chlorpheniramine Maleate: Antihistamine
    - Guaifenesin: Expectorant
- **Mechanism of Action:** Ambroxol works by breaking down mucopolysaccharides, which reduces the viscosity of sputum, making it easier to cough up. Chlorpheniramine maleate is an H1-receptor antagonist, blocking the effects of histamine and mitigating allergic reactions. Guaifenesin enhances mucus secretion and reduces its viscosity, aiding in the expulsion of mucus.


## **Alternate Names**

- There are no widely recognized alternate names for this specific three-drug combination.  However, various brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region. It is frequently sold in combination with other drugs like phenylephrine and menthol and can also include paracetamol. Some example brand names are Ambrohist Plus, Ambrocof Plus, Coscopin BR, and CC Gesic.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**
    - Ambroxol: Reduces mucus viscosity and has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.
    - Chlorpheniramine: Antagonizes H1 receptors, reducing allergy symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and itching.
    - Guaifenesin: Increases respiratory tract fluid, thinning and loosening mucus.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Absorption: All three drugs are absorbed orally.
    - Metabolism: Primarily hepatic metabolism for all components.
    - Elimination: Mainly renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:**
    - Ambroxol: Breaks down mucopolysaccharides in mucus.
    - Chlorpheniramine: Competes with histamine for H1-receptor binding sites.
    - Guaifenesin: Enhances respiratory tract fluid secretion.
