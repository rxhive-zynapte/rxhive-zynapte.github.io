## **Usage**

- This combination medication is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of cough and cold associated with allergies, flu, or other respiratory tract infections. It helps to relieve symptoms such as nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, cough, and watery eyes.
- **Pharmacological Classification**: This is a combination drug containing a mucolytic (Ambroxol), an antihistamine (Chlorpheniramine Maleate), and a decongestant (Pseudoephedrine).
- **Mechanism of Action**: Ambroxol thins and loosens mucus, facilitating its expulsion. Chlorpheniramine Maleate blocks histamine, reducing allergic symptoms. Pseudoephedrine constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving nasal congestion.

## **Alternate Names**
- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination.  The individual components are sometimes referred to by other names (e.g., ambroxol hydrochloride for ambroxol).
- **Brand Names:** Ambrodil Plus RF Syrup. Several other brand names may exist regionally.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Ambroxol stimulates the serous glands in the respiratory tract, increasing the production of thin, watery mucus. It also promotes ciliary activity, enhancing mucus clearance. Chlorpheniramine Maleate antagonizes the H1 histamine receptor, reducing allergic symptoms. Pseudoephedrine acts as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, causing vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa and reducing congestion.
- **Pharmacokinetics**:  Ambroxol is well absorbed orally and metabolized in the liver. Chlorpheniramine Maleate is also absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, and eliminated renally. Pseudoephedrine is absorbed orally and excreted both unchanged and as metabolites in the urine.
- **Mode of Action/Receptor Binding**: Ambroxol:  stimulates serous glands, increases surfactant production. Chlorpheniramine Maleate: H1 receptor antagonist. Pseudoephedrine: alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist.
- **Elimination Pathways**: Ambroxol and Chlorpheniramine Maleate are primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism and renal excretion. Pseudoephedrine is excreted renally, both unchanged and as metabolites.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The typical adult dose is one tablet or 10ml of syrup every 4 to 6 hours, not exceeding 4 doses (tablets) or 60 ml (syrup) in a 24-hour period.

#### **Children:**

- This medication should not be used for children under 6 years old unless otherwise advised by a doctor. Dosing above age 6 should be in accordance with body weight or age with particular pediatric formulations (syrup). The standard dose is 2-5 mL, depending on weight and age, every 4 to 6 hours.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and monitor for side effects. Dose adjustments may be necessary based on renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is advised.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction is recommended.

### **Clinical Use Cases**
