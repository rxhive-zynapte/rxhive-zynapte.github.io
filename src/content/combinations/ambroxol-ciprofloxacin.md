## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for respiratory tract infections, especially those with thick mucus or phlegm.  

**Pharmacological Classification:** This drug combines a mucolytic expectorant (Ambroxol) and a fluoroquinolone antibiotic (Ciprofloxacin).

**Mechanism of Action:** Ciprofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair. Ambroxol reduces mucus viscosity by breaking down mucopolysaccharide fibers, facilitating expectoration.  The combination may enhance Ciprofloxacin's antibacterial effect.


## **Alternate Names**

Ambroxol/Ciprofloxacin, Ciprofloxacin/Ambroxol


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ciprofloxacin exerts a bactericidal effect by inhibiting bacterial DNA synthesis. Ambroxol reduces mucus viscosity, improves mucociliary clearance, and may offer anti-inflammatory and local anesthetic effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Ciprofloxacin:** Absorbed orally, metabolized hepatically (CYP1A2), and renally excreted.  Bioavailability 70-80%.
* **Ambroxol:** Absorbed orally, metabolized hepatically, and renally excreted.

**Mode of Action:** Ciprofloxacin targets bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Ambroxol modifies the structure and transportation of mucus.

**Elimination Pathways:** Both drugs are primarily eliminated via renal excretion. Ciprofloxacin is also metabolized by CYP1A2.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Ciprofloxacin: 250-750 mg orally every 12 hours or 400 mg IV every 8-12 hours.

Ambroxol: 30 mg orally two to three times daily.


#### **Children:**

This combination is generally avoided in children. If used, dosing should be weight-based and determined by a pediatrician. Pediatric safety concerns include potential effects on growing joints.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Ciprofloxacin dosage reduction is needed based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution and potential dosage adjustment are required, especially for Ciprofloxacin.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with a history of seizures, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is typically not used in intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.  It is mainly prescribed for outpatient treatment of respiratory infections.  Specific dosing in these settings would need careful consideration.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dry mouth, headache, dizziness, insomnia, allergic reactions.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Tendonitis, tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, seizures, QT prolongation,  *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea, hepatotoxicity,  anaphylaxis.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions,  *C. difficile* infection,  QT prolongation,  severe tendonitis or rupture.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to either drug or quinolones, myasthenia gravis, concomitant tizanidine use.


## **Drug Interactions**

Theophylline, warfarin, NSAIDs, antacids, didanosine, dofetilide, dronedarone,  and some other antibiotics.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Generally avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Consult specialist if benefits outweigh risks.  Ciprofloxacin passes into breast milk, with potential risks like cartilage issues or teeth discoloration in infants.  Breastfeeding is not recommended while using Ambroxol.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Ciprofloxacin: inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase/topoisomerase IV. Ambroxol: mucolytic, improves mucociliary clearance.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, insomnia, allergic reactions; rarely: tendon rupture, seizures, *C. difficile* infection.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, myasthenia gravis, concomitant tizanidine.
* **Drug Interactions:** Theophylline, warfarin, NSAIDs, antacids.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally avoided.
* **Dosage:** Adults: Ciprofloxacin 250-750 mg every 12 hours, Ambroxol 30 mg two to three times daily. Pediatric use generally avoided.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, liver function,  signs of tendonitis, neurological symptoms.



## **Popular Combinations**

This specific combination is not a routinely used combination. Ciprofloxacin is often combined with other antibiotics in severe infections. Ambroxol is sometimes combined with bronchodilators or other expectorants.


## **Precautions**

* Pre-screen for allergies and organ dysfunction.
* Pregnancy:  Generally avoided.
* Breastfeeding: Generally avoided.
* Children:  Avoid combination if possible.
* Elderly:  Renal function monitoring is important.
