## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed to alleviate symptoms associated with the common cold, allergies, and upper respiratory tract infections. These symptoms include cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, and sneezing.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product with components belonging to the following classes:

*   Ambroxol: Mucolytic, expectorant
*   Desloratadine: Second-generation antihistamine
*   Phenylephrine: Decongestant (sympathomimetic amine)

**Mechanism of Action:**

*   Ambroxol works by reducing the viscosity of mucus by breaking down mucopolysaccharide fibers, facilitating expectoration. It also promotes surfactant production in the lungs.
*   Desloratadine is a selective H1-receptor antagonist that diminishes the effects of histamine, which is responsible for allergic symptoms.
*   Phenylephrine is an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, causing constriction of blood vessels in the nasal mucosa, thus reducing congestion.

## **Alternate Names**

While this specific combination may not have other established names, the individual components do. Desloratadine is marketed under brand names such as Clarinex and Aerius. Brand names for the combination itself may vary regionally.  This specific combination may be available under different brand names depending on the manufacturer and region.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

Ambroxol increases the production of secretions in the respiratory tract, including surfactant, aiding in making the mucus less sticky. Desloratadine blocks the effects of histamine on H1 receptors, reducing allergic symptoms.  Phenylephrine, by activating alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, alleviating congestion.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   Ambroxol is well-absorbed orally. It's metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily through the kidneys.
*   Desloratadine is also well-absorbed orally, with peak plasma concentrations reached in about 3 hours. Hepatic metabolism is extensive.
*   Phenylephrine's oral absorption can be erratic. It's metabolized by monoamine oxidase in the gastrointestinal tract and liver.


**Mode of Action:**

Desloratadine competes with histamine for binding to the H1 receptor, an action occurring at the cellular and molecular level. Ambroxol acts through several pathways, including breakdown of mucopolysaccharides, stimulation of serous cells, and increasing fluid in the airways, and enhancing ciliary transport to clear mucus. Phenylephrine acts by stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors in the vascular smooth muscle of the nasal mucosa, resulting in vasoconstriction.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, Neurotransmitter Modulation:**

*   Desloratadine: Selective H1-receptor antagonist.
*   Ambroxol: No direct receptor binding or enzyme inhibition identified as a primary mechanism of action.
*   Phenylephrine: Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist.

**Elimination Pathways:**

Primarily hepatic and renal for all three components.



## **Dosage**

Precise dosage information for this specific combination may vary based on formulation and manufacturer. Always consult the specific product literature and/or a medical professional for dosage recommendations.



### **Standard Dosage**
