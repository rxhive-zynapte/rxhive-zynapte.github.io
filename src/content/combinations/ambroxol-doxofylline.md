## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Ambroxol + Doxofylline is prescribed for respiratory conditions like bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and bronchitis, particularly when cough with mucus is a prominent symptom.  It is also used to treat and prevent respiratory disorders like asthma attacks and COPD exacerbations.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination drug containing a mucolytic (Ambroxol) and a bronchodilator (Doxofylline).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Ambroxol reduces the viscosity of mucus by breaking down mucopolysaccharide fibers, making it easier to cough up.  Doxofylline relaxes the bronchial smooth muscles, widening the airways and improving airflow to the lungs.

## **Alternate Names**

- While "Ambroxol + Doxofylline" is the standard generic name, regional variations may exist.
- Brand names for this combination include Doxo A, Doxjafy AM, Ventidox-Bro and  Nutra Respiro. Several other brand names are available in India as fixed-dose combinations of ambroxol 30 mg and doxofylline 400 mg have been approved since December 23, 2009.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ambroxol acts as a mucolytic, decreasing the viscosity of sputum. Doxofylline, a xanthine derivative similar to theophylline, acts as a bronchodilator by inhibiting phosphodiesterase enzymes, leading to increased intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels and subsequent smooth muscle relaxation in the airways.  It may also have some anti-inflammatory effects.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Doxofylline is rapidly absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of approximately 62.6%. It reaches peak plasma concentration in about 1.19 hours.  It has a volume of distribution of about 1 L/kg and is approximately 48% bound to plasma proteins. Doxofylline is extensively metabolized in the liver (about 90%) to inactive metabolites, primarily hydroxyethyltheophylline. Less than 4% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Ambroxol is also well absorbed after oral administration.
- **Mode of Action:** Ambroxol stimulates the serous cells in the bronchial mucosa, resulting in increased secretion of fluid into the airways, hence thinning the mucus. It also activates the cilia to enhance mucus transport. Doxofylline increases cAMP levels in bronchial smooth muscle cells, promoting relaxation and bronchodilation.  It also inhibits the release of inflammatory mediators.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Doxofylline inhibits phosphodiesterase enzymes, primarily PDE4. It has a lower affinity for adenosine receptors compared to theophylline, potentially reducing some of theophylline's side effects.  Ambroxol may modulate the activity of sodium channels and also interacts with surfactant protein systems.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Doxofylline is primarily metabolized by the liver with <4% excreted unchanged in the urine. Ambroxol is also extensively metabolized in the liver.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- One tablet (400 mg Doxofylline and 30 mg Ambroxol) two to three times daily.
- Maximum daily Doxofylline dosage is usually 1200 mg.

#### **Children:**

- Not generally recommended for children under 6 years of age.  
- Children over 6 years: 6-9 mg/kg of Doxofylline twice daily (consult product-specific guidelines; safety and efficacy are not fully established).
- Children >12 years: 200 mg of Doxofylline, twice or thrice daily, or 10ml syrup, twice or thrice daily.
- Children <12 years: 6-9mg/kg/dose Doxofylline, twice daily, as syrup.
- Pediatric use should be under strict medical supervision.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a reduced dose of 200 mg Doxofylline, twice or thrice daily.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage reduction is usually needed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage reduction may be required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution and monitor closely in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, epilepsy, or peptic ulcer. Doxofylline may increase blood glucose levels and can interact with other medications.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations should be determined on a case-by-case basis by the attending physician, considering the patient's condition and response to therapy.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on patient-specific factors, including renal/hepatic function, age, and coexisting medical conditions.



## **Side Effects**
