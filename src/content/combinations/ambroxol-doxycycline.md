## **Usage**

- Ambroxol + Doxycycline is prescribed for respiratory tract infections, particularly those with thick mucus, such as acute bronchitis, pneumonia, exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma with bacterial infections.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Mucolytic and Antibiotic (Tetracycline).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Ambroxol breaks down mucus, facilitating expectoration, while doxycycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, thus combating the infection.

## **Alternate Names** 

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for the combination itself. Components, doxycycline and ambroxol, have various brand names depending on the manufacturer and country.
- **Brand Names:**  Doxylab, Doxy Plus (examples, may vary by region).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ambroxol reduces mucus viscosity and improves mucociliary clearance. Doxycycline exerts bacteriostatic action by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, inhibiting protein synthesis.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - *Ambroxol*: Well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, and excreted primarily renally.
    - *Doxycycline*: Absorbed well orally, metabolized minimally, excreted in bile and urine.
- **Mode of Action:** Ambroxol breaks down mucopolysaccharides and mucoproteins, reducing phlegm viscosity.  Doxycycline blocks the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex, thus halting bacterial protein synthesis.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Doxycycline targets the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit.  Ambroxol's mechanism may involve inhibition of NO-dependent activation of soluble guanylate cyclase.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal for ambroxol, both renal and biliary/fecal for doxycycline.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily, or 50-100 mg twice daily, combined with standard ambroxol dosing (typically 30 mg two to three times daily).

#### **Children:**

- Doxycycline is generally avoided in children under 8 years due to the risk of tooth discoloration. For children above 8 years, the doxycycline dose is weight-based (typically 2.2 mg/kg twice daily for the first day, then 2.2mg/kg once daily or divided into two doses, along with suitable ambroxol dosing according to age and weight).
- Pediatric dosing requires careful consideration due to age-related differences in drug metabolism and potential adverse effects.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be needed based on renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction of doxycycline may be required depending on creatinine clearance. Ambroxol dose adjustments may also be needed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution advised with both drugs. Dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, gastrointestinal issues, and myasthenia gravis.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Dosages in specialized clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations should be individualized based on the patient's condition and overseen by a specialist.  The combination may or may not be indicated in these contexts.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjust dosages based on renal function, hepatic function, age, and other patient-specific factors.
- Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism might warrant adjustments. Consult clinical pharmacology resources and/or specialist advice if such considerations arise.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, taste changes, photosensitivity, numbness in mouth, tongue, or throat.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
- Severe allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatotoxicity, esophagitis, intracranial hypertension.

### **Long-Term Effects:**
- Tooth discoloration (especially in children under 8 years), altered intestinal flora, antibiotic resistance.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
- Angioedema, anaphylaxis, severe skin reactions, drug-induced liver injury.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to ambroxol or doxycycline, pregnancy (especially 2nd and 3rd trimester), breastfeeding (unless short-term use essential), severe hepatic impairment, myasthenia gravis, children under 8 years (for doxycycline), acute respiratory failure, peptic ulcer disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcerative colitis, gastritis.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Antacids, iron supplements, calcium, magnesium, or zinc supplements, bismuth subsalicylate, warfarin, isotretinoin, antiepileptics (phenytoin, carbamazepine), ciclosporin, other antibiotics (rifampicin), oral contraceptives, barbiturates.
- **CYP450 Interactions:** Doxycycline is a CYP450 substrate and can be affected by enzyme inducers or inhibitors. 
- Alcohol should be limited, as it might worsen certain side effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** D (high risk)
- Doxycycline is contraindicated during pregnancy due to risks of tooth discoloration and skeletal development issues in the fetus.  Ambroxol should also be avoided, especially in the first trimester.
- Doxycycline is excreted in breast milk. Short-term use might be acceptable if absolutely necessary, but safer alternatives should be considered.  Ambroxol is not recommended during breastfeeding.
