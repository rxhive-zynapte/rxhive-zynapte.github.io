## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of the common cold and allergies, particularly when accompanied by:

*   Nasal congestion
*   Runny nose
*   Sneezing
*   Itchy or watery eyes
*   Fever
*   Headache
*   Body aches
*   Cough with mucus

**Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing drugs from different classifications:

*   Ambroxol: Mucolytic
*   Fexofenadine: Second-generation antihistamine
*   Paracetamol: Analgesic and antipyretic
*   Phenylephrine: Decongestant

**Mechanism of Action:**  The components work synergistically to address various cold and allergy symptoms:

*   Ambroxol reduces mucus viscosity, facilitating expectoration.
*   Fexofenadine blocks histamine H1 receptors, mitigating allergic reactions.
*   Paracetamol inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, reducing fever and pain.
*   Phenylephrine constricts nasal blood vessels, relieving congestion.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no officially established alternate names for this specific combination. It's typically referred to by its constituent drug names. Brand names vary regionally (e.g., Coldifen, Genactive).

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

*   Ambroxol:  Decreases mucus viscosity and promotes its clearance.
*   Fexofenadine: Antagonizes the effects of histamine at H1 receptors, reducing allergic symptoms.
*   Paracetamol:  Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, reducing pain and fever.
*   Phenylephrine: Acts as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, constricting blood vessels in the nasal mucosa.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   Absorption:  All components are absorbed orally.
*   Metabolism: Paracetamol is primarily metabolized by the liver. Fexofenadine undergoes minimal metabolism. Ambroxol and phenylephrine are metabolized to varying extents.
*   Elimination: Primarily through renal excretion.

**Mode of Action:**

*   Ambroxol stimulates the serous glands in the respiratory tract and directly breaks down mucopolysaccharides, reducing sputum viscosity.
*   Fexofenadine selectively blocks peripheral histamine H1 receptors, reducing allergic symptoms.
*   Paracetamol's precise mechanism is not fully elucidated but is thought to involve inhibition of central cyclooxygenase, reducing prostaglandin synthesis.
*   Phenylephrine acts as an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist, causing vasoconstriction and reducing nasal congestion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One to two tablets every 12 hours, as prescribed. Dosage may vary based on individual component strengths.

#### **Children:**

Use and dosage must be determined by a doctor. Generally not recommended for children under 12.  Individual components may be prescribed based on age and weight.
