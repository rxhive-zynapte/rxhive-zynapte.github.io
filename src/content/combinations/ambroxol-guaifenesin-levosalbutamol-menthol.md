## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of cough associated with mucus (productive cough), particularly in conditions like:

* Bronchial asthma
* Acute and chronic bronchitis
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
* Respiratory tract infections (RTIs)

**Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing drugs from different classifications:

* **Levosalbutamol:** Bronchodilator (β2-adrenergic agonist)
* **Ambroxol:** Mucolytic/Expectorant
* **Guaifenesin:** Expectorant
* **Menthol:** Topical analgesic and counterirritant

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination works through multiple pathways to alleviate cough and mucus:

* **Levosalbutamol:** Relaxes the smooth muscles of the airways by stimulating β2-adrenergic receptors, leading to bronchodilation and improved airflow.
* **Ambroxol:** Reduces the viscosity of mucus by breaking down mucopolysaccharides, facilitating expectoration.
* **Guaifenesin:** Increases the volume and reduces the viscosity of respiratory secretions, making it easier to cough up mucus.
* **Menthol:**  Activates cold receptors, providing a cooling sensation that soothes throat irritation and the cough reflex.

## **Alternate Names**

There's no single international nonproprietary name (INN). It's often referred to by brand names, which vary regionally. Some formulations may use salbutamol instead of levosalbutamol.  A combination of ambroxol, guaifenesin, and terbutaline with menthol exists as well.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Levosalbutamol:** Bronchodilation, reducing airway resistance.
* **Ambroxol:**  Decreased mucus viscosity, increased mucociliary clearance.
* **Guaifenesin:** Increased respiratory fluid volume, reduced mucus adhesion.
* **Menthol:**  Sensory receptor stimulation, cough suppression, mild decongestion.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** All components are absorbed orally. Levosalbutamol has good bioavailability, though less than inhaled forms.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily hepatic metabolism for all components.
* **Elimination:**  Primarily renal excretion for all, with some biliary excretion.

**Mode of Action:**

* **Levosalbutamol:** Binds to β2-adrenergic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle, activating adenylate cyclase and increasing cAMP, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation.
* **Ambroxol:**  Stimulates serous and glandular cells in the respiratory tract, reducing mucus viscoelasticity through depolymerization of mucopolysaccharides.
* **Guaifenesin:** May stimulate vagal afferent nerve fibers in the gastric mucosa, increasing respiratory tract secretions and reducing mucus viscosity.
* **Menthol:** Stimulates TRPM8 (transient receptor potential melastatin 8) channels, creating a cooling sensation.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* Syrup: 5-10 ml three times daily.  Maximum daily dose depends on individual patient response and tolerance.
