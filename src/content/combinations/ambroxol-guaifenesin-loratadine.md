## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the relief of symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, and other respiratory tract infections with thick mucus. It is also used to treat allergic rhinitis (hay fever) characterized by sneezing, runny nose, watery eyes, itching, and congestion.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This is a combination drug including components belonging to the following classes:

*   **Ambroxol:** Mucolytic/Expectorant
*   **Guaifenesin:** Expectorant
*   **Loratadine:** Second-generation antihistamine

**Mechanism of Action:**

*   **Ambroxol** breaks down the structure of thick mucus, making it less viscous and easier to cough up.
*   **Guaifenesin** increases the volume of fluids in the airways, further thinning the mucus and facilitating its expulsion.
*   **Loratadine** blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during allergic reactions, thereby relieving allergy symptoms.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication may not have a universally recognized International Nonproprietary Name (INN).  It is typically referred to by the names of its constituents. Several brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and the region. Some examples as of today (2025-02-16) are:

* Lorfast-AM
* Alaspan AG

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

Ambroxol acts on the serous and mucous glands in the respiratory tract, promoting the secretion of thinner, less viscous mucus. Guaifenesin irritates receptors in the gastric mucosa, which triggers a vagal reflex leading to increased respiratory tract fluid secretions, ultimately thinning the mucus. Loratadine is a selective inverse agonist of peripheral H1 receptors. It blocks the effects of histamine, reducing allergic symptoms like sneezing, itching, and runny nose.


**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Ambroxol** is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 1-3 hours. It is metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted mainly in the urine.
*   **Guaifenesin** is also readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine.
*   **Loratadine** is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. It undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver, forming its active metabolite, desloratadine. Both loratadine and desloratadine are eliminated through urine and feces.


**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for all three components, with hepatic metabolism playing a significant role.


## **Dosage**

The dosage will vary according to the patient's age, overall health condition, and the severity of the symptoms.


### **Standard Dosage**  
#### **Adults:**  
A typical adult dose for this combination (as per the sources) could include:
* Loratadine 10mg
* Guaifenesin 200-400mg
* Ambroxol 30mg

This can be administered every 8-12 hours or as directed by the physician. The maximum dosage limits should be adhered to as prescribed by the doctor. Note that this dosage is an example.


#### **Children:**  
Pediatric dosing should be determined by a pediatrician, considering the child's weight and age. Some source suggest the following:
* 2-6 years old: 5 mg Loratadine/ 50mg Guaifenesin/ 30 mg Ambroxol twice daily
* 6-12 years old: 10 mg Loratadine/ 100mg Guaifenesin/ 30 mg Ambroxol twice daily

#### **Special Cases:**  
*   **Elderly Patients**: Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on kidney and liver function.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Dose reduction or increased dosing intervals may be required depending on the severity of impairment.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**:  Similar adjustments as for renal impairment.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Dosage modifications may be needed based on the specific comorbidity.



### **Clinical Use Cases**  
The combination is not usually indicated for specialized settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use. These settings require individual medication adjustments based on the patient's specific needs.

### **Dosage Adjustments**  
Adjustments are made based on renal or hepatic function, other medical conditions, drug interactions, and patient response.
