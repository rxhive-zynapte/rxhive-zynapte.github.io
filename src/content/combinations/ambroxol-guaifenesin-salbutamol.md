## **Usage**

- This combination is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of productive cough (cough with mucus) associated with bronchospasm, chest congestion, and shortness of breath.  It is commonly used in respiratory conditions such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Mucolytic, expectorant, and bronchodilator.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Ambroxol breaks down mucus, guaifenesin thins and loosens mucus, and salbutamol relaxes and widens the airways.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination. Variations may include the use of levosalbutamol (the active isomer of salbutamol) or the addition of menthol.
- **Brand Names:**  Numerous brand names exist depending on the region and manufacturer (e.g., Brozelin, Korf-AM, Eascof-LS).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**
    - Ambroxol:  Stimulates surfactant production, reduces mucus viscosity, and has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
    - Guaifenesin: Increases respiratory tract fluid volume, thinning mucus and facilitating expectoration.
    - Salbutamol: Relaxes bronchial smooth muscle by activating beta-2 adrenergic receptors, leading to bronchodilation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Ambroxol: Well absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, and excreted primarily in the urine.
    - Guaifenesin: Readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, metabolized in the liver, and excreted in the urine.
    - Salbutamol:  Absorbed orally and via inhalation, metabolized in the liver, and excreted in urine and feces.
- **Mode of Action:** Ambroxol acts on mucus glycoproteins, guaifenesin increases hydration of the airways, and salbutamol binds to beta-2 adrenergic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for all three components.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Syrup: 5-10 mL, three to four times daily.
- Tablets:  Specific dosage depends on the formulation.  Consult the product information for the prescribed brand.

- Above 12 years: 10 mL, two times daily or as directed by a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Start with a lower dose and monitor for side effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be needed. Consult current guidelines.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction may be necessary due to impaired metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution should be exercised in patients with heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, or peptic ulcer disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Dosages for specific clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergencies should be guided by the patient's condition and clinical judgment, as standard guidelines for these situations are not universally established for this specific drug combination.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments are based on patient-specific factors like renal or hepatic function, co-existing medical conditions, and potential drug interactions.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
