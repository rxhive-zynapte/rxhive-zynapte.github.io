## **Usage**

- This combination is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of productive cough associated with respiratory conditions like bronchitis, bronchial asthma, emphysema, and other bronchopulmonary disorders where bronchospasm, mucus plugging, and difficulty in expectoration coexist.  It is also used to treat cough with mucus and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD).
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination drug containing a mucolytic (Ambroxol), an expectorant (Guaifenesin), and a bronchodilator (Terbutaline).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Ambroxol works by breaking down the structure of mucus, making it less viscous and easier to expel. Guaifenesin increases the volume of fluids in the airways, further thinning the mucus and aiding its removal. Terbutaline, a beta-2 adrenergic agonist, relaxes the smooth muscles in the airways, widening them and easing breathing.

## **Alternate Names**

- No internationally recognized non-proprietary name exists for this combination.
- **Brand Names:**  Brand names vary regionally; some examples include Ascoril-D,  TusQ, Trump-A, and Kofarest PD.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ambroxol reduces mucus viscosity and promotes mucociliary clearance. Guaifenesin increases respiratory fluid volume and reduces mucus adhesiveness. Terbutaline relaxes bronchial smooth muscles, causing bronchodilation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Ambroxol:**  Well-absorbed orally. Metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted renally.
    - **Guaifenesin:** Readily absorbed from the GI tract. Metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine.
    - **Terbutaline:**  Administered orally or subcutaneously. Metabolized in the liver and excreted renally.
- **Mode of Action:** Ambroxol breaks down mucopolysaccharides in mucus. Guaifenesin is thought to stimulate receptors in the gastric mucosa, triggering a reflex increase in respiratory tract secretions. Terbutaline binds to beta-2 adrenergic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle cells, activating adenylate cyclase and increasing intracellular cAMP, leading to muscle relaxation.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for all three components after hepatic metabolism.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Syrup:  5-10ml three times a day (depending on the specific productâ€™s concentration). Maximum dose should not exceed 20ml three times per day. Consult the specific product's information for dosage.
- Tablets: Dosages vary depending on the product; consult product's information for dosage.

#### **Children:**

- Dosages vary with age and formulations (drops or syrup). Consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosing. Pediatric doses are generally lower and based on weight or age.
- Drops: Children (6 months - 2 years): 0.5-1 ml twice or three times daily. 
- Syrup: Children (2 - 5 years): 2.5 ml three times daily. Children (above 5 years): 5 ml 2 - 3 times daily.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate with lower doses and monitor closely for adverse effects. Dosage adjustments may be necessary depending on renal or hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce dose or extend dosing interval in severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with diabetes, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, or gastric ulceration. Close monitoring is recommended.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations:** The combination is typically not used in these settings. Terbutaline alone may be used in some cases for bronchospasm.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dosage adjustments are necessary based on patient-specific factors such as renal function, hepatic function, age, and comorbid conditions.
