## **Usage**

- Ambroxol + Guaifenesin is prescribed for respiratory conditions characterized by excessive mucus secretion, such as acute and chronic bronchitis, bronchial asthma, and other lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs).  It helps to relieve chesty coughs by thinning and loosening the mucus, making it easier to expectorate.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Mucolytic (Ambroxol) and Expectorant (Guaifenesin).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Ambroxol breaks down the structure of mucus, reducing its viscosity. Guaifenesin increases the volume and reduces the stickiness of secretions, facilitating their removal from the airways.

## **Alternate Names**

- While there isn't a universally recognized alternate name for the combination, the individual components have other names (e.g., Ambroxol hydrochloride, Guaifenesin).
- **Brand Names:** Ascoril, Brozelin, Mucolite (Ambroxol alone), Robitussin (Guaifenesin alone), and various other brand names depending on the region and manufacturer.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ambroxol acts as a mucolytic by breaking down mucopolysaccharides, thereby reducing the viscosity of sputum. Guaifenesin is an expectorant that increases respiratory tract fluid volumes, making the mucus less sticky and easier to cough up.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Both drugs are well-absorbed orally.
    - **Metabolism:** Ambroxol is metabolized in the liver, primarily by glucuronidation. Guaifenesin is also metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine.
    - **Elimination:**  Primarily renal excretion for both drugs.
- **Mode of Action:** Ambroxol stimulates the serous cells of the bronchial mucosa to secrete fluids containing surfactants. This action reduces the adhesion of the mucus to the bronchial walls and breaks down the mucus structure by altering the composition and structure of mucopolysaccharides. Guaifenesin is believed to exert its effect by irritating gastric vagal receptors which then stimulate respiratory tract secretions via a vagal reflex action. This increased fluid production reduces the viscosity of mucus, helping in its clearance by mucociliary action and coughing. 
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Ambroxol is believed to act, at least in part, by stimulating the release of lysosomal enzymes and by inhibiting the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neutrophils.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Ambroxol:  30 mg three times a day (up to 120 mg/day).
- Guaifenesin: 200-400 mg every four hours (up to 2.4 g/day) or 600-1200 mg every twelve hours (up to 2.4 g/day) for extended-release formulations.
- For combination products, please consult specific product literature.

#### **Children:**

- The dosage needs to be adjusted based on age and weight. It's important to consult specific product literature or seek pediatric consultation.
- Children under 2 years: Ambroxol + Guaifenesin is not recommended.  
- Children 2-5 years: Consult a doctor for suitable dosing adjustments.
- Children 6-12 years: Consult a doctor for suitable dosing adjustments.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be required based on individual kidney and liver function assessment.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce dosage based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustment may be required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer disease, or any condition affecting mucociliary clearance require careful monitoring and possible dosage adjustments.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- The use of this combination in specific clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU care requires careful individual patient assessment, and would generally not be recommended in such situations without a specific benefit assessment. It would not typically be part of established protocols in emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Modifications are based on individual patient factors such as creatinine clearance (renal function), liver function tests (hepatic function), comorbidities, and concomitant medications.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, skin rash.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis.

### **Long-Term Effects**

- No significant long-term adverse effects have been identified with standard dosages.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

-  Severe allergic reactions.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to either drug component.
- First trimester of pregnancy.
- Patients with severe liver or kidney impairment.
- Acute porphyria.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Cough suppressants (e.g., codeine) can lead to mucus accumulation.
- Some antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin, erythromycin) may have increased concentration in the mucus with ambroxol.
- Caffeine may increase the risk of side effects.
- Beta-blockers should generally not be used with salbutamol (if present in combination).
- Interactions with other medications are possible. Always consult a doctor regarding any concurrent medications, especially anticoagulants, antihypertensives, and thyroid medications.
- Alcohol may exacerbate drowsiness and dizziness.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Ambroxol: Should be avoided in the first trimester and used cautiously during other stages of pregnancy. Its use during breastfeeding requires careful risk-benefit assessment.
- Guaifenesin: Limited data; avoid if possible, use cautiously if benefits outweigh risks.
- Safer alternatives may be considered, depending on the clinical situation.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Mucolytic and expectorant, reducing mucus viscosity and aiding its removal.

- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, first trimester of pregnancy, severe liver/kidney impairment.
- **Drug Interactions:** Cough suppressants, some antibiotics, caffeine, beta-blockers.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid if possible, especially in the first trimester. Use cautiously if benefits outweigh risks.
- **Dosage:** Varies based on age and individual factors. Consult product literature or seek advice.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Respiratory status, side effects, and concomitant medication effects.


## **Popular Combinations**

- Ambroxol is sometimes combined with bronchodilators (e.g., salbutamol, terbutaline) or antihistamines (e.g., levocetirizine).
- Guaifenesin is often combined with dextromethorphan (cough suppressant).
- Rationale: To address different aspects of respiratory symptoms, providing broader relief.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess for allergies, hepatic/renal impairment, and other relevant comorbidities before prescribing.
- **Specific Populations:** Pregnancy (avoid in the first trimester), breastfeeding (use cautiously if benefits outweigh risks), children (adjust dosage based on age and weight), elderly (consider age-related factors).
