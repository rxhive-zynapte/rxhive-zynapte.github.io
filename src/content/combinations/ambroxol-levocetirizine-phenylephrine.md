## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of common cold, flu, and allergies. It addresses symptoms such as runny nose, sneezing, itchy or watery eyes, nasal congestion, and cough.  It is also used in the symptomatic management of sinusitis and bronchitis.

**Pharmacological Classification**: This drug combines three types of medications:

* **Mucolytic (Ambroxol):** Reduces the viscosity of mucus, making it easier to expectorate.
* **Antihistamine (Levocetirizine):** Blocks the action of histamine, reducing allergic symptoms.
* **Decongestant (Phenylephrine):** Constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving congestion.

## **Alternate Names**
There is no internationally recognized non-proprietary name for this combination. It is commonly referred to as Ambroxol + Levocetirizine + Phenylephrine.  Brand names vary regionally and include "Histacove-AD" and "STERIMMUNE COLD".

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics**:
* **Ambroxol**: Stimulates the serous cells of the bronchial mucosa to increase the secretion of fluid, which decreases the viscosity of mucus. Ambroxol also activates the ciliary function that promotes mucus transport.
* **Levocetirizine**: A selective H1-receptor antagonist, it binds to these receptors preventing histamine from binding and triggering the cascade of reactions responsible for allergic symptoms. 
* **Phenylephrine:** An alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist causing vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa, reducing swelling and congestion.

**Pharmacokinetics**:
* **Ambroxol**:  Well-absorbed orally. Metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted in the urine.
* **Levocetirizine**: Rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Minimally metabolized and primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.
* **Phenylephrine**:  Poorly absorbed orally. Metabolized by monoamine oxidase in the intestine and liver.

**Elimination Pathways**: Predominantly renal excretion for Levocetirizine and Ambroxol. Hepatic and intestinal metabolism followed by renal excretion for Phenylephrine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**
#### **Adults:**  The typical dosage is one tablet or 5ml of syrup two to three times a day, usually taken after meals. It's crucial to adhere to a physician's specific recommendation, as some formulations may differ in strengths.

#### **Children:** This medication is typically not recommended for children under six years of age. The recommended dosage for children 6-12 varies based on age and weight and is generally half the adult dose, usually twice a day. Pediatric dosages always require assessment and prescription by a healthcare professional.

#### **Special Cases:**
* **Elderly Patients**: Dosage should be adjusted based on renal function. Start with a lower dose and increase gradually as needed.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Dose reduction is necessary depending on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Lower doses are recommended due to reduced clearance.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions** Caution should be exercised in patients with uncontrolled asthma, hypertension, heart disease, hyperthyroidism, narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, coronary artery disease, ischemic heart disease, and prostatic hypertrophy. Consult a doctor before use.

### **Clinical Use Cases**
