## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of common cold, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, and other upper respiratory tract infections. It addresses symptoms like nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, itching, and cough.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination drug encompassing a mucolytic (Ambroxol), an antihistamine (Levocetirizine), and a decongestant (Pseudoephedrine).

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination. Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region. Some examples include Respicold and Sinarest AF.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**
    - **Ambroxol:**  Reduces mucus viscosity by breaking down mucopolysaccharide fibers and stimulating surfactant production. This facilitates expectoration.  It also exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.
    - **Levocetirizine:** A second-generation antihistamine that selectively antagonizes peripheral H1 receptors. This inhibits histamine-mediated allergic reactions like sneezing, runny nose, and itching.
    - **Pseudoephedrine:** Acts as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, causing vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa. This reduces nasal congestion.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - All three components are absorbed orally.
    - Primarily metabolized in the liver (Levocetirizine and Ambroxol). Pseudoephedrine undergoes some metabolism, but a substantial portion is excreted unchanged.
    - Excreted primarily through the kidneys.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- One tablet (containing Levocetirizine 5mg/ Ambroxol 60mg/ Pseudoephedrine 60mg) once or twice daily.  The exact dosage and frequency may vary based on the product formulation and should be as directed by the physician.

#### **Children:**

- This combination is typically not recommended for children under 12 years of age.  For children aged 12 and above, reduced doses are generally used under strict medical supervision. One formulation uses Levocetirizine 2.5mg, Ambroxol 30mg, and Pseudoephedrine 60mg for children aged 6â€“11.
- Pediatric safety is a primary concern, and this medication should be administered cautiously in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary due to age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is crucial, considering the renal excretion of the drugs.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose modification is necessary due to the hepatic metabolism of Levocetirizine and Ambroxol.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration is required in patients with heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, and prostatic hypertrophy.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Dosing in special clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations is not specifically defined for this fixed-dose combination. Dosage adjustments are determined by the physician based on the patient's individual needs and condition.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose modifications are necessary for patients with renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism. Specific adjustments should be based on clinical judgment and patient response.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Drowsiness
- Dizziness
- Dry mouth
- Headache
- Nausea and vomiting
- Stomach upset

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
- Cardiovascular effects (palpitations, tachycardia, hypertension)
- Seizures (in case of overdose)


### **Long-Term Effects**

- Limited data on long-term effects of the fixed combination are available. However, prolonged use of pseudoephedrine can potentially lead to tolerance and rebound congestion.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
- Cardiac arrhythmias


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any of the components.
- Severe renal or hepatic impairment.
- Narrow-angle glaucoma.
- Urinary retention.
- Severe hypertension or coronary artery disease.
- Monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) use within the past 14 days.


## **Drug Interactions**

- MAOIs: Risk of hypertensive crisis.
- Beta-blockers: Potential for increased blood pressure.
- Antihypertensives: Reduced efficacy of antihypertensives.
- Tricyclic antidepressants: Enhanced pressor effects of pseudoephedrine.
- Digitalis glycosides: Risk of arrhythmias.
- Diuretics: Decreased diuretic effectiveness.
- Anticholinergics: Additive anticholinergic effects.
- Other decongestants or antihistamines: Increased risk of adverse effects.
- Alcohol: Increased drowsiness and dizziness.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- The use of this combination during pregnancy and lactation is generally not recommended unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk. 
- Levocetirizine is Pregnancy Category B; pseudoephedrine is Category C, and Ambroxol's safety profile is not well-established in pregnancy.
-  Consult a physician before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
