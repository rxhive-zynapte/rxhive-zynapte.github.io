## **Usage**

Ambroxol + Levosalbutamol is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of cough associated with mucus, especially in conditions like:

*   Bronchial asthma
*   Chronic bronchitis
*   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
*   Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) such as acute bronchitis, pneumonia, and tuberculosis.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

*   Ambroxol: Mucolytic expectorant
*   Levosalbutamol: Bronchodilator (β2-adrenergic agonist)

**Mechanism of Action:**

Ambroxol works by thinning and loosening phlegm (mucus) in the lungs, windpipe, and nose, making it easier to cough out.  Levosalbutamol relaxes the muscles in the airways, widening them and improving airflow to the lungs.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is often referred to simply as Ambroxol/Levosalbutamol.  There are numerous brand names under which this combination is marketed, varying by region and manufacturer. Some examples include Ascoril LS, Soventus-LS, and EASCOF-LS.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

*   **Ambroxol:**  Stimulates surfactant production, reduces mucus viscosity, and enhances mucociliary clearance.
*   **Levosalbutamol:** Relaxes bronchial smooth muscle by stimulating β2-adrenergic receptors, leading to bronchodilation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Ambroxol:** Well absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine.
*   **Levosalbutamol:** Administered orally or by inhalation. Metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine.

**Mode of Action:**

*   **Ambroxol:** Modifies the structure of glycoproteins in mucus, reducing its viscosity.
*   **Levosalbutamol:** Binds to β2-adrenergic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle cells, activating adenylate cyclase and increasing intracellular cAMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation.

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**

*   Levosalbutamol:  β2-adrenergic receptor agonist.

**Elimination pathways:**

*   Both drugs are primarily eliminated through renal excretion, with some hepatic metabolism.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Syrup: 10 ml three times daily.

#### **Children:**

*   2-6 years: 2.5 ml three times daily.
*   6-12 years: 5 ml three times daily.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:**  Start with the lower end of the adult dose and adjust as needed based on renal and hepatic function.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustment is necessary in severe renal impairment.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, and seizure disorders. Close monitoring is advised.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific clinical settings should be determined by the attending physician based on individual patient needs and response.

*   **Intubation:**  Not typically indicated.
*   **Surgical Procedures:** Not typically indicated.
*   **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not typically indicated.
*   **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Not typically indicated.
*   **Emergency Situations:** Not typically indicated.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be required in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and in the elderly. Close monitoring of patient response and potential adverse effects is essential.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
*   Tremor, dizziness, headache
*   Sleeplessness, nervousness

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
*   Tachycardia, palpitations
*   Hypokalemia
*   Worsening of underlying cardiovascular disease

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic complications from prolonged use are not well established, but regular monitoring is advisable.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, paradoxical bronchospasm, and significant cardiovascular effects require immediate medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to any of the components.
*   Severe cardiovascular disease, including ischemic heart disease.
*   Thyrotoxicosis.

## **Drug Interactions**

*   Beta-blockers can antagonize the bronchodilating effects of levosalbutamol.
*   Other sympathomimetic drugs can have additive cardiovascular effects.
*   Xanthine derivatives, corticosteroids, and diuretics can potentiate hypokalemia.
*   MAO inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants can potentiate the cardiovascular effects of levosalbutamol.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Safety has not been fully established. Consult a physician before use.
