## **Usage**

- Ambroxol + Loratadine is prescribed for the relief of cough associated with allergic rhinitis and other respiratory tract disorders where both mucus secretion and allergic symptoms are present.  It helps to thin and loosen mucus while also relieving allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itching.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Mucolytic and Antihistamine combination.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Ambroxol, a mucolytic, works by breaking down mucopolysaccharides, reducing the viscosity of mucus, and promoting its clearance from the airways. Loratadine, a second-generation antihistamine, selectively blocks peripheral histamine H1 receptors, reducing the allergic response.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for the combination product itself, although the individual components have various names internationally.
- **Brand Names:**  The combination is marketed under various brand names depending on the region and manufacturer. Some examples might include Ambrolor, Loraxol, etc., although it is important to consult local pharmaceutical resources for specific brand names.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ambroxol increases the serous component of bronchial secretions and stimulates surfactant production in the lungs. Loratadine antagonizes the effects of histamine, thereby reducing allergic symptoms like sneezing, rhinorrhea, and pruritus.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Ambroxol is well-absorbed orally and metabolized in the liver. Loratadine is also well-absorbed orally and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism to its active metabolite, descarboethoxyloratadine (DCL). Both drugs and their metabolites are primarily eliminated via renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** Ambroxol acts on the secretory cells of the respiratory tract to enhance the production of serous secretions, leading to thinner and less viscous mucus. Loratadine competitively binds to peripheral H1 receptors, preventing histamine from binding and exerting its effects.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Loratadine selectively binds to peripheral H1 receptors. Ambroxol does not directly interact with receptors but modifies the properties of mucus.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Both drugs and their metabolites are mainly excreted through the kidneys.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Typically, one tablet containing 5 mg loratadine and 60 mg ambroxol is taken twice daily.  Other formulations may exist with varied strengths; dosing should be based on the specific product. Do not exceed the maximum recommended daily dose.

#### **Children:**

- Dosage should be determined by a pediatrician based on the child's age and weight.  For children 6-12 years old, the usual dose of loratadine is 5mg/day, while for children above 12 years, the dose is 10mg/day. 
- In general, the combination is not recommended for children below 6 years.
- Safety and efficacy in children younger than 2 years have not been established.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal and hepatic function. Start with a lower dose and titrate as needed.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** A lower initial dose and/or increased dosing interval (e.g., every other day) might be required for patients with severe renal dysfunction.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  A lower initial dose and/or increased dosing interval may be necessary for patients with severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider interactions with other medications and underlying medical conditions. Careful monitoring is advised.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- The combination is generally not indicated for specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its primary use is for symptomatic relief in outpatient settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
