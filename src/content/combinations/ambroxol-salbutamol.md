## **Usage**

Ambroxol + Salbutamol is prescribed for respiratory conditions characterized by excessive mucus secretion and bronchospasm, such as:

*   Acute and chronic bronchitis
*   Asthma
*   Bronchospasm
*   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
*   Pneumonia
*   Other bronchopulmonary disorders

**Pharmacological Classification:**

*   Ambroxol: Mucolytic, expectorant
*   Salbutamol:  β₂-adrenergic agonist, bronchodilator

**Mechanism of Action:**

Ambroxol works by breaking down and thinning mucus, making it easier to cough up and clear the airways. Salbutamol relaxes the smooth muscles in the airways, widening them (bronchodilation) and improving airflow to the lungs.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Ambroxol + Salbutamol" is the standard generic name, numerous regional or international variations may exist.  Brand names include (but are not limited to):

*   Ambrodil-S
*   Astharil-AS
*   Brozelin
*   Mucolex
*   Salmucolite
*   Salbrex
*   Amcoryl
*   Execof
*   Salhexin
*   Brovent
*   Ambryl



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

Ambroxol stimulates serous glands in the respiratory tract to produce less viscous secretions. It also activates the mucociliary system, aiding in mucus clearance. Salbutamol, by stimulating β₂-adrenergic receptors, relaxes bronchial smooth muscle, leading to bronchodilation and increased airflow.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Both drugs are well-absorbed orally.
*   **Metabolism:** Ambroxol is metabolized primarily in the liver. Salbutamol is partly metabolized in the liver and lungs.
*   **Elimination:** Ambroxol metabolites are excreted mainly in urine.  Salbutamol is eliminated primarily through the kidneys, partly as metabolites and partly unchanged.

**Mode of Action:**

Ambroxol acts by altering the structure and composition of mucus glycoproteins, reducing its viscosity.  Salbutamol stimulates β₂-adrenergic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle cells, activating adenylate cyclase, increasing intracellular cAMP, and ultimately leading to muscle relaxation.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**

Salbutamol binds to β₂-adrenergic receptors, which are G protein-coupled receptors. Ambroxol does not involve direct receptor binding or enzyme inhibition but acts on mucus structure directly.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Ambroxol is eliminated through hepatic metabolism and renal excretion. Salbutamol is eliminated through renal excretion (partly unchanged) and hepatic metabolism.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   Syrup: 10-20 ml (2-4mg salbutamol, 30-60 mg ambroxol) 2-3 times daily.
*   Tablets:  Consult specific product information for tablet dosages.


#### **Children:**

*   Syrup:  Dosage varies depending on age and formulation.
    *   2-6 years: 2.5-5 ml (0.5-1 mg salbutamol) 3-4 times daily.
    *   6-12 years: 5-10ml (1-2 mg salbutamol) 3-4 times daily.
    *   >12 years: Similar to adult dose, starting with the minimum.
    *    For oral drops, follow specific product literature.
*   Always consult product literature or a physician for precise pediatric dosing.


#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Initiate treatment with lower doses due to potential sensitivity.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment may be required.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider pre-existing conditions like diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and thyroid disorders when prescribing.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific medical settings may need to be adjusted based on individual patient requirements and clinical assessment. For intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations, consult a specialist for appropriate dosing recommendations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are necessary for patients with renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms. Titrate dosage based on clinical response and patient tolerance.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea

*   Hypokalemia (low potassium levels)
*   Hyperglycemia
*   Cardiac arrhythmias



### **Long-Term Effects:**

Potential chronic complications from prolonged salbutamol use include worsening of underlying respiratory disease and tolerance development.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome) are rare but require immediate medical attention.
