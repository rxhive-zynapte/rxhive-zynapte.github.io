      What is the difference between amiloride/hydrochlorothiazide and using
      amiloride or hydrochlorothiazide alone?**


      **A:**  Amiloride + Hydrochlorothiazide combines the actions of two
      different types of diuretics. Amiloride is a potassium-sparing diuretic
      that helps prevent the loss of potassium, while hydrochlorothiazide is a
      thiazide diuretic that helps to remove excess fluid from the body. Taking
      them together provides a more comprehensive approach to managing certain
      medical conditions and reducing side effects associated with taking either
      medication alone.

      Does food affect how well amiloride + hydrochlorothiazide works?**


      **A:** Yes. It is recommended that you take amiloride +
      hydrochlorothiazide with food. Food helps to improve the absorption of the
      medication into the bloodstream, making it more effective at managing your
      medical condition.

## **Usage**

- Amiloride + Hydrochlorothiazide is prescribed for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure) and edema (fluid retention) associated with congestive heart failure. It is particularly useful in patients prone to hypokalemia (low potassium levels) induced by thiazide diuretics.
- **Pharmacological classification:**  Potassium-sparing diuretic combined with a thiazide diuretic.
- **Mechanism of action:** This combination increases urination by promoting the excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys, while simultaneously conserving potassium.  Hydrochlorothiazide inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule, while amiloride blocks sodium channels in the collecting duct, preventing potassium loss.  This synergistic action addresses both fluid retention and electrolyte imbalance.

## **Alternate Names**

- **Generic Name:** Amiloride hydrochloride/Hydrochlorothiazide
- **Brand Name:** Moduretic (no longer available as a brand name, only generic formulations are currently marketed)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  The combination reduces blood volume through diuresis, leading to lower blood pressure. Amiloride's potassium-sparing effect mitigates hydrochlorothiazide's tendency to cause hypokalemia.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Both drugs are orally administered and well-absorbed.  Amiloride is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine, while hydrochlorothiazide undergoes some hepatic metabolism before renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** Hydrochlorothiazide inhibits the sodium-chloride symporter in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron, reducing sodium reabsorption.  Amiloride blocks epithelial sodium channels in the collecting duct, preventing sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for both drugs.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: One tablet containing 5 mg amiloride and 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily, taken with food.
- Maximum dose: Two tablets (10 mg amiloride/100 mg hydrochlorothiazide) per day, typically given as a single dose but may be divided.


#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for children under 18 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established in this population.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: Start at the lower end of the dosing range (5mg/50mg) due to potential age-related decreases in renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Contraindicated in severe renal impairment (anuria, acute or chronic renal failure), including diabetic nephropathy.  Use with caution in mild to moderate impairment, with close monitoring of serum electrolytes and renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Use with caution. Dosage adjustments may not be necessary, but close monitoring is recommended.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Use with caution in patients with diabetes, gout, systemic lupus erythematosus, and other conditions affecting electrolyte balance or renal function.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication's primary indications are hypertension and heart failure-related edema. Specific dosing for scenarios like intubation, surgery, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use is not generally indicated, as the dosage is based on the underlying condition being treated.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments may be required in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, as described above.  Patients with other comorbid conditions may also require careful monitoring and dosage adjustments.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Headache
- Dizziness
- Nausea
- Vomiting

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Not established.  Use only if clearly needed, and weigh the potential benefits against the risks to the fetus.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Hydrochlorothiazide is excreted in breast milk.  Amiloride's excretion is unknown but potential for adverse effects in infants exists.  It is generally recommended to discontinue breastfeeding or the drug.
