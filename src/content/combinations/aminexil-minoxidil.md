## **Usage**

- This drug is primarily prescribed for **androgenetic alopecia**, also known as male or female pattern baldness. It can also be used as a complement to hair transplantation procedures.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Hair growth promoter, vasodilator (Minoxidil).
- **Mechanism of action:** Aminexil + Minoxidil is a combination medication. Minoxidil is a vasodilator that widens blood vessels and opens potassium channels, increasing blood flow to hair follicles.  This provides more oxygen and nutrients to the follicles, promoting hair growth. Aminexil prevents collagen hardening around hair follicles, which can contribute to hair loss. It prolongs the hair growth phase and enlarges hair follicles.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names for the combination product exist.
- **Brand Names:** Hair4U, Hairjoy (with varying Minoxidil concentrations).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Minoxidil's vasodilatory effects increase cutaneous blood flow, delivering oxygen and nutrients to hair follicles and stimulating hair growth. Aminexil's mechanism is not fully understood but is thought to involve maintaining follicle flexibility and preventing perifollicular fibrosis, thereby promoting hair growth.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Topical minoxidil is minimally absorbed systemically. Aminexil absorption is limited as well, but both are metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine.
- **Mode of action:** Minoxidil opens potassium channels, causing vasodilation. Aminexil's effect on collagen buildup influences hair follicle health.
- **Receptor binding/enzyme inhibition:** Minoxidil acts on potassium channels directly.  Aminexil potentially impacts lysyl hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in collagen synthesis, but data on its mode of action are still limited.
- **Elimination pathways:** Predominantly renal excretion for both drugs, with some hepatic metabolism.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Topical solution: 1 ml applied twice daily to the affected scalp area.  Do not exceed 2 ml total daily dose.
- Available as 2% and 5% minoxidil solutions.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are typically required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised, and dose adjustments might be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, but dose adjustments might be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution advised for patients with cardiovascular disease. Consult with a physician if the patient has pulmonary hypertension or angina pectoris.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Aminexil + Minoxidil is not indicated for use in intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.
