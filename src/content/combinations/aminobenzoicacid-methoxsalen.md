## **Usage**

- Aminobenzoic acid + methoxsalen is prescribed for the treatment of vitiligo, a skin condition characterized by the loss of skin pigment, resulting in white patches.  It can also help prevent sunburn and premature skin aging.
- **Pharmacological classification:**  Photosensitizing agent, dermatological agent.
- **Mechanism of action:** Methoxsalen increases the skin's sensitivity to ultraviolet A (UVA) light, stimulating melanocytes (pigment-producing cells) to produce melanin. Aminobenzoic acid (PABA) acts as a sunscreen, absorbing ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation, protecting the skin from sunburn and further depigmentation.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names.
- **Brand names:** Melanocyl, Meladinine.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Methoxsalen intercalates into DNA and absorbs UVA light, causing activation of melanocytes and increased melanin production. Aminobenzoic acid absorbs UVB, offering photoprotection.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Topical application leads to minimal systemic absorption. Methoxsalen, when administered orally, is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine.  Aminobenzoic acid, applied topically, has limited systemic absorption.
- **Mode of action:** Methoxsalen enhances melanocyte function through DNA interaction and UVA absorption. Aminobenzoic acid acts as a UV filter, attenuating damage from UVB.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, neurotransmitter modulation:** Not applicable for topical application.
- **Elimination pathways:**  Topical application results in minimal systemic absorption for both drugs. For oral administration, methoxsalen undergoes hepatic metabolism with primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Topical: Apply a thin layer to the affected area 15-20 minutes before UVA exposure. Frequency and duration of treatment should be determined by a physician, typically twice weekly or on alternate days, with at least 48 hours between applications.


#### **Children:**

- Topical: Not recommended for children under 12 years old unless under strict medical supervision due to the potential for increased photosensitivity and long-term risks.



#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to increased risk of photosensitivity.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution advised; monitor renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution advised due to methoxsalen metabolism; monitor liver function.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution advised in photosensitive diseases like lupus.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, Emergency Situations:** The use of aminobenzoic acid + methoxsalen is not indicated in these settings.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments may be necessary based on patient response, skin type, and tolerance. Monitor for photosensitivity reactions.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Itching
- Redness
- Burning sensation at the application site


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Severe sunburn
- Blistering
- Skin discoloration (hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation)
- Unusual skin growths/moles/sores


### **Long-Term Effects**

- Premature skin aging
- Increased risk of skin cancer (with prolonged and improper use)
- Cataracts (especially with oral methoxsalen and inadequate eye protection)



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to methoxsalen, aminobenzoic acid, or any component of the formulation.
- Photosensitive diseases (e.g., lupus erythematosus, porphyria).
- History of melanoma or other skin cancers.
- Aphakia (absence of the lens of the eye).
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Photosensitizing agents (e.g., aminolevulinic acid): Increased risk of sunburn.
- Certain medications (e.g., some antibiotics, diuretics, antidepressants): May increase photosensitivity.
- Food and lifestyle factors: Avoid limes, figs, parsley, parsnips, mustard, carrots, and celery as they can increase sun sensitivity.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Contraindicated. Methoxsalen can cause fetal harm. Both men and women should use effective contraception during treatment and for several months after discontinuation.
- **Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated. It is unknown if methoxsalen or aminobenzoic acid are excreted in breast milk.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Stimulates melanocytes, provides photoprotection.
- **Side Effects:** Itching, redness, burning, photosensitivity.
- **Contraindications:** Photosensitive diseases, skin cancer, pregnancy.
- **Drug Interactions:** Photosensitizers, some medications, UV light.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
- **Dosage:** Topical application before UVA exposure.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Skin repigmentation, photosensitivity.



## **Popular Combinations**

- Used in combination with controlled UVA light therapy (PUVA).

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Patient education about photoprotection (protective clothing, sunscreen on unaffected areas, eye protection).
- **Specific Populations:**  Avoid in pregnancy, breastfeeding, and children under 12.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid excessive sun exposure, tanning beds.
