## **Usage**

- Amitriptyline + Ketamine is prescribed for neuropathic pain, such as postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy. Topical formulations can be used for localized pain. It may also be used for other types of chronic pain conditions, including pelvic pain.  
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination includes a tricyclic antidepressant (amitriptyline) and an anesthetic (ketamine). Hence it can be classified as an analgesic and anesthetic combination.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Amitriptyline increases serotonin and norepinephrine levels in the brain, inhibiting pain signal transmission. Ketamine blocks NMDA receptors, reducing pain sensation. The topical formulations act locally to alleviate pain.

## **Alternate Names** 

- There is no officially recognized alternate name for this drug combination. 
- It may be referred to simply as amitriptyline/ketamine or ketamine/amitriptyline.
- **Brand Names:** No specific brand names exist for this combination product as it is frequently compounded. However, amitriptyline is available under various brand names like Elavil, and ketamine is sold under brand names such as Ketalar.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Amitriptyline inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, increasing their synaptic concentrations and modulating pain transmission. Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist, blocking the receptor and decreasing pain sensation. Additionally, Amitriptyline exhibits anticholinergic and sedative properties, while ketamine also provides general anesthesia.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Topical administration results in localized action with minimal systemic absorption. Orally administered Amitriptyline is metabolized by CYP enzymes, primarily CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 in the liver.  Ketamine is metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4, to the active metabolite norketamine. Both drugs and metabolites are excreted mainly in urine. For oral administration, Amitriptyline's effects start within 1-2 weeks, and full effect is reached in 4-6 weeks.  Ketamine is rapid-acting when administered intravenously or intramuscularly.  
- **Mode of Action:** Amitriptyline acts by binding to presynaptic serotonin and norepinephrine transporters, preventing reuptake. Ketamine non-competitively blocks NMDA receptors within neuronal cell membranes.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Amitriptyline inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Ketamine inhibits NMDA receptors.
- **Elimination pathways:** Amitriptyline is primarily metabolized hepatically and excreted renally. Ketamine is also metabolized hepatically with renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

The dosage of amitriptyline + ketamine can vary widely based on the formulation (topical, compounded rectal suppositories, etc.), indication, and patient-specific factors. No standardized dosing guidelines exist for this combination. It is essential to consult with a pharmacist experienced in compounding or refer to the specific product information if using a pre-made combined product.


### **Standard Dosage**  
No standard oral or parenteral dose is established for the combination. Individual drug doses should be calculated based on the established guidelines for amitriptyline and ketamine separately. As of now, co-administration of oral or parenteral forms is less frequent in clinical practice.
#### **Adults:**
Topical formulations: A 2% amitriptyline/1% ketamine cream is commonly compounded and applied topically to affected areas. Other concentrations are available as compounded products.
#### **Children:**
Limited data exist on pediatric use. Use only under specialist guidance and if deemed essential after careful evaluation of risks and benefits.  Topical use might be an option, with concentration adjustments and careful monitoring.

#### **Special Cases:**  
Dose individualization and cautious initiation are important for all special populations due to the potential for interactions with other medications or altered pharmacokinetics of either drug. 
- **Elderly Patients** â€“ Lower initial doses with gradual increments.  
- **Patients with Renal Impairment** â€“ Dose adjustment might be needed for both components.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction** â€“ Dose reduction is often necessary, especially for amitriptyline.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions** â€“ Carefully consider cardiovascular conditions, diabetes, glaucoma, urinary retention, etc.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  
The combined use of amitriptyline and ketamine in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations for pain management is not established, except in scenarios where both are indicated and administered separately for independent effects. Research on the efficacy and safety of systemic co-administration for specific clinical indications is limited.
 Topical preparations may be used for managing post-operative pain in specific situations, but this is not the standard practice. 
### **Dosage Adjustments**  
Adjust doses based on individual patient characteristics, including renal/hepatic function, age, and concomitant medications. Therapeutic drug monitoring can be helpful for the oral or parenteral route.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**  
Dry mouth, constipation, drowsiness (amitriptyline), nausea, vomiting, application site reactions (topical formulations).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**  
Cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, hallucinations, allergic reactions (skin rash, itching, swelling). Suicidal thoughts and behaviours (amitriptyline), respiratory depression, increased blood pressure and heart rate (ketamine). Liver injury.

### **Long-Term Effects**  
Tolerance to analgesic effects (ketamine), chronic urinary tract issues (ketamine).


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Serotonin syndrome (amitriptyline with interacting medications), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (amitriptyline), severe cardiovascular effects (both drugs in combination).


## **Contraindications**
Hypersensitivity to either drug, severe cardiovascular disease, recent myocardial infarction, glaucoma, urinary retention, concomitant use of MAO inhibitors (amitriptyline), severe hepatic impairment, increased intracranial pressure (ketamine).

## **Drug Interactions**

Amitriptyline: MAO inhibitors, anticholinergics, CNS depressants, CYP2D6 inhibitors. Ketamine: CNS depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines), halothane, thyroid hormones, theophylline. Combined use may potentiate cardiovascular effects.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
Amitriptyline: Not recommended unless clearly necessary; excreted in breast milk. Ketamine: Limited human data; caution advised; unknown if excreted in breast milk. The FDA has not classified the pregnancy risk for ketamine and advises against its use in pregnancy unless clinically justified by a healthcare professional.  

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Amitriptyline increases serotonin/norepinephrine; ketamine blocks NMDA receptors.
- **Side Effects:**  See sections above.
- **Contraindications:** See section above.
- **Drug Interactions:** See section above.
