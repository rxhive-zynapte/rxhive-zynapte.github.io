## **Usage**

Amlodipine + Atorvastatin is prescribed for the concomitant treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia in patients who require both medications. It is also indicated for angina and coronary artery disease.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Amlodipine: Dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, antihypertensive, antianginal
* Atorvastatin: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin), lipid-lowering agent

**Mechanism of Action:**

This combination drug works through two distinct mechanisms:

* Amlodipine: Relaxes vascular smooth muscle by blocking calcium influx, leading to vasodilation and reduced blood pressure. Also improves myocardial oxygen delivery in angina.
* Atorvastatin: Inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, reducing LDL cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing HDL cholesterol.

## **Alternate Names**

The combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin itself does not have an international nonproprietary name (INN).

**Brand Names:** Caduet


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* Amlodipine: Decreases systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure. Improves coronary blood flow and reduces myocardial oxygen demand.
* Atorvastatin: Lowers LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. Increases HDL cholesterol. Reduces inflammation and improves endothelial function.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* Amlodipine: Well absorbed orally, peak plasma concentration in 6-12 hours. Extensive hepatic metabolism, primarily by CYP3A4.  Eliminated via renal and fecal routes. Half-life of approximately 30-50 hours.
* Atorvastatin:  Well absorbed orally, peak plasma concentration in 1-2 hours. Extensive hepatic metabolism, primarily by CYP3A4. Excreted mainly in bile. Half-life of approximately 14 hours.

**Mode of Action:**

* Amlodipine: Blocks L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle and cardiac myocytes, reducing calcium influx.
* Atorvastatin: Competitively inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, blocking the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate.


**Elimination Pathways:**

* Amlodipine:  Hepatic metabolism (CYP3A4), renal and fecal excretion.
* Atorvastatin: Hepatic metabolism (CYP3A4), biliary excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The starting dose is typically Amlodipine 5mg/Atorvastatin 10mg once daily.  The dose may be titrated based on individual response and tolerability up to a maximum of Amlodipine 10mg/Atorvastatin 80mg once daily.

#### **Children:**

Amlodipine/Atorvastatin combination is not recommended for use in children under 10 years old. For children over 10 years old, the typical starting dose is Amlodipine 2.5mg/Atorvastatin 10mg, adjustable up to 5mg/20mg. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 10 years.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Initiate amlodipine at the lower end of the dosage range (2.5 mg) due to potential for decreased clearance. Titrate carefully.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Amlodipine dosage adjustment is generally not necessary. Atorvastatin should be used with caution and may require a dose reduction.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Amlodipine/Atorvastatin combination is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease.  Amlodipine should be initiated at 2.5mg in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and titrated carefully. Atorvastatin is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with heart failure, severe aortic stenosis, and hypothyroidism. Monitor blood glucose in patients with diabetes.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The specific use cases outlined below (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations) relate to the individual components of the combination product and not the fixed-dose combination itself. The use of Amlodipine/Atorvastatin in these settings is based on the clinical judgment of the treating physician.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on individual patient response and tolerability.  Consider renal and hepatic function, concomitant medications, and comorbid conditions.  Dosage adjustments may be required for patients taking drugs that inhibit or induce CYP3A4.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Peripheral edema, headache, flushing, dizziness, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, hepatotoxicity, angioedema, allergic reactions, hypotension.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Increased risk of myopathy with long-term use, especially at higher doses. Monitor liver function regularly.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions,  rhabdomyolysis, significant hypotension, liver injury.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to amlodipine or atorvastatin, active liver disease, unexplained persistent elevations of hepatic transaminases, pregnancy, breastfeeding.

## **Drug Interactions**

CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, HIV protease inhibitors) can increase plasma concentrations of both amlodipine and atorvastatin. CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin) may decrease plasma levels. Avoid grapefruit juice. Other interactions may occur with certain antivirals, azole antifungals, and macrolide antibiotics.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Amlodipine: Calcium channel blocker, vasodilator. Atorvastatin: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, lowers cholesterol.
* **Side Effects:** Peripheral edema, headache, muscle pain, myopathy (rare), hepatotoxicity (rare).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, active liver disease, pregnancy, breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers, grapefruit juice.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
* **Dosage:**  5/10mg to 10/80mg once daily, adjusted based on response.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, lipid profile, liver function tests, creatine kinase (if muscle symptoms develop).


## **Popular Combinations**

Amlodipine is often combined with other antihypertensives like ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or thiazide diuretics. Atorvastatin may be combined with other lipid-lowering therapies like ezetimibe in cases of severe hypercholesterolemia.

## **Precautions**

Use with caution in patients with heart failure, severe aortic stenosis, hepatic impairment, and hypothyroidism. Monitor liver function and creatine kinase if muscle symptoms occur. Limit alcohol consumption.
