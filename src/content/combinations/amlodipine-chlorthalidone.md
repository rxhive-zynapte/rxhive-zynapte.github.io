## **Usage**

- Amlodipine + Chlorthalidone is primarily prescribed for the treatment of **hypertension** (high blood pressure). It may also be used to treat edema (fluid retention).
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antihypertensive (combination drug containing a calcium channel blocker and a thiazide diuretic).
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination therapy lowers blood pressure through two distinct mechanisms. Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, inhibits calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle cells, causing vasodilation. Chlorthalidone, a thiazide diuretic, promotes diuresis by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron, reducing blood volume.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination.
- **Brand Names:**  Numerous brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region (e.g., Amlodac CH).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Amlodipine reduces peripheral vascular resistance, lowering blood pressure. Chlorthalidone reduces blood volume through its diuretic action, further contributing to blood pressure reduction. The combination offers a synergistic effect.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - **Amlodipine:** Well absorbed orally, peak plasma concentrations reached in 6-12 hours. Extensively metabolized by the liver (CYP3A4 substrate), primarily excreted in the urine and feces. Long half-life (30-50 hours).
    - **Chlorthalidone:** Well absorbed orally, peak plasma concentrations in 2-4 hours. Not extensively metabolized, primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Long half-life (40-60 hours).
- **Mode of Action:** Amlodipine blocks L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle, preventing calcium influx, which leads to vasodilation. Chlorthalidone inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron, increasing sodium and water excretion.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Amlodipine is primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism (CYP3A4) and subsequent excretion in urine and feces. Chlorthalidone is primarily eliminated unchanged by renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: Amlodipine 2.5-5 mg + Chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg once daily.
- Titration: Dosage can be adjusted based on individual patient response, typically over 7-14 days.
- Maximum dose: Amlodipine 10 mg + Chlorthalidone 25 mg once daily.

#### **Children:**

- Not typically recommended for pediatric use. Safety and efficacy not well established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and titrate cautiously due to increased sensitivity.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Adjust dose based on renal function. Close monitoring is necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dose adjustments may be needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor closely, especially in patients with diabetes, heart failure, or other cardiovascular diseases.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations:** Dosage adjustments are determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the specific clinical context and patient status.  This combination is not typically adjusted for these situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**
