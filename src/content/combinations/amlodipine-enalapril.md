## **Usage**

- Amlodipine + Enalapril is prescribed for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure).  It may also be used for other conditions as determined by a physician.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antihypertensive (combination of a calcium channel blocker and an ACE inhibitor).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Amlodipine blocks calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle, causing vasodilation and reducing cardiac workload. Enalapril inhibits the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), preventing the formation of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor.  This leads to vasodilation and decreased aldosterone secretion, reducing blood volume and further lowering blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate generic names.
- **Brand Names:** Amace, Amlogen-EL, Amlovin-E, Amtas-E, Amzel-EL, Dilvas-Am, Entp-A, Hytrol-Am, Klodip Ace (India). Brand names may vary by region.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Amlodipine reduces systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure through vasodilation. It has minimal negative inotropic effects. Enalapril reduces peripheral vascular resistance, blood volume, and cardiac afterload.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Amlodipine is well absorbed orally, with peak plasma concentrations reached in 6-12 hours.  Enalapril is rapidly absorbed, with peak concentrations of enalaprilat (the active metabolite) occurring in 3-4 hours. Food does not significantly affect the absorption of either drug.
    - **Metabolism:** Amlodipine is extensively metabolized by the liver.  Enalapril is hydrolyzed to enalaprilat.
    - **Elimination:** Amlodipine is excreted primarily in the urine and feces as metabolites. Enalaprilat is primarily excreted by the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:**
    - **Amlodipine:** Inhibits calcium influx through L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle, leading to vasodilation.
    - **Enalapril:** Inhibits ACE, preventing conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**
    - **Amlodipine:**  L-type calcium channel blocker.
    - **Enalapril:** ACE inhibitor.
- **Elimination Pathways:**
    - **Amlodipine:** Hepatic metabolism, renal and fecal excretion.
    - **Enalapril:** Renal excretion of enalaprilat.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: Amlodipine 5 mg + Enalapril 10 mg once daily.
- Maintenance dose:  May be increased to a maximum of Amlodipine 10 mg + Enalapril 20 mg per day as needed to control blood pressure.

#### **Children:**

- Use is generally not recommended in children under 6 years of age. For children older than 6 years, dosing must be determined by a doctor based on weight and medical condition.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and titrate cautiously.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce the dose based on the degree of impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Start with a lower dose and titrate cautiously.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Dosage adjustment may be required depending on the specific comorbidity.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing in these settings should be individualized based on patient needs and clinical status under the guidance of a specialist:

- **Intubation:**  Maintain usual antihypertensive regimen unless contraindicated.
- **Surgical Procedures:**  Continue medication as directed by anesthesiologist and surgeon.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Continue as directed by critical care team.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Monitor and adjust dose based on patient status.
- **Emergency Situations:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary; consult specialist.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Renal/hepatic dysfunction: Reduce dose.
- Metabolic disorders: Adjust dose as needed.
- Genetic polymorphisms: Consider if impacting drug metabolism.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Dizziness, headache, fatigue, peripheral edema, cough.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Angioedema, hypotension, syncope, renal failure, hyperkalemia.

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Renal impairment (with prolonged use of enalapril), electrolyte imbalances.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Angioedema, severe hypotension, acute renal failure.


## **Contraindications**

- Alcohol may enhance the hypotensive effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Contraindicated, especially during the second and third trimesters, due to the risk of fetal harm.
- **Breastfeeding:** Amlodipine passes into breast milk, enalapril in minimal amounts; use with caution and monitor infant for hypotension.

- **Side Effects:** Dizziness, headache, edema, cough, angioedema (rare).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, angioedema history, pregnancy.
- **Drug Interactions:** Aliskiren, potassium supplements, NSAIDs, some statins.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid in pregnancy. Use with caution during breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** Adults: initially 5/10 mg once daily, up to 10/20 mg.

- Often used as a single-pill combination for synergistic antihypertensive effects.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Monitor renal function, potassium levels, blood pressure.
- **Specific Populations:**
    - **Pregnant Women:** Contraindicated.
    - **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Use with caution.
    - **Children & Elderly:** Dosage adjustments may be required.
