## **Usage**

This combination drug is prescribed for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure) in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by two-drug combinations of the individual components or by other antihypertensive agents from two of the three drug classes it contains.  It is **not** indicated for initial therapy of hypertension.

It falls under the following pharmacological classifications:

* **Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB):** Olmesartan medoxomil blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that constricts blood vessels.
* **Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB):** Amlodipine relaxes and widens blood vessels by blocking calcium channels.
* **Thiazide Diuretic:** Hydrochlorothiazide helps the kidneys eliminate excess salt and water, thereby reducing blood volume and lowering blood pressure.

The combined mechanism of action results in synergistic blood pressure reduction through different pathways.

## **Alternate Names**

This triple combination drug is often referred to by the brand name **Tribenzor**.  It is also available as generic olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide.  There aren't widely used international or regional variations of this combined name, although individual components may have different names in certain regions.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Olmesartan:** Blocks angiotensin II receptors, leading to vasodilation and reduced aldosterone secretion, which lowers blood volume.
* **Amlodipine:** Inhibits calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle cells, causing vasodilation.
* **Hydrochlorothiazide:** Inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney, increasing sodium and water excretion, thus reducing blood volume.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Olmesartan:**  Administered as a prodrug (olmesartan medoxomil), rapidly converted to olmesartan during absorption.  High bioavailability, metabolized by ester hydrolysis, primarily excreted in feces and urine.  Peak plasma concentration is reached within 1 to 2 hours.
* **Amlodipine:** Well absorbed orally, high bioavailability, extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4 enzymes. Has a long half-life (approximately 30-50 hours), allowing for once-daily dosing. Excreted mainly in urine and feces. Peak plasma concentration is reached within 6 to 12 hours.
* **Hydrochlorothiazide:**  Orally administered, incompletely absorbed, not metabolized significantly, primarily excreted unchanged in urine. Peak plasma concentration is reached within 1 to 2.5 hours.


**Mode of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**

* **Olmesartan:** Selectively binds to the AT1 subtype of angiotensin II receptors.
* **Amlodipine:** Inhibits L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle.
* **Hydrochlorothiazide:** Inhibits sodium-chloride symporter in the distal convoluted tubule.

**Elimination Pathways:**

* **Olmesartan:** Primarily biliary and renal excretion.
* **Amlodipine:** Hepatic metabolism (CYP3A4) followed by renal and fecal excretion.
* **Hydrochlorothiazide:** Renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Initial dose: Typically starts with 20 mg olmesartan medoxomil / 5 mg amlodipine / 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily.

Dosage may be increased in 2-week intervals as needed, titrating each component individually up to a maximum of 40 mg olmesartan medoxomil / 10 mg amlodipine / 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily.


#### **Children:**

Not recommended for use in patients below 18 years due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution, particularly in patients over 75 years old. Dose adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Avoid use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min).  No adjustment is generally required for mild to moderate impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is required in patients with diabetes, heart failure, or electrolyte imbalances.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This drug is specifically designed for chronic hypertension management. It is not indicated for acute situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient response, renal function, hepatic function, and concomitant medications.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Dizziness, peripheral edema, headache, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, muscle spasms, nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, urinary tract infection, joint swelling.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential long-term effects include electrolyte imbalances, renal impairment, and cardiovascular events if blood pressure is not adequately controlled.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs requiring immediate intervention include severe hypotension, angioedema, acute renal failure, and electrolyte imbalances.

## **Contraindications**

* **Aliskiren:** Contraindicated in patients with diabetes or renal impairment.
* **Lithium:** Increased lithium levels and toxicity.
* **NSAIDs:** Reduced antihypertensive effect, increased risk of renal impairment.
* **CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir):** Increased amlodipine levels.
* **Cyclosporine, Tacrolimus:** Increased cyclosporine and tacrolimus levels.
* **Diuretics:** Additive effects.
* **Antidiabetic drugs:** May require dosage adjustment.


Interactions may also occur with alcohol, potassium supplements, and other antihypertensive medications. Consult a comprehensive drug interaction resource for a complete list.
