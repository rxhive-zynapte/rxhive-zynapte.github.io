## **Usage**

- This combination drug is prescribed for the treatment of **hypertension (high blood pressure)**. It is typically used when other blood pressure medications have not been effective.  It is not recommended as an initial therapy for hypertension.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antihypertensive; it comprises a calcium channel blocker (CCB), an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and a thiazide diuretic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This triple-combination therapy lowers blood pressure through three distinct mechanisms: Valsartan blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that constricts blood vessels. Amlodipine blocks calcium entry into heart and blood vessel cells, promoting relaxation and increasing blood flow. Hydrochlorothiazide increases urine production, reducing excess fluid in the body and lowering blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

- Amlodipine/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide
- Amlodipine besylate/Valsartan/Hydrochlorothiazide
- **Brand Name:** Exforge HCT

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Valsartan blocks the vasoconstricting effects of angiotensin II, amlodipine reduces peripheral vascular resistance, and hydrochlorothiazide decreases blood volume by increasing sodium and water excretion. The combination of these actions synergistically lowers blood pressure.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** All three drugs are orally absorbed. Amlodipine is highly protein-bound and extensively metabolized by the liver. Valsartan has high bioavailability but limited metabolism. Hydrochlorothiazide is minimally metabolized and primarily excreted by the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:** Valsartan acts as an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, specifically AT1 receptors. Amlodipine inhibits calcium influx through L-type calcium channels. Hydrochlorothiazide inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Amlodipine is primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism with some renal excretion of metabolites. Valsartan undergoes biliary excretion. Hydrochlorothiazide is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: One tablet orally once a day.  Available strengths include 5/160/12.5 mg, 10/160/12.5 mg, 5/160/25 mg, 10/160/25 mg, and 10/320/25 mg (amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide).
- The dosage may be increased after 2 weeks if needed.  The maximum dose is 10 mg/320 mg/25 mg orally once daily.

#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy have not been established in children. The use of this combination is not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No initial dose adjustment is required, but caution should be exercised when titrating to the maximum dose.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment. Close monitoring is essential.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution in mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Avoid use in severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with heart failure, coronary artery disease, or diabetes.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation:** No specific dosage adjustments for intubation.
- **Surgical Procedures:** No specific dosage adjustments for surgical procedures.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** No specific dosage adjustments for mechanical ventilation.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  Dose adjustments may be needed based on the patient's condition and other medications.
- **Emergency Situations:** No specific emergency dosing recommendations.  Treat underlying condition and manage blood pressure as appropriate.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments are based on individual patient response and tolerability. Consider renal function, hepatic function, and other medical conditions when adjusting the dose.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Dizziness, headache, fatigue, nausea, upset stomach, back pain, muscle spasms, peripheral edema (swelling in hands, ankles, or feet).


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Hypotension (low blood pressure), angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), kidney dysfunction, liver problems, electrolyte imbalances (low potassium or magnesium), allergic reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Long-term effects are not fully characterized but could include electrolyte abnormalities and potential kidney or liver problems.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Angioedema, severe hypotension, acute renal failure, liver injury, and hypersensitivity reactions.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any of the components, including sulfonamides.

- Concurrent use of aliskiren in patients with diabetes.

## **Drug Interactions**

- **NSAIDs:** May reduce antihypertensive effect.
- **Lithium:** May increase lithium levels.
- **Alcohol:** May enhance dizziness and hypotension.
- **CYP3A4 Inhibitors/Inducers:** May affect amlodipine metabolism.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** D (contraindicated)
- Fetal toxicity is a significant concern, particularly during the second and third trimesters.  Discontinue use if pregnancy is detected.
- Small amounts of hydrochlorothiazide are excreted in breast milk;  amlodipine and valsartan may also be present.  Breastfeeding is not recommended.
