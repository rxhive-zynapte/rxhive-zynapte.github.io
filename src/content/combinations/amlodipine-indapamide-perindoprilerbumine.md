      What is the recommended dosage for Amlodipine + Indapamide + Perindopril
      erbumine?**


      **A:** One tablet daily, administered orally, preferably in the morning
      before food. The specific strengths of the components should match the
      patient's previous regimen of the individual drugs.  This combination is
      not for initial therapy, but as a substitution once patients are stable on
      separate components.

## **Usage**

- This combination drug is primarily prescribed for the treatment of **hypertension** (high blood pressure) in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with dual therapies or as initial therapy for patients anticipated to require multiple medications to achieve blood pressure goals.  It is specifically indicated for **substitution therapy**, meaning it should only be used in patients already stabilized on the individual components. It is **not suitable for initial therapy**.
- **Pharmacological Classifications:**  This fixed-dose combination (FDC) comprises three antihypertensive agents belonging to different classes:
    - **Perindopril:** Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitor
    - **Indapamide:** Thiazide-like diuretic
    - **Amlodipine:** Calcium channel blocker (CCB), dihydropyridine type
- **Mechanism of Action:**  The combined action of these drugs targets multiple mechanisms involved in blood pressure regulation:
    - **Perindopril:** Inhibits the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. This leads to vasodilation, reduces aldosterone secretion, and decreases sodium and water retention.
    - **Indapamide:** Decreases sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidneys, promoting diuresis and lowering blood volume, thereby reducing blood pressure.
    - **Amlodipine:** Inhibits calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle cells, resulting in vasodilation and decreased peripheral vascular resistance.


## **Alternate Names**

- This triple combination is often referred to by the individual drug names (Perindopril + Indapamide + Amlodipine).
- **Brand Name:** TriplixamÂ® (available in some regions).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**
    - The combined effects of Perindopril, Indapamide, and Amlodipine result in a synergistic reduction in blood pressure through vasodilation, reduced blood volume, and decreased peripheral vascular resistance.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** All three components are orally absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations achieved within 1-2 hours for Perindopril and Amlodipine, and 1.5 hours for Indapamide.
    - **Metabolism:** Perindopril is a prodrug that is hydrolyzed to its active metabolite, perindoprilat.  Amlodipine undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism. Indapamide is minimally metabolized.
    - **Elimination:** Perindopril is primarily excreted renally, while Amlodipine and Indapamide are excreted through both renal and hepatic pathways.
- **Mode of Action:**
    - **Perindopril:** Inhibits ACE, blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).
    - **Indapamide:**  Acts on the sodium-chloride cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule.
    - **Amlodipine:** Blocks L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**
    - **Perindopril:** ACE enzyme inhibition.
    - **Indapamide:** Sodium-chloride cotransporter inhibition.
    - **Amlodipine:** Calcium channel blockade.
- **Elimination Pathways:**
    - Primarily renal excretion for Perindopril.
    - Both renal and hepatic elimination for Amlodipine and Indapamide.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The standard dose is one tablet daily, preferably in the morning before a meal, matching the dose levels of the individual components previously taken.
- Dose titration should be done with individual components, not the FDC, if adjustment is necessary.

#### **Children:**

- The safety and efficacy of this FDC have not been established in children.  Use is not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate treatment with individual components and closely monitor blood pressure and renal function due to age-related decreases in drug clearance.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30-60 mL/min): Avoid dosages of Perindopril/Indapamide 10/2.5 mg combined with Amlodipine 5 or 10 mg. Initiate treatment with the individual components and adjust accordingly.  Severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min): Contraindicated.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Severe hepatic impairment: Contraindicated. Mild to moderate hepatic impairment: Use with caution and initiate with lower doses of the individual components.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is essential in patients with diabetes, heart failure, and other cardiovascular diseases.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- This FDC is specifically for chronic hypertension management and is not intended for use in acute clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Individual components might be utilized in these settings, but not the fixed-dose combination.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments should be based on individual patient factors including renal/hepatic dysfunction, comorbid conditions, and therapeutic response.  Titration should be done with individual drug components rather than the FDC.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Peripheral edema, headache, dizziness, cough, flushing, nausea, abdominal pain.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Angioedema, hypotension, syncope, hyperkalemia, acute renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, pancreatitis, blood dyscrasias.


### **Long-Term Effects**

- Electrolyte imbalances, renal impairment, worsening of heart failure.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Angioedema, anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis.



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any of the components (Perindopril, Indapamide, Amlodipine), sulfonamides, or other ACE inhibitors.
- History of angioedema (including hereditary or idiopathic).
- Pregnancy (second and third trimesters).
- Breastfeeding.
- Severe renal or hepatic impairment.
- Untreated decompensated heart failure.
- Concomitant use with sacubitril/valsartan or aliskiren (especially in patients with diabetes or renal impairment).


## **Drug Interactions**

- **Clinically significant interactions:** Aliskiren, sacubitril/valsartan, lithium, potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), other antihypertensives, certain immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus), and some antidepressants.
- **CYP450 Interactions:** Amlodipine is a substrate of CYP3A4; concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers can alter its plasma levels.
- **Food and lifestyle factors:** Avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice as they can increase amlodipine levels. Alcohol can potentiate the hypotensive effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Contraindicated during the second and third trimesters. Not recommended during the first trimester. ACE inhibitors can cause fetal harm.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Contraindicated.  Amlodipine and Perindopril are excreted in breast milk.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Synergistic antihypertensive effects through RAAS inhibition, diuresis, and calcium channel blockade.
