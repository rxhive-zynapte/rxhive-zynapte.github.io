## **Usage**

- Amlodipine + Irbesartan is prescribed for the treatment of essential hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults. It is specifically indicated for patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by monotherapy with either amlodipine or irbesartan.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antihypertensive, combining a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) (irbesartan).
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination therapy lowers blood pressure through two distinct mechanisms. Amlodipine inhibits calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to vasodilation. Irbesartan blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that causes vasoconstriction, further promoting vasodilation and reducing blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

- This fixed-dose combination is often referred to as amlodipine/irbesartan.
- **Brand Names:** Aprovasc, Co-Aprovel

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Amlodipine exerts its antihypertensive effect by inhibiting the influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle, resulting in vasodilation and decreased peripheral vascular resistance. Irbesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. These complementary actions result in a synergistic reduction in blood pressure.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Both amlodipine and irbesartan are orally active. Amlodipine is well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations occurring in 6 to 12 hours.  Irbesartan is also well absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations reached in 1.5 to 2 hours. The concurrent administration of these drugs does not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of each component. Both drugs are extensively metabolized by the liver, primarily by CYP3A4 (amlodipine) and CYP2C9 (irbesartan). Elimination is primarily via hepatic and renal routes for both components.
- **Mode of Action:** Amlodipine: Blocks L-type calcium channels. Irbesartan:  Blocks angiotensin II AT1 receptors.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Irbesartan binds to the AT1 receptor of Angiotensin II, blocking Angiotensin II binding and its downstream effects. Amlodipine blocks calcium channels, primarily impacting vascular smooth muscle.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism for both drugs, with subsequent renal and biliary excretion.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: One tablet of amlodipine/irbesartan (150 mg irbesartan/5 mg amlodipine or 150 mg irbesartan/10 mg amlodipine) once daily.
- Maintenance dose: Can be increased to a maximum of 300 mg irbesartan/10 mg amlodipine per day, based on individual blood pressure response.

#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy not established in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is generally required. However, start with the lowest dose and monitor closely.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is generally needed unless the patient is also volume-depleted.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Amlodipine should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Initiate at the lowest dose and titrate slowly.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with heart failure. For patients with diabetic nephropathy, the combination should not be used with ACE inhibitors.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Amlodipine/irbesartan's primary use is in the chronic management of hypertension.  It is not specifically indicated for acute situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations such as cardiac arrest.
