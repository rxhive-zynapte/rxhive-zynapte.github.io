## **Usage**

- Amlodipine + Metoprolol Succinate is prescribed for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure) and angina pectoris (chest pain). It is also used in the management of heart failure.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination drug includes a calcium channel blocker (Amlodipine) and a beta-blocker (Metoprolol Succinate).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Amlodipine works by relaxing the smooth muscles of the blood vessels, allowing them to dilate and reducing blood pressure. Metoprolol succinate blocks the effects of adrenaline on the heart and blood vessels, slowing the heart rate and further reducing blood pressure. Together, they provide a synergistic effect in managing hypertension and related conditions.

## **Alternate Names**

- While "Amlodipine + Metoprolol Succinate" is the standard generic name, variations may exist internationally.
- **Brand Names:** This combination is marketed under various brand names, including Actiblok AM, Angicam-M, and others.  Brand names can vary regionally.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Amlodipine causes vasodilation, reducing peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure. Metoprolol reduces heart rate, cardiac output, and renin release.  The combination has synergistic antihypertensive effects.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Amlodipine is well-absorbed orally and extensively metabolized by the liver. Metoprolol succinate is formulated as an extended-release medication, providing slow and sustained release. Both drugs are primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism, with a smaller portion excreted renally.
- **Mode of Action:** Amlodipine blocks calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle, inhibiting contraction and promoting vasodilation. Metoprolol is a beta-1 selective adrenergic receptor blocker, reducing sympathetic stimulation of the heart.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Amlodipine acts on L-type calcium channels. Metoprolol selectively antagonizes beta-1 adrenergic receptors.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Both drugs are primarily metabolized by the liver (CYP450 enzymes, particularly CYP3A4 for amlodipine) and excreted in the urine and bile.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: Typically Amlodipine 5 mg + Metoprolol Succinate 25 mg - 50 mg once daily.  The dose may be titrated upwards to Amlodipine 10 mg + Metoprolol Succinate 200mg based on patient response and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of Metoprolol Succinate is 400 mg per day.
- Administration: Oral, once daily, with or without food.  Swallow tablets whole; do not crush or chew.

#### **Children:**

- Limited data exist for pediatric use of this combination. Dosing should be individualized based on age, weight, and clinical condition under strict specialist supervision if used.  Safety and efficacy in children under 6 years haven't been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and titrate cautiously due to potential age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment may be required depending on the degree of impairment. Close monitoring of kidney function is essential.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Start with a lower dose due to reduced metabolism. Close monitoring of liver function is recommended.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Careful consideration is needed in patients with heart failure, diabetes, or peripheral vascular disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use/Emergency Situations:** Dosing in these situations is generally managed on a case-by-case basis under specialist guidance, often involving separate administration of amlodipine and metoprolol depending on the clinical scenario.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient response, renal or hepatic function, and other patient-specific factors.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Dizziness, headache, fatigue, edema (especially of the ankles and feet), flushing, and stomach pain.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Bradycardia (slow heart rate), hypotension (low blood pressure), worsening heart failure, bronchospasm (in patients with asthma or COPD), and allergic reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Potential long-term effects of this combination are not well-studied but may include metabolic changes and cardiovascular complications if blood pressure and heart rate are not adequately controlled.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Angioedema (swelling), severe hypotension, and life-threatening arrhythmias.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to amlodipine, metoprolol, or any component of the formulation.
- Severe bradycardia, second or third-degree heart block, sick sinus syndrome (unless a pacemaker is present), cardiogenic shock, and decompensated heart failure.
- Severe peripheral arterial disease.



## **Drug Interactions**

- Other antihypertensives, antiarrhythmics (e.g., digoxin, diltiazem, verapamil), antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine), antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole), antivirals (e.g., ritonavir), CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers, and alcohol.
- OTC drugs, including NSAIDs and some herbal supplements, may interact.
- Grapefruit juice can significantly increase amlodipine levels.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C. Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus.
- **Breastfeeding:** Metoprolol is excreted in breast milk.  Amlodipine may also be excreted in breast milk. The safety of this combination during breastfeeding is not established. Consider the risks and benefits, or use an alternative if necessary.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Amlodipine: Calcium channel blocker, vasodilator. Metoprolol: Beta-1 selective adrenergic blocker, reduces heart rate and contractility.
- **Side Effects:** Dizziness, headache, fatigue, edema, flushing, stomach pain, bradycardia, hypotension.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe bradycardia, heart block, cardiogenic shock, decompensated heart failure.
- **Drug Interactions:** Numerous drug interactions, including other antihypertensives, antiarrhythmics, antifungals.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; potential fetal risks. Excreted in breast milk.
- **Dosage:**  Adults: Start with Amlodipine 5 mg + Metoprolol 25-50 mg once daily, titrate as needed.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, heart rate, signs of heart failure, renal and hepatic function.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Amlodipine and Metoprolol are frequently combined for their synergistic effects in managing hypertension.  Sometimes, other antihypertensives like hydrochlorothiazide may be added if further blood pressure control is required.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG. Evaluate renal and hepatic function, especially in elderly patients.
- **Specific Populations (Pregnant Women/Breastfeeding Mothers/Children & Elderly/Menstruating Individuals):**  See above sections for specific details.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Limit alcohol intake. Smoking cessation is strongly advised. Regular exercise and a healthy diet are essential. Driving restrictions may be necessary if dizziness or fatigue occurs.
