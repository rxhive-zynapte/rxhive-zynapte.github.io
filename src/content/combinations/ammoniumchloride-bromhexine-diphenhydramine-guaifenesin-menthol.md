## **Usage**

- This combination medication is prescribed for the relief of cough and cold symptoms, including productive and dry coughs, nasal and chest congestion, sneezing, runny nose, and itchy, watery eyes.  It is also used to alleviate allergy symptoms such as hay fever and other upper respiratory allergies.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination drug containing expectorants (ammonium chloride, guaifenesin), mucolytic (bromhexine), antihistamine (diphenhydramine), and a topical anesthetic/cooling agent (menthol).
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination works by thinning and loosening mucus (ammonium chloride, guaifenesin, bromhexine), suppressing the cough reflex (diphenhydramine), and providing a cooling and soothing effect on irritated airways (menthol).

## **Alternate Names**

- No internationally recognized non-proprietary name exists for this specific five-component combination. Each ingredient has its own international non-proprietary name (INN): Ammonium Chloride, Bromhexine, Diphenhydramine, Guaifenesin, and Menthol.
- **Brand Names:**  Bendyl, Rexom Unizet and Tutolin, among others. Brand names can vary regionally.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ammonium chloride and guaifenesin increase respiratory tract secretions, making the mucus thinner and easier to expectorate.  Bromhexine breaks down the structure of mucus, further reducing its viscosity. Diphenhydramine acts as an antihistamine, blocking the effects of histamine which reduces allergic symptoms like sneezing and runny nose.  It also has antitussive effects, suppressing the cough reflex. Menthol provides a cooling sensation and acts as a mild local anesthetic, soothing irritated airways.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Ammonium Chloride:** Absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Some systemic absorption.
    - **Bromhexine:** Well-absorbed orally and undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver.
    - **Diphenhydramine:** Well-absorbed orally with significant first-pass metabolism in the liver. It is widely distributed and crosses the blood-brain barrier.
    - **Guaifenesin:** Rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
    - **Menthol:** Absorbed through mucous membranes and distributed locally.
- **Mode of Action:** Ammonium chloride and guaifenesin increase bronchial secretions, making the mucus watery. Bromhexine directly breaks down mucopolysaccharides in mucus. Diphenhydramine competitively inhibits the effects of histamine at H1 receptors.  Menthol activates TRPM8 receptors, leading to a cooling sensation.  
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal and hepatic.
