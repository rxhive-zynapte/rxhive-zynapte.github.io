## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the relief of cough and congestion associated with various respiratory tract infections and conditions, such as bronchitis, bronchial asthma, emphysema, and other bronchopulmonary disorders where bronchospasm, mucus plugging, and difficulty in expectoration coexist.  It combines drugs from different pharmacological classifications:

* **Ammonium Chloride:** Expectorant
* **Bromhexine:** Mucolytic
* **Menthol:** Cough suppressant, local anesthetic/counterirritant
* **Terbutaline:** Bronchodilator (Beta2-adrenergic agonist)

The medication works by thinning and loosening mucus (Bromhexine), making it easier to cough up (Ammonium Chloride), opening up the airways (Terbutaline), and soothing throat irritation (Menthol).

## **Alternate Names**

There are no officially recognized alternate names for this specific combination. However, it's crucial to recognize that it's a combination of four distinct drugs, each with their own alternate names:  Ammonium Chloride, Bromhexine Hydrochloride, Levomenthol, and Terbutaline Sulfate. This combination is marketed under various brand names, which vary depending on the manufacturer and region. Some examples include Tuspel Plus, Rhinil, Medler AF, Abokof BR, Broncorex, and Medkuff-BR.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Ammonium Chloride:** Increases respiratory tract fluid, reducing mucus viscosity.
* **Bromhexine:** Breaks down mucopolysaccharides, reducing mucus viscosity and promoting mucociliary clearance.
* **Menthol:** Activates cold receptors, causing a cooling sensation and relieving throat irritation.
* **Terbutaline:** Relaxes bronchial smooth muscle by stimulating beta-2 adrenergic receptors, leading to bronchodilation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** All components are absorbed orally.
* **Metabolism:**  Bromhexine is metabolized in the liver.  Terbutaline is primarily metabolized by conjugation. Information on the metabolism of ammonium chloride and menthol in this context is limited in the provided sources.
* **Elimination:** All components are primarily eliminated renally, either unchanged or as metabolites.  

## **Dosage**
