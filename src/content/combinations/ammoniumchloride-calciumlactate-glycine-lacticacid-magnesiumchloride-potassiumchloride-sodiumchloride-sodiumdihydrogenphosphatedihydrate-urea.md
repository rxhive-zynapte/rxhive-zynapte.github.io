## **Usage**

This topical medication is primarily used as a moisturizer to treat dry, rough, and chapped skin. It is indicated for conditions such as xerosis, ichthyosis, hyperkeratosis, eczema, psoriasis, and dermatitis. It can also provide relief from minor burns, insect bites, and diaper rash.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Topical emollient and humectant.

**Mechanism of Action:** Urea and lactic acid work synergistically. Urea is a humectant, drawing moisture into the skin and softening keratin. Lactic acid is both a keratolytic and humectant, exfoliating and moisturizing the skin.  The other ingredients provide additional moisturizing, soothing, and electrolyte support to the skin.


## **Alternate Names**

Ceracue Cream, Cotaryl Cream, Remoiz Cream.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  The cream primarily exerts its effects through the humectant and keratolytic properties of urea and lactic acid. Urea increases skin hydration by drawing water from the deeper layers of the skin and the atmosphere. Lactic acid promotes exfoliation by breaking down the bonds between dead skin cells, leading to smoother and softer skin. Additionally, lactic acid contributes to hydration. Other components like glycine, calcium lactate, magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium chloride, and sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate contribute to maintaining the skin's electrolyte balance and provide further moisturizing effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The cream is applied topically, and absorption is mainly localized to the application site. Minimal systemic absorption is expected with intact skin. However, with damaged or broken skin, some systemic absorption of urea may occur. Urea is primarily excreted renally, while lactic acid is metabolized in the liver.  The pharmacokinetics of other components are not clinically significant for topical application.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer to the affected area two to three times daily, or as directed by a physician. Gently massage until absorbed.


#### **Children:** Consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosing in children as safety and efficacy in pediatric patients haven't been extensively established.



#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised, and patients should be monitored for systemic absorption, particularly urea.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are necessary.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient needs and monitor for any adverse reactions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**
This cream is generally not used in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Allergic reactions, such as redness, swelling, or hives.



## **Contraindications**
