## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for symptomatic relief of cough and cold symptoms, particularly those associated with allergies.  It addresses multiple symptoms simultaneously due to its multi-component formulation.

**Pharmacological Classifications:**

* **Antihistamine (Cetirizine):** Reduces allergic symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes.
* **Cough Suppressant (Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide):**  Suppresses the cough reflex.
* **Expectorant (Ammonium Chloride):** Thins and loosens mucus, facilitating its expulsion.
* **Topical Analgesic/Counterirritant (Menthol):** Soothes throat irritation and provides a cooling sensation.
* **Zinc supplement (Zinc Gluconate):** May potentially reduce duration and severity of cold.


## **Alternate Names**

* Cromocet-DZ Syrup Mango
* Ariwa Syrup
* Other brand names may exist.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Cetirizine:**  A second-generation H1 receptor antagonist, it competitively inhibits histamine binding, reducing allergic manifestations.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:**  NMDA receptor antagonist to suppresses the cough reflex in the medulla.
* **Ammonium Chloride:**  Increases respiratory tract fluid, thinning mucus and aiding expectoration.  May also act as a weak acidifying agent.
* **Menthol:** Activates TRPM8 receptors causing a cooling sensation.  Also exerts mild local anesthetic and antitussive effects.
* **Zinc Gluconate:**  May interfere with viral replication, potentially affecting cold duration, though evidence is limited.


**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Cetirizine:**  Well-absorbed orally. Peak plasma concentrations reached in approximately 1 hour. Metabolized minimally.  Excreted primarily unchanged in urine.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:**  Readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6.  Excreted in urine as metabolites.
* **Ammonium Chloride:** Absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and excreted renally
* **Menthol:** Absorbed through skin and mucous membranes.  Metabolized in the liver. Excreted in urine and bile.
* **Zinc Gluconate:** Absorption and kinetics vary depending on the zinc salt and formulation, however the majority of zinc is excreted in the faeces.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* Typically, 5-10 ml of syrup every 4-6 hours as needed.  Maximum daily dose should not exceed 40 ml. This is a general guideline, always follow the prescribed dosage by a physician.

* Dosage is dependent on age and weight and should be determined by a physician. This combination is generally not recommended for children under 2 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary due to age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is necessary depending on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, and dose adjustment may be required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized assessment is essential, considering the patient's overall health status and potential drug interactions.
