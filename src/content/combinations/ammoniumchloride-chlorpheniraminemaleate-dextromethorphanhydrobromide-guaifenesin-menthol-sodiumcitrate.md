      How does this combination medication work for coughs?**


      **A:** It works through multiple mechanisms: thinning mucus (guaifenesin,

      making it easier to cough up phlegm (ammonium chloride). Menthol soothes
      throat irritation.

## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the relief of cough and upper respiratory symptoms, including nasal congestion, associated with the common cold or allergies.  It acts as an expectorant, making it easier to cough up phlegm.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing drugs from multiple classes:

* **Ammonium Chloride:** Expectorant
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:**  First-generation antihistamine (H1-receptor antagonist)
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:**  Cough suppressant (antitussive)
* **Guaifenesin:** Expectorant
* **Menthol:** Topical analgesic and decongestant
* **Sodium Citrate:** Mucolytic

## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication does not have a universally recognized international non-proprietary name (INN). It is often referred to by the names of its constituent drugs. Brand names may vary regionally; one example is  "Grilinctus" and "Rylocuf-D".

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Ammonium Chloride:** Increases respiratory tract fluid by irritating the gastric mucosa, stimulating reflex bronchial secretions and making it easier to expectorate.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:**  Blocks the action of histamine at H1 receptors, reducing allergic symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Suppresses the cough reflex by acting on the cough center in the medulla oblongata.
* **Guaifenesin:**  Increases respiratory tract fluid volume, loosening and thinning bronchial secretions.
* **Menthol:**  Activates cold-sensitive TRPM8 receptors, creating a cooling sensation and providing some relief from throat irritation and cough.  It also has mild decongestant properties.
* **Sodium Citrate:** Helps to loosen and break down thick mucus.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The individual components of this combination are absorbed orally and metabolized, primarily in the liver. Elimination is mostly via renal excretion. The specific pharmacokinetic parameters (absorption rate, half-life, bioavailability) may vary based on individual components and patient factors.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults and Children 12 Years and Older:**

* Typically, two teaspoonfuls (10 mL) every six hours.
* Do not exceed four doses in a 24-hour period.
