## **Usage**

- This combination medication is prescribed for the temporary relief of cough and upper respiratory symptoms (including nasal congestion) associated with the common cold, flu, or allergies.  It may also help loosen congestion in the chest and throat.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Expectorant, antihistamine, and cough suppressant.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination targets different aspects of cold and allergy symptoms. Ammonium chloride and guaifenesin act as expectorants, thinning and loosening mucus. Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine, blocking the effects of histamine, which reduces allergic reactions like runny nose and sneezing. Dextromethorphan hydrobromide suppresses coughs by acting on the cough center in the brain.

## **Alternate Names**

- While there isn't a universally recognized alternate name for this specific four-ingredient combination, it's sometimes referred to as a cough and cold combination or an expectorant and antihistamine combination.
- **Brand Names:**  Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region. Some examples include Dextrolag, Grilinctus, and various generic formulations.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ammonium chloride and guaifenesin increase respiratory tract fluids, making mucus less sticky and easier to expel. Chlorpheniramine maleate antagonizes histamine H1 receptors, reducing allergic symptoms. Dextromethorphan hydrobromide acts centrally in the medulla to elevate the cough threshold.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** The individual components are absorbed orally.  Metabolism primarily occurs in the liver (hepatic metabolism), and excretion is mainly through the kidneys (renal excretion).  
- **Mode of Action:** Ammonium chloride acts as a stimulant to the secretory glands in the respiratory tract.  Guaifenesin increases the output of respiratory tract fluid. Chlorpheniramine competes with histamine for H1-receptor sites on effector cells in the respiratory tract. Dextromethorphan hydrobromide suppresses the cough reflex by its effect on the central nervous system.
