## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of cough and cold symptoms, particularly those associated with allergies or the common cold.  It is also used to relieve chest congestion caused by excess mucus in the airways.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination drug includes components belonging to several classes:
    - Ammonium Chloride: Expectorant
    - Chlorpheniramine Maleate:  First-generation antihistamine (H1 receptor antagonist)
    - Guaifenesin: Expectorant
    - Sodium Citrate: Mucolytic

- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination works through the synergistic actions of its components:
    - Ammonium Chloride and Guaifenesin thin and loosen mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.
    - Chlorpheniramine Maleate blocks the action of histamine, reducing allergy symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.
    - Sodium Citrate also helps to thin the mucus, further aiding in its removal.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no single international non-proprietary name (INN) for this specific four-drug combination.  It is often identified by the names of its individual active ingredients.  Various brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region.  Some examples include (though not exhaustive):

- **Brand Names:** Kofril Expectorant,  Grilinctus, and various other regional brand names. Note that some brand names may contain additional active ingredients such as dextromethorphan or menthol.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The combined effect of this drug is to reduce cough, clear airways, and alleviate allergy symptoms.  Ammonium chloride and guaifenesin primarily act on the respiratory system by increasing hydration and reducing the viscosity of mucus secretions. Chlorpheniramine maleate acts systemically by blocking H1 histamine receptors, thereby counteracting the effects of histamine release in allergic reactions. Sodium citrate acts locally within the respiratory tract to break down mucus.


- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Absorption:  All components are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, though at varying rates.
    - Metabolism: Chlorpheniramine maleate is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP450 enzymes.  Ammonium chloride is metabolized in the liver to urea.  Guaifenesin and Sodium Citrate have minimal hepatic metabolism.
    - Elimination:  The metabolites of chlorpheniramine and the products of ammonium chloride metabolism are primarily excreted renally. Guaifenesin is also primarily excreted in the urine.


- **Mode of Action:** Ammonium chloride and guaifenesin act by increasing respiratory tract fluids, thereby reducing mucus viscosity.  Chlorpheniramine competitively binds to H1 histamine receptors, preventing histamine from exerting its effects. Sodium citrate directly breaks down mucoproteins in mucus.


- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Chlorpheniramine maleate competitively and reversibly binds to H1 histamine receptors. The other components do not have specific receptor binding or enzyme inhibition properties relevant to their therapeutic effects in this combination.

- **Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily renal excretion for all components after metabolism (where applicable).

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The typical adult dose varies depending on the specific formulation and brand.  Generally, 10ml of syrup every 4-6 hours is recommended. Always follow the prescribed dosage and consult the specific product information for details.

#### **Children:** Pediatric dosage is dependent upon age and weight. It is crucial to consult a pediatrician or refer to the specific product's pediatric dosage guidelines. This combination is generally not recommended for children under 6 years of age. Some formulations containing this combination are not recommended for children under 12 years of age.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Dose adjustments may be necessary due to age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose reduction is typically required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, and dose adjustments may be needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Careful consideration is necessary for patients with asthma, glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or other chronic illnesses.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is typically not used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU care. Its use is primarily limited to outpatient management of common cold and cough symptoms.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be required based on patient-specific factors like renal/hepatic impairment, age, and other medical conditions. Consult product-specific guidelines or an expert for adjustments in these populations.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Drowsiness
- Dizziness
- Dry mouth, nose, and throat
- Nausea
- Headache
- Constipation


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
- Difficulty breathing
- Paradoxical excitation (especially in children)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Generally not intended for long-term use. Prolonged use of chlorpheniramine can lead to tolerance and decreased effectiveness.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** See rare but serious side effects.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any of the components.
- Severe liver or kidney disease.
- Narrow-angle glaucoma.
- Urinary retention.
- Concurrent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).

## **Drug Interactions**

- Alcohol (increases sedation).
- Other CNS depressants (e.g., sedatives, hypnotics, opioids).
- Anticholinergic drugs (e.g., atropine).
- MAOIs.
- Medications metabolized by CYP450 enzymes.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Use with caution and only if clearly needed. The safety profile during pregnancy has not been firmly established.

- **Breastfeeding:**  Small, occasional doses may be acceptable, but prolonged use or higher doses are not recommended.  Chlorpheniramine is excreted in breast milk.  The non-sedating antihistamines are preferred if an antihistamine is necessary.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

## **Popular Combinations**

This combination itself is a popular combination for cough and cold relief.  Sometimes, dextromethorphan, a cough suppressant, is added for more comprehensive symptom control.  Other potential additions may include decongestants like phenylephrine.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess renal and hepatic function before initiating therapy. Screen for allergies.
- **Specific Populations:** See above.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid alcohol, as it can exacerbate drowsiness. Caution is advised while driving or operating machinery due to potential sedative effects.
