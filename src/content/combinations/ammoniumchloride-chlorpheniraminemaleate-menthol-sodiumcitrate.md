## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of cough due to minor throat and bronchial irritation, often associated with the common cold, flu, or allergies.  It also helps to relieve allergy symptoms such as runny nose, watery eyes, itching, and sneezing.  Pharmacologically, this is classified as a combination of an expectorant, antihistamine, and mucolytic agent.  The medication works by thinning mucus, suppressing cough, and reducing allergic responses.

## **Alternate Names**

While no specific international non-proprietary name (INN) exists for this exact combination, it may be referred to by various generic names based on the specific formulation. Brand names can vary significantly depending on the manufacturer and region. Some common brand names containing these ingredients include Kemodryl Cough Syrup, Cirohist Expectorant, Piriton Expectorant, and Koflyn Raspberry Flavour Cough Expectorant. Other formulations containing similar combinations include Cofkar Expectorant and KOLQ-PLUS Suspension.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Ammonium chloride acts as an expectorant by irritating the respiratory mucosa, stimulating increased fluid secretion and thereby thinning the mucus.  Chlorpheniramine maleate, an antihistamine, blocks H1 receptors, reducing histamine-mediated allergic reactions like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.  Menthol provides a soothing effect on the throat by stimulating cold receptors, also providing mild local anesthetic effects.  Sodium citrate acts as a mucolytic, breaking down mucus and making it less viscous, aiding in expectoration.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Ammonium chloride is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and metabolized in the liver, with excretion primarily via the kidneys. Chlorpheniramine maleate is well-absorbed orally, extensively metabolized in the liver (CYP450 enzymes), and eliminated through renal excretion.  Menthol is absorbed through the mucous membranes and skin, metabolized in the liver, and excreted in urine and feces. Sodium citrate is absorbed from the GI tract and is partially metabolized, with the remainder being excreted in urine.

## **Dosage**

The dosage guidelines provided here are general recommendations. It is crucial to follow physician-prescribed dosages and account for patient-specific factors.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Typically, 8-10 mL of syrup every 4-6 hours is recommended for adults, not exceeding the maximum daily limit.

#### **Children:**  Dosage for children should be based on age and weight, with formulations available tailored for pediatric use.  Consult medical references or pediatric dosing guides for precise recommendations.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Start with a lower dose due to potential age-related metabolic changes and renal/hepatic impairment. Close monitoring is advised.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment is crucial, factoring in creatinine clearance and renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dose reduction may be necessary due to decreased metabolic capacity.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider underlying conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and pulmonary disorders, adjusting dosage accordingly.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This specific drug combination is generally not indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are required for renal and hepatic dysfunction, also considering other metabolic disorders and potential drug interactions.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**  Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, constipation, headache, blurred vision, and gastrointestinal upset.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**  Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), difficulty breathing, confusion, hallucinations, and cardiovascular effects (e.g., palpitations).

### **Long-Term Effects:** Chronic use may increase the risk of dental caries with syrup formulations. Potential for dependence on the antihistamine component exists with prolonged use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Severe allergic reactions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis are rare but require immediate intervention.


## **Contraindications**

Absolute contraindications include hypersensitivity to any component of the medication, severe respiratory depression, angle-closure glaucoma, and concurrent use of MAO inhibitors. Relative contraindications include prostatic hypertrophy, bladder neck obstruction, asthma, and severe cardiovascular disease.


## **Drug Interactions**

This combination can interact with various medications, including MAO inhibitors, alcohol, CNS depressants (e.g., sedatives, opioids, barbiturates), antihypertensives, anticoagulants, and certain antibiotics. It's important to consider CYP450 enzyme interactions.  Menthol inhibits CYP3A4 and can interact with drugs metabolized by this enzyme. Concomitant use with other antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, should be avoided.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not well-established.  It is generally recommended to avoid use unless the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  Consult a physician to assess the risk-benefit ratio and consider alternative medications if necessary.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Expectorant, antihistamine, mucolytic, and soothing action.
- **Side Effects:** Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, MAOI use, severe respiratory depression.
- **Drug Interactions:** CNS depressants, MAOIs, certain antibiotics, alcohol.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult a physician; generally avoided.
- **Dosage:** Adult: 8-10 mL every 4-6 hours; pediatric dosing as per guidelines.

## **Popular Combinations**

This combination itself is a commonly used formulation.  However, some formulations might include additional ingredients like dextromethorphan for enhanced cough suppression or decongestants like phenylephrine.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Assess for allergies, renal/hepatic impairment, respiratory conditions, and drug interactions.
- **Specific Populations:**  Caution is advised in pregnant/breastfeeding women, children, and the elderly.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid alcohol and activities requiring alertness.
