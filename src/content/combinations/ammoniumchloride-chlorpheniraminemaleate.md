## **Usage**

Ammonium Chloride + Chlorpheniramine Maleate is prescribed for the relief of cough and cold symptoms, particularly those associated with allergies or respiratory infections.  This combination targets multiple symptoms like cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**
    - Ammonium Chloride: Expectorant
    - Chlorpheniramine Maleate: Antihistamine

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Ammonium chloride works by thinning and loosening mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up. Chlorpheniramine maleate blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during allergic reactions. This helps relieve allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes.


## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication doesn't have a specific international nonproprietary name (INN).  It is generally referred to by its constituent drug names.  Several brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and specific formulation.

- **Brand Names:**  (Note: Brand names vary regionally.  This is not an exhaustive list)
    -  Coscopin Linctus (when combined with Noscapine and Sodium Citrate)
    -  Koflyn (when combined with Sodium Citrate)
    -  Piriton Expectorant (when combined with Sodium Citrate)
    -  Fedalis Expectorant (when combined with Sodium Citrate)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ammonium chloride increases the water content of mucus, reducing its viscosity.  Chlorpheniramine maleate competitively antagonizes histamine at H1 receptors, reducing the effects of histamine release during an allergic response.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Both drugs are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
    - **Metabolism:**  Chlorpheniramine is primarily metabolized in the liver.  Ammonium chloride is converted to urea and hydrochloric acid.
    - **Elimination:**  Both drugs and their metabolites are primarily eliminated by the kidneys.

- **Mode of Action:** Ammonium chloride acts on the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract, irritating them and stimulating increased fluid secretion.  Chlorpheniramine blocks the binding of histamine to H1 receptors, preventing the cascade of events that lead to allergic symptoms.

- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Chlorpheniramine maleate binds to and blocks H1 histamine receptors.

- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for both drugs.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  10ml every 4-6 hours as needed. Do not exceed 40 ml in 24 hours.


#### **Children:**  Dosing varies depending on age and weight.  It is typically recommended for children over 6 years of age. Consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosing guidelines and ensure the formulation is suitable for children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Start with a lower dose and monitor closely for adverse effects. A dose reduction may be necessary.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment is necessary. Consult a nephrologist for specific recommendations.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment is necessary. Consult a hepatologist for specific recommendations.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with asthma, glaucoma, prostate problems, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or hyperthyroidism.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The Ammonium Chloride + Chlorpheniramine Maleate combination is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It is primarily indicated for outpatient management of cough and cold symptoms related to the common cold or allergies.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on patient factors such as age, renal function, and hepatic function. Consult specialist physicians (nephrologist, hepatologist, etc.) as needed for individualized dosing.
