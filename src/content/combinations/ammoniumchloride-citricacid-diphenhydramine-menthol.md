## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of coughs and nasal congestion associated with the common cold, flu, allergies, and other upper respiratory tract infections.  It is also used to relieve throat irritation.

Its pharmacological classifications include:
- Antitussive (Cough suppressant, specifically Diphenhydramine)
- Expectorant (Ammonium Chloride)
- Mucolytic (Citric Acid and Sodium Citrate, if present in the formulation)
- Demulcent/Soothing agent (Menthol)
- Antihistamine (Diphenhydramine)

The mechanism of action involves multiple components:
- Ammonium chloride increases respiratory tract secretions, thinning mucus and making coughs more productive.
- Citric acid stimulates throat mucous membranes, increasing blood flow and soothing soreness.
- Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine, blocks the effects of histamine, reducing allergy symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and coughing.
- Menthol provides a cooling sensation and mild local anesthetic effect, relieving throat irritation and cough.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no single international non-proprietary name (INN) for this combination product. It is often referred to by the names of its constituent ingredients. Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region. Some examples include Benylin Original, Coflax Cough Syrup, and others.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

- **Ammonium Chloride:** Acts as an expectorant by stimulating secretions in the respiratory tract. It also increases the pH of bronchial secretions which thins mucus. This facilitates easier expectoration.
- **Citric Acid:**  Acts as a mucolytic by breaking down thick mucus. Additionally, it can also be used as mild local anesthetic, increasing blood flow and soothing soreness.
- **Diphenhydramine:**  A first-generation antihistamine that competitively antagonizes the H1 histamine receptor.  This action reduces the effects of histamine, leading to decreased allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, watery eyes, and cough due to histamine release. It also has antitussive (cough suppressant) and sedative properties through its central nervous system effects.
- **Menthol:** Stimulates cold receptors in the mucous membranes, creating a cooling sensation and relieving irritation.  It also acts as a weak local anesthetic and mild cough suppressant.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

- **Absorption:** Orally administered, this combination is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract. 
- **Metabolism:** Diphenhydramine is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily via CYP2D6. The other ingredients are also metabolized, although the details may vary.
- **Elimination:**  The metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine.



## **Dosage**

Dosage guidelines vary by region, brand, and specific product formulation. Always consult the local product labeling and/or prescribing information.  The following represents general guidelines and some examples from various sources, and should not be used as the sole basis for dosing decisions.

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lower end of the adult dosage range. Close monitoring for side effects is recommended.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary. Monitor renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution and dose adjustment are advised due to diphenhydramine's hepatic metabolism.  Monitor liver function.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with asthma, COPD, glaucoma, prostate enlargement, urinary retention, cardiovascular disease, or hyperthyroidism.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This specific combination is generally not indicated for use in intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.
