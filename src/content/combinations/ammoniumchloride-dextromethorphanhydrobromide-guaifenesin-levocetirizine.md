## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the temporary relief of cough and congestion associated with the common cold, flu, or other upper respiratory allergies.  It is also effective in managing cough triggered by allergies.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Expectorant (Ammonium Chloride, Guaifenesin)
* Cough Suppressant (Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide)
* Antihistamine (Levocetirizine)

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination targets multiple symptoms simultaneously. Ammonium Chloride and Guaifenesin thin and loosen mucus, making it easier to cough up. Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide suppresses the cough reflex. Levocetirizine, a second-generation antihistamine, blocks histamine action, relieving allergy symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.


## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication doesn't have a universally recognized brand name. It is frequently identified by its constituent drugs. Some similar combinations containing different antihistamines (like chlorpheniramine) are marketed under various brand names, including *Zeet P*, *Nilcold-DM*, and *Supresmax LG*.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The combined action of the ingredients provides symptomatic relief from cough, mucus congestion, and allergic manifestations.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** All components are absorbed orally.
* **Metabolism:** Levocetirizine is primarily metabolized by the liver, and Dextromethorphan undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism via CYP2D6. Menthol is also metabolized in the liver. Ammonium chloride is not metabolized and is excreted unchanged.
* **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion for Ammonium Chloride and Levocetirizine.

**Mode of Action:**

* Ammonium Chloride and Guaifenesin increase respiratory tract fluids, reducing mucus viscosity.
* Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide acts on the cough center in the medulla oblongata, suppressing the cough reflex.
* Levocetirizine competitively inhibits histamine binding to H1 receptors.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  5-10ml syrup every 4-6 hours, not exceeding 40ml daily. Dosage can be adjusted based on symptom severity and individual response.

#### **Children:** Generally not recommended for children under 6. For older children, consult a healthcare professional for weight and age-based dosing.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Initiate with a lower dose and titrate as needed due to potential age-related renal and hepatic function decline.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Exercise caution and consider dosage reduction.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Avoid in severe liver disease. Adjust dose for mild to moderate impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful evaluation is required for patients with pre-existing medical conditions like respiratory conditions, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.

### **Common Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, headache, blurred vision, and restlessness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:** Allergic reactions (hives, angioedema, breathing difficulty), severe drowsiness/confusion, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizures.

### **Long-Term Effects:**  No significant long-term effects are expected with short-term use. Avoid prolonged usage unless medically supervised.

* Hypersensitivity to any component
* Concurrent MAO inhibitor use
