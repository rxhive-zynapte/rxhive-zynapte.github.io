## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of cough associated with allergies and the common cold.  It helps loosen and thin mucus in the airways, suppress the urge to cough, relieve allergy symptoms (like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes), and soothe irritated airways.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This drug is a combination product containing:

* **Expectorant** (Ammonium Chloride)
* **Cough Suppressant** (Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide)
* **Antihistamine** (Levocetirizine)
* **Decongestant/Topical Anesthetic** (Menthol)


## **Alternate Names**

While this specific combination may not have a widely recognized international non-proprietary name (INN), it's commonly found in various branded formulations. Regional variations in brand names are also common.  Some formulations might substitute Bromhexine for Ammonium Chloride. Brand names include: Nilcold-DM Syrup, Qmol-PD Syrup, and Zykuf D Syrup.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Ammonium Chloride:**  Acts as an expectorant by increasing respiratory tract fluid secretions, thus reducing mucus viscosity and making it easier to cough up.
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Suppresses the cough reflex by acting on the cough center in the medulla oblongata in the brain.
* **Levocetirizine:**  A second-generation antihistamine that blocks histamine H1 receptors. This action mitigates the allergic response, relieving symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, itching, and watery eyes.
* **Menthol:**  Produces a cooling sensation in the airways. It also acts as a mild local anesthetic, providing soothing relief to irritated airways.  Can also have mild decongestant properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** All components are absorbed orally.
* **Metabolism:**  Dextromethorphan is primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes.  Levocetirizine undergoes minimal metabolism.  Ammonium chloride and menthol are minimally metabolized.
* **Elimination:** Levocetirizine is primarily excreted unchanged in urine.  Dextromethorphan and its metabolites are excreted in urine. Ammonium Chloride is excreted in the urine. Menthol is primarily excreted in the urine and feces.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

5-10 ml syrup every 4-6 hours or as directed.  Tablet formulations, where available, may have different dosing instructions. Maximum daily dose of dextromethorphan should not exceed 120 mg.

#### **Children:**

Consult a healthcare professional for pediatric dosing as it varies based on age and weight. Generally, it's not recommended for children under 4 years old. Use with caution in children under 12 years old.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Start with a lower dose and monitor closely for adverse effects due to potential age-related decline in organ function.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Levocetirizine dosage needs to be adjusted based on creatinine clearance (CrCl):
    * CrCl 50-80 mL/min: 2.5 mg daily
    * CrCl 30-50 mL/min: 2.5 mg every other day
    * CrCl 10-30 mL/min: 2.5 mg twice a week
    * CrCl <10 mL/min or hemodialysis: Contraindicated

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution and monitor closely for adverse effects due to potential impaired metabolism. Dose adjustments may be necessary.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with persistent cough, cough accompanied by excessive mucus secretion, history of peptic ulcer disease, diabetes, hypertension, glaucoma, enlarged prostate gland, urinary retention, seizure disorders, and psychiatric disorders.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is not typically indicated for specific clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its usage is primarily for the symptomatic relief of cough and cold related to allergies and common cold.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be required in special populations (elderly, renally impaired, hepatically impaired) as mentioned above.  Adjustments may also be necessary based on patient-specific factors like drug interactions, concomitant medications, and other underlying medical conditions.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), hallucinations, respiratory depression, cardiac arrhythmias (rarely QT prolongation with levocetirizine, especially at higher doses or with drug interactions).

### **Long-Term Effects:**
Chronic use of dextromethorphan at high doses can lead to psychological dependence.


## **Contraindications**
