## **Usage**

This combination medication is used to treat symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, and other upper respiratory infections. It targets cough, nasal congestion, and minor throat irritation.  These combined ingredients address multiple symptoms simultaneously.

It's pharmacological classifications include:

* **Antitussive:** Dextromethorphan suppresses cough by acting on the cough center in the brain.
* **Decongestant:** Phenylephrine constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
* **Expectorant:** Ammonium chloride helps to loosen and thin mucus, making it easier to cough up.
* **Topical Anesthetic:** Menthol provides a cooling sensation that soothes minor throat irritation.


## **Alternate Names**

This specific combination may not have a universally recognized international non-proprietary name (INN). The individual components, however, do have their own INNs. This combination is often described by its constituent drugs. Brand names may vary depending on the manufacturer and region. Some common brand names include Piritexyl Cough Syrup.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Dextromethorphan:** Acts centrally on the medulla oblongata to suppress the cough reflex.
* **Phenylephrine:**  An alpha-adrenergic agonist, causing vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa, reducing congestion.
* **Ammonium chloride:** Increases respiratory tract fluid secretions, reducing mucus viscosity and aiding expectoration.
* **Menthol:** Activates TRPM8 receptors in the throat, creating a cooling sensation and relieving minor irritation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** All components are absorbed orally, although at varying rates.
* **Metabolism:** Dextromethorphan is primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes. Phenylephrine undergoes first-pass metabolism, and ammonium chloride is partially metabolized. Menthol is extensively metabolized.
* **Elimination:** Primarily through renal excretion, with some hepatic elimination for certain components.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  The usual dose is 5 mL (1 teaspoonful) every 4 to 6 hours, not to exceed 30 mL (6 teaspoonfuls) in 24 hours.

#### **Children:** Dosage for children under 12 years old should be determined based on the child's weight and age, and administered under strict medical supervision.  

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and monitor closely for adverse effects. Dose adjustments may be necessary based on renal function and other comorbid conditions.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment is required based on the degree of impairment. Consult resources for drug dosing in renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Dosage adjustments might be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with hypertension, heart disease, asthma, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, diabetes mellitus, and prostatic hypertrophy.



### **Clinical Use Cases**  This medication is primarily indicated for symptomatic relief of cough and congestion associated with common cold or flu.  It is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments** Dosage adjustments must be made for patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Considerations should include creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) for renal impairment, and Child-Pugh score for hepatic impairment. Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism should also be taken into account.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**
Nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, stomach upset, headache, restlessness, dizziness, drowsiness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), difficulty breathing, hallucinations, rapid or irregular heartbeat.

### **Long-Term Effects**
Chronic use of phenylephrine can lead to rebound congestion. Long-term use of dextromethorphan at high doses can rarely cause neurological problems.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**  Serious ADRs include severe allergic reactions, cardiac arrhythmias, and serotonin syndrome (with MAOI interaction).



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any of the components, severe hypertension, severe coronary artery disease, concurrent or recent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, peptic ulcer, asthma attack.


## **Drug Interactions**

MAOIs, alcohol, other CNS depressants (e.g., sedatives, hypnotics, opioids), tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers, antihypertensives, certain antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs).



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.  Use only if clearly needed and after careful consideration of risks and benefits. Phenylephrine may decrease milk production.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Combines antitussive, decongestant, expectorant, and topical anesthetic actions.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, rare but serious allergic reactions, cardiac issues.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, MAOI use, severe cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, urinary retention.
* **Drug Interactions:** MAOIs, CNS depressants, tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult a doctor before use; safety not fully established.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 5 mL every 4-6 hours, not to exceed 30 mL in 24 hours. Pediatric and special population dosing should be carefully determined.

## **Popular Combinations**

While this combination itself is common, additional ingredients are sometimes included, such as guaifenesin (another expectorant) or chlorpheniramine (an antihistamine).


## **Precautions**
Assess for pre-existing conditions, allergies, and concomitant medications. Caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, respiratory issues, and other chronic illnesses. Avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants. Advise against driving or operating heavy machinery until effects are known.
