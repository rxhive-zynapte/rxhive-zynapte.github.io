## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily used for the symptomatic relief of coughs associated with the common cold, flu, allergies, or other respiratory illnesses. It helps to relieve chest congestion, thin and loosen mucus, and suppress coughs.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This drug is a combination product and belongs to multiple classes: expectorant (ammonium chloride, terpin hydrate), antihistamine (diphenhydramine), mucolytic (sodium citrate), and demulcent (menthol).

**Mechanism of Action:**  Ammonium chloride and terpin hydrate increase respiratory tract secretions to thin and loosen mucus. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that reduces allergy symptoms like runny nose and sneezing, and also has a mild cough-suppressing effect. Sodium citrate helps to alkalinize and thin the mucus, while menthol provides a soothing effect on irritated airways.


## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication often goes by the names of its individual components. It doesn't typically have a single international nonproprietary name (INN). Some brand names for this combination include, but are not limited to: Geetuss, Qtuss, Lemolate Gold, Respy-TR, and X Kof. Availability can vary depending on the region.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ammonium chloride and terpin hydrate act as expectorants by irritating the respiratory tract, stimulating mucus production and making it easier to cough up. Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine, competitively antagonizes the H1 histamine receptor, reducing the effects of histamine release, such as runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes. It also has antitussive properties through central action. Sodium citrate alkalinizes the respiratory secretions, aiding in mucus clearance. Menthol has a mild local anesthetic and cooling action, providing a soothing effect to irritated mucous membranes.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Diphenhydramine is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentration in 2-3 hours. It is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6, and excreted in the urine. Ammonium chloride is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and excreted primarily by the kidneys. Terpin hydrate is absorbed orally and excreted in the urine. Sodium citrate is converted to bicarbonate in the body, which can affect the blood pH and promote mucus clearance. Menthol is absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes and is metabolized in the liver.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 5-10ml (one to two teaspoons) every 4-6 hours, as needed. Do not exceed 60 mL in 24 hours.

#### **Children:** Dosage should be determined by a pediatrician based on the child's weight and age. This combination is generally not recommended for children under 6 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and titrate upwards as needed due to age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment is necessary. Consult a nephrologist for specific recommendations.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment may be necessary. Consult a hepatologist for guidance.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, cardiovascular diseases, asthma, or chronic bronchitis. Dosage adjustment may be needed.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication is typically not used in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. It is intended for outpatient management of cough related to upper respiratory tract infections.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on factors such as age, weight, renal and hepatic function, and coexisting medical conditions.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Drowsiness
