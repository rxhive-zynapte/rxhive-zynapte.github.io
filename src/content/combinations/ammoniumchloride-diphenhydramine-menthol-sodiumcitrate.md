## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of cough and nasal congestion associated with the common cold, flu, allergies, or other respiratory illnesses like bronchitis.  It helps to loosen and thin mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up. It also suppresses cough and soothes irritated throat tissues.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Expectorant, antihistamine, antitussive, mucolytic, and demulcent.

## **Alternate Names**
- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific four-component combination. However, each individual component has its own respective generic and brand names.
- **Brand Names:** Numerous brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region (e.g., Benadryl Original (containing diphenhydramine and ammonium chloride), Abacoff, Stopkof, Histalix).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ammonium chloride works as an expectorant by stimulating secretions in the respiratory tract, thinning the mucus.  Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine, blocks the action of histamine, reducing allergy symptoms like coughing and sneezing. It also has a central nervous system depressant effect, providing a mild sedative and antitussive action. Menthol acts as a demulcent, soothing the throat.  Sodium citrate acts as a mucolytic by making mucus less viscous and acidic.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**  All components are absorbed orally. Diphenhydramine is metabolized primarily in the liver via the CYP2D6 enzyme system. Ammonium chloride is converted to ammonia and hydrochloric acid. The metabolic pathways for menthol and sodium citrate are less crucial for this combination's clinical effects. Renal excretion plays a role in the elimination of all components and their metabolites.
