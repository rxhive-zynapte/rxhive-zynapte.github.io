## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of cough associated with the common cold, bronchitis, and other upper respiratory tract infections. It helps to loosen and thin mucus (expectorant), suppress cough (antitussive), and alleviate allergy symptoms (antihistamine).
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Expectorant, Antitussive, Antihistamine, Mucolytic, Topical Anesthetic.

## **Alternate Names**
-  This specific combination may not have a universally recognized alternate name. However, each ingredient has its own generic name as noted above. Many regional variations of the name may exist in cough syrup.  
- **Brand Names:**  Several brand names exist depending upon the region. Some example include Histalix, Abacoff, Benadryl Original, Difenacol, Diphal Expectorant and Stopkof.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ammonium chloride acts as an expectorant by stimulating secretions and reducing mucus viscosity. Diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine that blocks histamine H1 receptors, reducing allergic symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes. It also has antitussive and sedative properties. Menthol provides a cooling sensation and acts as a mild local anesthetic and decongestant.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Diphenhydramine and menthol are well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Ammonium chloride is absorbed quickly into the bloodstream and converted to ammonia and hydrochloric acid in the liver. Sodium citrate gets absorbed into the bloodstream from the gut.
    - **Metabolism:** Diphenhydramine is metabolized primarily in the liver via CYP2D6. Menthol is metabolized in the liver.  Ammonium chloride gets converted to ammonia and hydrochloric acid. Sodium Citrate gets metabolized to sodium bicarbonate.
    - **Elimination:** Diphenhydramine and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Menthol is excreted in the urine and bile. Ammonium chloride is primarily eliminated through the kidneys. Sodium citrate is primarily eliminated by the kidneys.
