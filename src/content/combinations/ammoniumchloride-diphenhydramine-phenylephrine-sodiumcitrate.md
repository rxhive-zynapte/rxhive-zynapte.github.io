## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily used for the symptomatic relief of cough and cold symptoms, including nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, and cough.  It is also sometimes used to relieve allergy symptoms.  Pharmacologically, this drug is classified as a combination of an antihistamine, a decongestant, an expectorant, and a mucolytic. The combined action of these components thins and loosens mucus, reduces nasal congestion, and suppresses cough.

## **Alternate Names**

No commonly used alternate names or international variations are listed in the provided sources for this specific four-component combination. Brand names may vary depending on the manufacturer and region. However, this exact combination is not commonly listed as a single product with a brand name in the sources provided. It's more common to find these ingredients combined with other drugs, such as paracetamol or menthol, under various brand names. These sources provide several brand names for similar combination products, but not for this precise combination.



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Ammonium chloride:** Acts as an expectorant by irritating the respiratory mucosa, stimulating mucus production and thinning the existing mucus, making it easier to cough up.
* **Diphenhydramine:** An antihistamine that blocks the effects of histamine, reducing allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes. It also has antitussive and sedative properties.
* **Phenylephrine:** A decongestant that constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing nasal congestion.
* **Sodium Citrate:** Acts as a mucolytic and alkalizing agent, helping to break down mucus and making it easier to expel. It increases the pH of body fluids, which may improve oxygen delivery.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  All components are absorbed orally.
* **Metabolism:** Diphenhydramine is primarily metabolized in the liver by the CYP450 system.  The metabolism pathways for the other components are less clearly defined in these sources.
* **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion for all components, though some may also undergo hepatic excretion.

**Mode of Action:**

* Diphenhydramine competitively antagonizes histamine at H1 receptors.
* Phenylephrine acts as an alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist.
* Ammonium chloride and sodium citrate exert their effects through physicochemical actions on mucus.
