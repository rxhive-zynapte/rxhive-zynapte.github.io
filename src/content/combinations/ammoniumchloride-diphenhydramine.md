## **Usage**

- Ammonium Chloride + Diphenhydramine is prescribed for the relief of cough and cold symptoms, including runny nose, sneezing, watery eyes, and sore throat. It is particularly effective for dry, raspy coughs.  It can also provide relief from allergies.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Expectorant (Ammonium Chloride) and Antihistamine (Diphenhydramine). This combination belongs to the class of cough and cold products.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Ammonium Chloride works by thinning and loosening mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.  Diphenhydramine blocks the action of histamine, a chemical mediator that causes allergic reactions. It also has antitussive (cough-suppressing) properties that act centrally in the brain.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate generic names exist for this specific combination product. The individual components may be referred to as diphenhydramine hydrochloride and ammonium chloride.
- **Brand Names:**  Brand names vary depending on the region and manufacturer.  Some examples include Benadryl Original, Biochemdryl, Stopkof, and Histalix, as well as other generic formulations like Bactidol Itchy Cough Relief.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ammonium Chloride increases respiratory tract secretions, reducing mucus viscosity and facilitating expectoration. Diphenhydramine antagonizes histamine H1 receptors, mitigating allergic symptoms.  It also acts centrally to suppress cough.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Diphenhydramine is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentration in 1-4 hours. It is metabolized extensively in the liver and excreted mainly in urine.  Ammonium Chloride is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Ammonium ions play a crucial role in acid-base balance, primarily through renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** Diphenhydramine competitively inhibits histamine at H1 receptors, thereby reducing the effects of histamine release in allergic responses. It also interacts with muscarinic cholinergic receptors, causing some anticholinergic effects.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Diphenhydramine competitively binds to H1 histamine receptors.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Diphenhydramine is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine. Ammonium Chloride is eliminated mainly through renal excretion.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 10 mL (or as directed on product label) every 4-6 hours as needed. Do not exceed 6 doses in a 24 hour period.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment.  Closely monitor renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment may be required based on the severity of liver dysfunction. Monitor liver function tests.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with asthma, glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, and other chronic lung conditions.
