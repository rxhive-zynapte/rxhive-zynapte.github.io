## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily used for the symptomatic relief of cough, particularly productive coughs associated with the common cold, bronchitis, and other respiratory tract infections.  It may also provide relief from allergy symptoms such as runny nose and sneezing.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antitussive (Methdilazine), Expectorant (Ammonium Chloride), Mucolytic (Sodium Citrate)

- **Mechanism of Action:**
    - **Methdilazine:** A first-generation antihistamine that blocks histamine H1 receptors, reducing inflammation in the airways and suppressing the cough reflex. It also has sedative properties.
    - **Ammonium Chloride:** Acts as an expectorant by increasing the water content in respiratory secretions, thinning the mucus, and facilitating its expulsion. In the body, it is converted into ammonia and hydrochloric acid, aiding in clearing the airways.
    - **Sodium Citrate:** Acts as a mucolytic and alkalizing agent. It thins the mucus, making it easier to cough up, and reduces acidity in the blood and urine, maintaining pH balance.

## **Alternate Names**

- Dilosyn Expectorant
- Rivdol Cough

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  The combined effects of methdilazine, ammonium chloride, and sodium citrate offer synergistic relief from cough. Methdilazine suppresses the cough reflex, while ammonium chloride and sodium citrate work together to thin and loosen mucus, making it easier to expectorate.  This combined action addresses both the urge to cough and the difficulty in clearing mucus.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Methdilazine:**  Limited information is available on the precise pharmacokinetics of methdilazine. As a first-generation antihistamine, it is likely well-absorbed orally and metabolized in the liver.
    - **Ammonium Chloride:** Absorbed readily from the gastrointestinal tract.  Metabolized in the liver to urea with the liberation of hydrogen and chloride ions.
    - **Sodium Citrate:** Absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and metabolized to sodium bicarbonate.

- **Mode of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Methdilazine acts as a histamine H1 receptor antagonist. Ammonium chloride and sodium citrate exert their effects through osmotic action and alteration of mucus viscosity, respectively.  No direct enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation is known for this combination.

- **Elimination Pathways:**  Ammonium chloride is eliminated primarily through renal excretion as urea and chloride ions. Sodium citrate is also eliminated renally as bicarbonate.  The elimination pathway of methdilazine is primarily hepatic.

## **Dosage**

Dosage depends on individual patient factors. Always consult product labeling. The following is for general guidance only:

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  5-15 ml of syrup (containing specified amounts of each ingredient per 5 ml) every 4-6 hours, as needed. Do not exceed the maximum daily dose indicated on the product labeling.

#### **Children:** Dosage is determined by the child's weight or age and according to pediatric dosing recommendations.  Generally, a lower dose and/or less frequent administration is appropriate for younger children. Specifically:
- **2-12 years old:** 8 ml every four hours, for up to seven days.
- **Above 6 years old:** Up to 15 ml every four hours, for up to seven days.
- **Children 1-5 Years:** 2.5ml every 4 hours.
- **Children 6-12 years:** 5ml every 4 hours.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lowest effective dose and monitor for side effects. Adjust dosage based on renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution and reduce the dose as needed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments may be necessary. Monitor for adverse effects.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate potential drug interactions. Use cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or other metabolic disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is typically used for outpatient management of cough symptoms and is not generally indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjust dosages based on individual patient factors, including renal and hepatic function, and comorbid conditions. Consult product labeling for specific adjustments.
