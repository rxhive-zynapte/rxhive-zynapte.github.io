## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of dry cough caused by minor throat and bronchial irritation. It's also used to manage coughs associated with the common cold, flu, post-nasal drip, bronchitis, chest congestion, and coughs related to inhaled irritants.
- **Pharmacological Classification**:  Antitussive (Noscapine), Expectorant (Ammonium Chloride), and Mucolytic agent (Sodium Citrate).
- **Mechanism of Action**:  Ammonium chloride works by irritating the bronchial mucosa, stimulating mucus production and thinning the existing mucus, making it easier to cough up. Noscapine suppresses the cough reflex by acting centrally on the medullary cough center in the brain. Sodium citrate alkalinizes and thins the mucus, further facilitating expectoration.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination.
- **Brand Names:**  Coscopin, Coscopin Plus, Coscopin Linctus,  Coscopin Paediatric,  Coupress N, Gocosco, and others (availability may vary by region).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Ammonium chloride increases the water content of the mucus, making it less viscous. Noscapine acts on sigma receptors in the central nervous system to suppress the cough reflex. Sodium citrate increases the pH of mucus, reducing its viscosity.
- **Pharmacokinetics**: All three components are absorbed orally.  Metabolism and elimination pathways are not fully elucidated for this specific combination, but generally, Ammonium Chloride is excreted renally, Noscapine is metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and bile, and Sodium Citrate is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.
- **Mode of Action**: Ammonium chloride acts on bronchial glands.  Noscapine is a sigma-receptor agonist in the CNS.  Sodium citrate increases pH through its citrate component. 
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition**: Specific receptor interactions or enzyme inhibitions beyond the sigma receptor activity of Noscapine aren't well-characterized for this combination.
- **Elimination Pathways**: Primarily renal excretion (Ammonium Chloride, Sodium Citrate) and hepatic metabolism followed by renal and biliary excretion (Noscapine).


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults**:
- Standard dose varies by formulation; typically 5-10 ml of syrup every 4-6 hours. Consult specific product labeling. Maximum daily dosage should not exceed recommendations on the packaging.
