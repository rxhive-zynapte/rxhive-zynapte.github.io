## **Usage**

- Amodiaquine + Artesunate is prescribed for the **treatment of acute, uncomplicated *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria**, including cerebral malaria. It is also indicated for uncomplicated malaria due to other *Plasmodium* species when chloroquine is ineffective.  It can also be used for completion treatment following parenteral therapy for severe malaria. It is particularly valuable in regions where *P. falciparum* has developed resistance to chloroquine.  It is **not** recommended for malaria prophylaxis.

- **Pharmacological classification:** Antimalarial (artemisinin-based combination therapy or ACT)

- **Mechanism of action:** This combination employs two distinct mechanisms to combat malaria. Artesunate, an artemisinin derivative, generates reactive oxygen species within the parasite, leading to damage of parasitic proteins and ultimately cell death. Amodiaquine, a 4-aminoquinoline, inhibits heme polymerization, a crucial process for parasite survival.  This dual action enhances efficacy and reduces the risk of resistance development.

## **Alternate Names**

- ASAQ
- Artesunate-amodiaquine

- **Brand Names:**  ASAQ Winthrop, Camoquin, Artesdiaquine


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Artesunate is rapidly metabolized to dihydroartemisinin, its active metabolite. Both artesunate and dihydroartemisinin exert their antimalarial effects by producing free radicals that damage parasitic proteins and other biomolecules. Amodiaquine interferes with heme detoxification within the parasite, leading to toxic heme accumulation.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Artesunate is rapidly absorbed and converted to dihydroartemisinin. Both compounds have short half-lives. Amodiaquine is well absorbed orally. It is metabolized primarily by CYP2C8 to desethylamodiaquine, an active metabolite.  Amodiaquine can accumulate in the liver. Elimination pathways are not fully characterized but involve both hepatic and renal routes.

- **Mode of action:**  Artesunate acts through the generation of reactive oxygen species, leading to oxidative stress and damage to parasite cellular components. Amodiaquine inhibits heme polymerase, disrupting heme detoxification and causing toxic heme buildup within the parasite.

- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**  The primary mechanism involves free radical generation (artesunate) and heme polymerase inhibition (amodiaquine). Limited information exists on receptor binding or neurotransmitter modulation.

- **Elimination pathways:** Both hepatic and renal excretion are involved.  CYP2C8 plays a role in amodiaquine metabolism.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  The standard dosage is based on a total dose of 12 mg/kg artesunate and 25-35 mg/kg amodiaquine base over three days.  This translates to a daily dose of 4 mg/kg artesunate and 10 mg/kg (7.5-15mg/kg range) amodiaquine base, administered once daily for three days.

#### **Children:** Pediatric dosing is weight-based, with the same daily and total dose as for adults (4 mg/kg artesunate and 10 mg/kg amodiaquine base, administered once daily for three days).  For very young children unable to swallow tablets, the tablets can be crushed and mixed with a small amount of food or liquid for immediate consumption.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are routinely recommended, but careful monitoring is advised.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No data available on dosing adjustments. Use with caution.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No data available on dosing adjustments. Use with caution and monitor liver function.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with cardiac disease, a history of ventricular dysrhythmias, or those taking medications that prolong the QT interval.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of artesunate and amodiaquine is **not** routinely indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or specific emergency situations outside of malaria treatment.  



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications might be necessary for renal/hepatic impairment, though specific guidelines are lacking. Consult official treatment guidelines and exercise caution.
