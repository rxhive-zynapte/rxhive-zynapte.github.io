## **Usage**

Amorolfine + Phenoxyethanol is prescribed for fungal skin and nail infections, including:

*   Athlete's foot (Tinea pedis)
*   Jock itch (Tinea cruris)
*   Ringworm (Tinea corporis)
*   Onychomycosis (fungal nail infections)
*   Cutaneous candidiasis
*   Pityriasis versicolor

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antifungal

**Mechanism of Action:** Amorolfine inhibits ergosterol biosynthesis, a critical component of fungal cell membranes. This disruption alters membrane permeability, affecting fungal metabolic processes and causing fungal cell death.  Phenoxyethanol acts as a preservative in the cream formulation.

## **Alternate Names**

Some alternate names include Amrobrut Cream, Amoron Cream, Emrolfin Cream, Fungicros Cream, Amortas Cream, and PAMORIA Cream.  Brand names can vary regionally.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Amorolfine exerts its antifungal effect by targeting ergosterol biosynthesis in fungal cell membranes. By inhibiting the enzymes Δ14-reductase and Δ7-Δ8-isomerase, it depletes ergosterol, leading to altered membrane permeability and function. This disruption ultimately results in fungal cell death. Phenoxyethanol acts as a preservative, preventing microbial contamination of the cream.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Amorolfine applied topically penetrates the stratum corneum and reaches therapeutic concentrations in the target tissues (skin and nails).  Systemic absorption is minimal, reducing the risk of systemic side effects.  The primary route of elimination for the small amount absorbed systemically is hepatic metabolism followed by renal excretion.  The pharmacokinetic profile of Phenoxyethanol following topical application as a preservative in the cream is not clinically significant due to the low concentrations used and minimal systemic absorption.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer of the cream to the affected area(s) once daily, preferably at bedtime, after cleansing and thoroughly drying the area.

#### **Children:** Use in children under 12 years of age is generally not recommended unless specifically advised by a pediatrician, as safety and efficacy haven't been fully established. Some sources recommend avoiding use in children under 3.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be needed depending on the severity of impairment. Monitor renal function.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised; dosage adjustments may be necessary. Monitor liver function tests.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider potential drug interactions and adjust treatment accordingly.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Amorolfine + Phenoxyethanol cream is intended for topical use only and is not suitable for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be required in cases of renal or hepatic impairment, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism. Consult specialized resources for specific recommendations.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Local skin irritation (e.g., burning, itching, redness)
*   Dryness
*   Contact dermatitis (rarely)



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Allergic reactions (e.g., rash, hives, angioedema) - discontinue use immediately and seek medical attention.



### **Long-Term Effects:** Prolonged use may lead to increased risk of contact dermatitis or fungal resistance.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Severe allergic reactions are the most significant ADR and warrant immediate discontinuation of the medication and medical intervention.

## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to amorolfine, phenoxyethanol, or any component of the formulation.

## **Drug Interactions**

Clinically significant drug interactions with topical Amorolfine + Phenoxyethanol cream are unlikely due to minimal systemic absorption.  No specific studies have investigated drug interactions with topical Amorolfine + Phenoxyethanol cream.  It is advisable to inform the physician about all concomitant medications, including topical and systemic drugs.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be avoided unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus or infant.  Limited data is available on the safety of amorolfine and phenoxyethanol in pregnancy and lactation.  Consult specialist resources or maternal-fetal medicine experts for guidance.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:**  Inhibits ergosterol biosynthesis, disrupting fungal cell membrane integrity.
*   **Side Effects:** Local skin irritation, dryness, rarely contact dermatitis or allergic reaction.
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to components.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Clinically significant interactions with topical application are unlikely.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Avoid unless potential benefit outweighs risk.  Consult specialist resources.
