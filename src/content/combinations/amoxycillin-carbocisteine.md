## **Usage**

Amoxycillin + Carbocisteine is prescribed for respiratory tract infections, particularly those associated with excessive mucus (phlegm) production, such as acute and chronic bronchitis.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Amoxycillin: Beta-lactam antibiotic
* Carbocisteine: Mucolytic

**Mechanism of Action:**  Amoxycillin, a penicillin-like antibiotic, inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death. Carbocisteine reduces the viscosity of mucus by breaking down disulphide bonds in mucoproteins, facilitating expectoration.

## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination. However, it is crucial to differentiate this combination from similar ones, such as Amoxycillin + Clavulanate (co-amoxiclav) or Amoxycillin + Bromhexine.

**Brand Names:**  Brand names vary regionally. Some examples include Carbomox, Muconal, and Cismox, but the availability of specific brand names depends on the region.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Amoxycillin exerts bactericidal effects by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, primarily affecting Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria. Carbocisteine alters the structure of mucus glycoproteins, thereby decreasing its viscosity and promoting clearance from the respiratory tract.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Amoxycillin:**  Well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1-2 hours. It distributes widely in body tissues and fluids, including the lungs and bronchial secretions.  Primarily excreted renally.
* **Carbocisteine:** Readily absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma levels in 1-2 hours.  It is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in urine.

**Mode of Action:**  Amoxycillin binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) on bacterial cell membranes, disrupting peptidoglycan synthesis and weakening the cell wall. Carbocisteine disrupts disulphide bonds in mucus, making it less viscous.


**Elimination Pathways:** Amoxycillin is eliminated primarily by renal excretion.  Carbocisteine is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in urine.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  A common dosage is 500 mg amoxycillin and 150 mg carbocisteine, taken three times daily. The dosage and duration of treatment can vary depending on the severity and type of infection.

#### **Children:**  The dosage for children is generally weight-based. A common regimen is 20-40 mg/kg/day of amoxycillin, divided into three doses, in combination with carbocisteine, adjusted according to the child's age and the specific product formulation. Pediatric use should be carefully monitored.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary in elderly patients with reduced renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is often needed based on creatinine clearance levels.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Carbocisteine metabolism may be affected; hence dosage adjustments should be considered.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  No specific dosage adjustments are universally established for comorbid conditions like diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Treat each case individually.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Amoxycillin + Carbocisteine is not typically indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary role is in the management of respiratory tract infections.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be necessary for patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, based on the severity of impairment and individual patient response.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, rash, headache, dizziness, drowsiness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:** Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis, angioedema), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, blood dyscrasias, seizures.

### **Long-Term Effects:** Potential for *Clostridium difficile* - associated diarrhea with prolonged antibiotic use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Anaphylaxis, angioedema, severe skin reactions require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to penicillin or cephalosporins.
* History of severe allergic reaction to carbocisteine.
* Active peptic ulcer disease.
* Severe renal impairment (for carbocisteine).


## **Drug Interactions**

* Allopurinol:  Increased risk of rash.
* Oral contraceptives: May reduce efficacy of oral contraceptives.
* Probenecid: May increase amoxycillin levels.
* Anticoagulants: Amoxycillin may enhance the effect of warfarin.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Amoxycillin is generally considered safe during pregnancy (Pregnancy Category B). Carbocisteine should be used with caution and only if clearly needed during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester.  Both drugs are excreted in breast milk. Monitor infants for potential side effects, such as diarrhea or thrush.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Amoxycillin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, carbocisteine reduces mucus viscosity.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, diarrhea, rash, allergic reactions (rarely severe).
* **Contraindications:** Penicillin allergy, active peptic ulcer, severe renal impairment (carbocisteine).
* **Drug Interactions:**  Allopurinol, oral contraceptives, probenecid, anticoagulants.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe, but use with caution and monitor infant.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 500 mg amoxycillin + 150 mg carbocisteine TDS. Pediatric: weight-based dosing.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Observe for signs of infection resolution, monitor for adverse effects, assess renal function if needed.


## **Popular Combinations**

While amoxycillin is often combined with clavulanate or bromhexine, combining it with other mucolytics beyond carbocisteine is less common. Always assess the individual patient's needs and potential drug interactions when considering combination therapy.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:**  Assess for penicillin allergy. Renal and hepatic function should be monitored, especially in elderly patients and those with pre-existing conditions.

* **Specific Populations:** Use with caution in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Monitor infants for diarrhea and thrush.

* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Alcohol doesn't directly interact but may exacerbate gastrointestinal side effects. No specific dietary restrictions.
