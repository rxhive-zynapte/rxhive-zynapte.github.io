      **A:** Amoxicillin and clarithromycin are antibiotics that work together
      to eradicate H. pylori. Pantoprazole reduces stomach acid to promote ulcer
      healing and create an environment unfavorable for *H. pylori* growth.

## **Usage**

This triple therapy is prescribed for the treatment of *Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)* infections and duodenal ulcers caused by this bacteria. Eradicating *H. pylori* reduces the risk of ulcer recurrence.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Amoxicillin: Beta-lactam antibiotic
* Clarithromycin: Macrolide antibiotic
* Pantoprazole: Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination targets *H. pylori* through multiple mechanisms. Amoxicillin disrupts bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial death. Clarithromycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, halting bacterial growth. Pantoprazole suppresses gastric acid secretion, creating a less acidic environment that is unfavorable for *H. pylori* and promotes ulcer healing.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no single international non-proprietary name (INN) for this combination. It's typically referred to by the constituent drug names.

**Brand Names:** Several brand names exist depending on the region and manufacturer.  Some examples include Pylera and Prevpac (containing lansoprazole instead of pantoprazole).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Amoxicillin exerts a bactericidal effect by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in the bacterial cell wall, inhibiting peptidoglycan synthesis and causing cell lysis. Clarithromycin binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit, inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. Pantoprazole irreversibly binds to the H+/K+-ATPase pump (proton pump) in gastric parietal cells, blocking gastric acid secretion.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Amoxicillin is well-absorbed orally, achieving peak plasma concentrations within 1-2 hours.  It's primarily excreted renally. Clarithromycin is also well-absorbed orally, with metabolism occurring in the liver and excretion through bile and urine. Pantoprazole is acid-labile and formulated as enteric-coated tablets. It is extensively metabolized by CYP450 enzymes in the liver, with renal excretion of metabolites.

**Mode of Action:**  See pharmacodynamics above.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**  Amoxicillin targets PBPs. Clarithromycin targets the 50S ribosomal subunit. Pantoprazole inhibits H+/K+-ATPase.


**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for amoxicillin. Hepatic metabolism and biliary/renal excretion for clarithromycin. Hepatic metabolism (CYP450 enzymes) and renal excretion of metabolites for pantoprazole.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

A common regimen is:

* Amoxicillin: 1 gram twice daily
* Clarithromycin: 500 mg twice daily
* Pantoprazole: 40 mg twice daily

This regimen is typically administered for 7-14 days.


#### **Children:**

This triple therapy is generally not recommended for children due to limited safety and efficacy data. Alternative therapies are preferred.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be needed based on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment of amoxicillin may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustments of clarithromycin and pantoprazole may be necessary. Monitor liver function.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration is required for patients with cardiac conditions, particularly those at risk of QT prolongation.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

The primary clinical use case is the eradication of *H. pylori* and associated duodenal ulcers.  The dosage is the same as the standard adult dosage mentioned above. This triple therapy is not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

See "Special Cases" above.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, diarrhea, headache, metallic taste disturbance, abdominal discomfort.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* *Clostridium difficile* infection
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
* QT prolongation


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term use is generally avoided due to the risk of antibiotic resistance and adverse effects.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  See "Rare but Serious Side Effects."



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any of the components (penicillins, macrolides, PPIs)
* History of cholestatic jaundice or hepatic dysfunction associated with clarithromycin
* Concomitant use with cisapride, pimozide, terfenadine, ergotamine, or dihydroergotamine
* Severe hepatic impairment


## **Drug Interactions**

* Warfarin: Clarithromycin can enhance the anticoagulant effect.
* Statins: Clarithromycin can increase statin levels, raising the risk of rhabdomyolysis.
* Digoxin: Clarithromycin can increase digoxin levels.
* Certain antiarrhythmics: Clarithromycin may increase the risk of QT prolongation.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Amoxicillin is considered relatively safe during pregnancy. Clarithromycin and pantoprazole have limited data in pregnancy. Consult a healthcare professional to assess the risks and benefits. Amoxicillin and clarithromycin are excreted in breast milk.  Pantoprazole has minimal excretion. Caution is advised during breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Amoxicillin inhibits cell wall synthesis; Clarithromycin inhibits protein synthesis; Pantoprazole inhibits gastric acid secretion.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, diarrhea, headache, metallic taste disturbance, abdominal discomfort; rarely, allergic reactions, *C. difficile* infection, hepatotoxicity, QT prolongation.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, history of clarithromycin-induced jaundice/hepatic dysfunction, concomitant use with certain drugs (cisapride, pimozide, etc.), severe hepatic impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Warfarin, statins, digoxin, certain antiarrhythmics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult a healthcare professional for guidance.
* **Dosage:** Adults: Amoxicillin 1g BID, Clarithromycin 500mg BID, Pantoprazole 40mg BID for 7-14 days.

## **Popular Combinations**

This specific triple therapy is itself a popular combination.  Metronidazole may be substituted for clarithromycin in cases of clarithromycin resistance or allergy.


## **Precautions**

Assess for allergies to penicillin, macrolides, and PPIs. Evaluate renal and hepatic function. Monitor for drug interactions. Instruct patients to report any signs of allergic reactions or adverse effects. Caution patients about driving or operating machinery if dizziness or drowsiness occurs.
