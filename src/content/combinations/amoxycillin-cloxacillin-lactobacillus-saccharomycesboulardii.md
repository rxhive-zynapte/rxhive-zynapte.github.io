## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the treatment of various bacterial infections, especially those caused by susceptible strains of *Staphylococcus* and *Streptococcus*.  It's commonly used for infections of the respiratory tract (e.g., pneumonia, bronchitis), skin and soft tissues, urinary tract, and ear, nose, and throat. It is not effective against viral infections.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antibiotic (amoxicillin and cloxacillin); Probiotic (Lactobacillus and *Saccharomyces boulardii*)

- **Mechanism of Action:** Amoxicillin and cloxacillin inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial death. Lactobacillus and *Saccharomyces boulardii* help restore the balance of gut flora, potentially disrupted by antibiotic use. *Saccharomyces boulardii* also has some direct anti-infective properties.


## **Alternate Names**

- Amoxicillin + Cloxacillin + Lactobacillus + *Saccharomyces boulardii*
- Moxfit CX (brand name)
- Oxfit CX (brand name)



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Amoxicillin and cloxacillin exert bactericidal effects by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in the bacterial cell wall. This inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis, a crucial component of the bacterial cell wall, resulting in cell lysis and death. Lactobacillus and *Saccharomyces boulardii* help restore and maintain the gut microbial balance. *Saccharomyces boulardii* has anti-inflammatory and antitoxin effects within the gut.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Amoxicillin and cloxacillin are well-absorbed orally. Food may slightly delay but does not significantly reduce absorption. 
    - **Metabolism:** Both antibiotics are minimally metabolized.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion. Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with renal impairment.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Typical dosage: 250mg/250mg (amoxicillin/cloxacillin) every 6 hours.
- Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on the severity of infection and patient response.

#### **Children:**

- Dosage is weight/age-based. Consult a healthcare professional for pediatric dosing recommendations. 
- This medication may not be suitable for children under 12, depending on the formulation.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be needed based on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage reductions are necessary depending on the degree of impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised; dosage adjustments may be needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution. Specific adjustments should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

While generally used for the conditions mentioned in the "Usage" section, specific dosing for clinical situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations isn't standardized and must be determined by the attending physician based on individual patient needs.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications should be based on renal/hepatic function, age, and other patient-specific factors.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Diarrhea
- Abdominal pain/bloating
- Indigestion
- Skin rash or itching

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea (CDAD)
- Allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema)
