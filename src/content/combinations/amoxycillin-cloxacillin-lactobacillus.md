## **Usage**

Amoxycillin + Cloxacillin + Lactobacillus is a combination medication used to treat various bacterial infections. It combines two antibiotics (Amoxycillin and Cloxacillin) with the probiotic *Lactobacillus*.  This combination is effective against infections of the:

* Respiratory tract (e.g., pneumonia, bronchitis, tonsillitis, sinusitis)
* Skin and soft tissues (e.g., cellulitis, boils, abscesses)
* Urinary tract (e.g., cystitis, pyelonephritis)
* Ear, nose, and throat
* Bones and joints
* Blood
* Other infections in various organs.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Amoxycillin and Cloxacillin: Beta-lactam antibiotics (Penicillins)
* Lactobacillus: Probiotic

**Mechanism of Action:**

Amoxycillin and Cloxacillin inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to and inactivating penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).  This weakens the cell wall, leading to bacterial lysis and death. Cloxacillin is penicillinase-resistant, making it effective against bacteria that produce this enzyme, which would otherwise inactivate Amoxycillin. *Lactobacillus* helps restore the balance of gut flora, which can be disrupted by antibiotic use, preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea.


## **Alternate Names**

There are no officially recognized alternate names for this specific combination drug. However, it is marketed under various brand names, which can vary regionally. Some examples include:

* Moxfit CX
* Oxfit CX
* Amoxyclox LB
* Kritmox-CL


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Amoxycillin and Cloxacillin exert bactericidal effects by disrupting bacterial cell wall synthesis. *Lactobacillus* helps maintain and restore the normal gut flora.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Amoxycillin and Cloxacillin are well-absorbed orally.  Food may slightly delay absorption, but overall bioavailability is not significantly affected. *Lactobacillus* colonizes the gut.
* **Metabolism:** Amoxycillin and Cloxacillin undergo minimal metabolism.
* **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion for Amoxycillin and Cloxacillin.


**Mode of Action:** Amoxycillin and Cloxacillin inhibit transpeptidases and other enzymes involved in cell wall synthesis, preventing the cross-linking of peptidoglycans, thus weakening the cell wall.


**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Amoxycillin and Cloxacillin inhibit penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), enzymes essential for bacterial cell wall synthesis.


**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  250mg/250mg (Amoxycillin/Cloxacillin) every 6 hours. Dosages up to 500mg/500mg may be used depending on the severity of the infection.

#### **Children:**  Dosage is based on weight or age. This combination may not be suitable for children under 12, depending on the specific formulation. Pediatric dosages should be determined by a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is necessary depending on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, and dosage adjustments may be required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for conditions such as diabetes, gastrointestinal disease, and immunosuppression.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for these settings are similar to standard dosage, potentially adjusted based on infection severity and patient response. Consult local guidelines for specific scenarios.

* **Intubation**
* **Surgical Procedures** (prophylaxis)
* **Mechanical Ventilation** (for associated infections)
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
* **Emergency Situations**


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are based on renal function, hepatic function, patient age, and other relevant factors. Consult clinical guidelines and expert advice for specific recommendations.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Stomach pain/bloating
* Skin rash or itching


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* *Clostridium difficile* infection
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term use can lead to antibiotic resistance and disruption of gut flora.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Any sign of allergy, including rash, itching, or swelling, requires immediate discontinuation and medical assessment.  Severe diarrhea should be evaluated for *C. difficile* infection.


## **Contraindications**

* Known hypersensitivity to penicillins or cephalosporins.
* History of cholestatic jaundice or hepatic dysfunction associated with penicillin use.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Antibiotics:** Tetracyclines, Macrolides, Chloramphenicol
* **Anticoagulants:** Warfarin
* **Anti-gout Medications:** Probenecid, Allopurinol
* **Immunosuppressants:** Methotrexate
* **Oral Contraceptives:** Efficacy may be reduced.
* **Others:** Allopurinol


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but consult a doctor before use.  Amoxicillin is excreted in breast milk in low concentrations.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, restores gut flora.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Penicillin/cephalosporin allergy, prior cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction with penicillins.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Several, including some antibiotics, anticoagulants, and anti-gout medications.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe, but consult a doctor.
* **Dosage:**  See detailed dosage section.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal and hepatic function, signs of allergic reactions, resolution of infection.


## **Popular Combinations**  May be combined with other antibiotics or medications, depending on the specific infection.


## **Precautions**

Assess renal and hepatic function, allergy history, and potential drug interactions. Monitor for adverse reactions. Advise on potential interactions with food (calcium-rich foods, grapefruit).
