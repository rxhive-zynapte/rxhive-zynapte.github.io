## **Usage**

This combination of amoxicillin, cloxacillin, and probenecid is primarily prescribed for the treatment of bacterial infections, particularly those caused by beta-lactamase-producing organisms.  It is especially useful in infections where higher and sustained blood levels of amoxicillin are desired, such as in gonorrhea.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Antibiotic combination with a uricosuric agent.

**Mechanism of Action:** Amoxicillin and cloxacillin are beta-lactam antibiotics that inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).  Cloxacillin is penicillinase-resistant, expanding its spectrum of activity.  Probenecid inhibits renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin, increasing its serum concentration and prolonging its half-life.


## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific three-drug combination.  However, amoxicillin/cloxacillin combinations are sometimes marketed under various brand names.  Probenecid is available generically and under various brand names as well.  Brand names can vary regionally and internationally.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Amoxicillin and cloxacillin disrupt bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death. Probenecid increases serum uric acid excretion by inhibiting its reabsorption in the renal tubules. This action also inhibits the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin, thereby increasing amoxicillin levels in the body.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Amoxicillin and cloxacillin are well-absorbed orally. Probenecid affects the pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin by reducing its renal clearance.  The combination is primarily excreted renally.

**Mode of Action:**  Amoxicillin and cloxacillin bind to PBPs on bacteria, inhibiting transpeptidation and peptidoglycan synthesis, crucial steps in cell wall formation. Cloxacillin is resistant to breakdown by bacterial beta-lactamases.  Probenecid inhibits the organic anion transporters (OATs) in the kidneys, responsible for the secretion of various organic anions, including amoxicillin and uric acid.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for all three drugs.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Amoxicillin/cloxacillin combinations are typically dosed based on the individual components. A common regimen might be 500mg of each, taken three times daily. Probenecid is often given as a single 1g dose initially, followed by 500mg twice daily.  Dosages may vary depending on the specific infection and the patient's condition.  Consult local guidelines and product information for the specific brand used.

#### **Children:** Dosage is weight-based for children and requires careful calculation. Pediatric dosing guidance should be obtained from reputable resources.



#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary based on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Significant dose reductions are needed based on the degree of impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Cloxacillin is primarily metabolized hepatically, so caution is advised. Dosage adjustments may be needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider potential drug interactions and adjust accordingly.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations should be guided by established institutional protocols and tailored to the individual patient's condition and infection.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications based on renal function, hepatic function, and other factors are crucial to optimize efficacy and minimize toxicity.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and hypersensitivity reactions.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), Stevens-Johnson syndrome,  Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, and interstitial nephritis.

### **Long-Term Effects:**  With prolonged use, potential for antibiotic resistance development, and effects on gut microbiota.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
Severe skin reactions, hematological abnormalities, seizures (rare).


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to penicillins, cephalosporins, or probenecid; history of severe penicillin allergy;  uric acid kidney stones (probenecid); active gout attacks (probenecid);  blood dyscrasias (probenecid).


## **Drug Interactions**

Probenecid interacts with many drugs by inhibiting their renal tubular secretion.  Clinically significant interactions can occur with allopurinol, methotrexate, oral anticoagulants, and other antibiotics.  Amoxicillin may reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives.  Refer to comprehensive drug interaction resources before prescribing.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Amoxicillin is generally considered safe during pregnancy.  Cloxacillin and probenecid data are limited; use with caution only if clearly needed. Consult specialized resources.  Amoxicillin is excreted in breast milk; cloxacillin and probenecid excretion is not well-established. Monitor infants for side effects if these medications are used during breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis (amoxicillin/cloxacillin); inhibition of renal tubular secretion of uric acid and amoxicillin (probenecid).
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, hypersensitivity reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Penicillin/cephalosporin allergy, uric acid kidney stones, blood dyscrasias.
- **Drug Interactions:** Numerous, including allopurinol, methotrexate, anticoagulants.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Amoxicillin generally safe in pregnancy; cloxacillin/probenecid data limited.  Excretion in breast milk varies.
- **Dosage:** Highly variable; adjust for age, weight, renal function, and infection severity.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, liver function, signs of hypersensitivity, complete blood count.


## **Popular Combinations**

This combination itself is not a "popular" combination.  Amoxicillin/cloxacillin is used. Probenecid is used with beta-lactam antibiotics other than amoxicillin/cloxacillin for specific indications like gonorrhea.



## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Assess for allergies, renal/hepatic function, and other medical conditions.
- **Pregnant Women:** Use cautiously if clearly needed.
- **Breastfeeding Mothers:**  Monitor infant for potential side effects.
- **Children & Elderly:** Dosage adjustments required.
