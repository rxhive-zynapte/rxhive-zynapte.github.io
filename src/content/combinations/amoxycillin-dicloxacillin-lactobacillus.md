## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for bacterial infections susceptible to amoxicillin and dicloxacillin, particularly skin and soft tissue infections, respiratory tract infections (like tonsillitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia), and urinary tract infections. The addition of *Lactobacillus* aims to prevent or treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Antibiotic, Probiotic (specifically *Lactobacillus*) combination.

**Mechanism of Action:** Amoxicillin and Dicloxacillin are beta-lactam antibiotics that inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), leading to bacterial cell lysis and death. Dicloxacillin is penicillinase-resistant, expanding its activity against penicillinase-producing bacteria. *Lactobacillus*, a probiotic, helps restore the gut flora balance, mitigating the diarrheal side effects often associated with antibiotic use.


## **Alternate Names**

Novaclox-LB, PDLIN-D Plus, MOXSTA-DX-LB, Amyvox DLB, Diamox LB.  International and regional name variations exist. Different formulations with varying strengths and  *Lactobacillus* species/strains (e.g., *L. sporogenes*, *L. acidophilus*) may also be available.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Amoxicillin and Dicloxacillin are bactericidal, disrupting bacterial cell wall integrity. *Lactobacillus* exerts its probiotic effect by competing with pathogenic bacteria for resources and adhesion sites in the gut.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Amoxicillin and Dicloxacillin are well-absorbed orally. Food may slightly affect the absorption of Dicloxacillin, which is preferably taken on an empty stomach. They are metabolized in the liver to a limited extent and primarily excreted renally. *Lactobacillus* acts locally in the gastrointestinal tract, with its survival and colonization varying depending on the strain.


**Mode of Action:**  Inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis (Amoxicillin and Dicloxacillin); Restoration of gut flora (Lactobacillus).

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**  Amoxicillin and Dicloxacillin primarily target PBPs, enzymes crucial for bacterial cell wall synthesis. *Lactobacillus* mechanisms are complex and not fully elucidated, involving competition for nutrients and adhesion sites and modulating the immune system.

**Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion (Amoxicillin and Dicloxacillin); *Lactobacillus* is removed through the gastrointestinal tract.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The typical adult dose is 250-500 mg of Amoxicillin and 250-500mg of Dicloxacillin, every 6 hours. The *Lactobacillus* component might vary (e.g., 2.5 billion spores, 60 million spores). 


#### **Children:**

Dosage in children below 12 years should be determined based on weight and the specific formulation, consulting pediatric guidelines.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment based on renal function may be necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage reduction or extended dosing intervals are usually required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, though significant dose adjustment may not always be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized assessment is essential, especially with conditions like asthma, allergies, or gastrointestinal disorders.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is generally not specifically indicated for the listed clinical scenarios (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations), but rather based on the infection being targeted.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**
Dose adjustments are often based on renal function, age, and the severity of infection.


## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, heartburn, bloating, gas, mouth ulcers, changes in taste, and allergic reactions (rash, itching).


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema), *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea, blood dyscrasias (rare), hepatitis (rare).



### **Long-Term Effects:**

With prolonged use, potential for antibiotic resistance, vitamin K deficiency (rare), and superinfections (e.g., fungal infections).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Anaphylaxis, angioedema, severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome - rare), drug-induced liver injury (rare).




## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to penicillins or cephalosporins, history of cholestatic jaundice or hepatic dysfunction associated with penicillin use.



## **Drug Interactions**

Probenecid, allopurinol, anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), methotrexate, oral contraceptives, other antibiotics (e.g., tetracyclines). Food rich in calcium or grapefruit may decrease absorption of Dicloxacillin.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Amoxicillin and Dicloxacillin are generally considered safe during pregnancy (Pregnancy Category B) but should be used only if clearly needed. They are excreted in breast milk. Consult specialist guidelines regarding use during breastfeeding. *Lactobacillus* safety profile during pregnancy and lactation is less well-established.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Amoxicillin and Dicloxacillin: Inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. *Lactobacillus*: Modulation of gut flora.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, allergic reactions, abdominal discomfort.
- **Contraindications:** Penicillin or cephalosporin allergy.
- **Drug Interactions:** Probenecid, anticoagulants, methotrexate, oral contraceptives.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally considered safe but use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
- **Dosage:** Varies depending on the infection and patient factors; generally 250-500mg of each antibiotic every 6 hours for adults.

## **Popular Combinations**

This three-drug combination itself is commonly used. However, the formulation might contain different *Lactobacillus* species or strains.


## **Precautions**

Assess for penicillin allergy before administration. Monitor renal and hepatic function, particularly with prolonged use. Be vigilant for signs of superinfections (e.g., candidiasis, *C. difficile* infection). Patients with asthma or allergies should be monitored closely. Advise patients to complete the entire course of therapy.
