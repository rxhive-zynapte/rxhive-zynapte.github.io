## **Usage**

Amoxycillin + Lactobacillus acidophilus + Potassium clavulanate is prescribed for a variety of bacterial infections, including those of the ears, nose, throat, lungs (including pneumonia and bronchitis), sinuses, skin, urinary tract, bones, joints, and soft tissues. It may also be used to treat infectious diarrhea and, in combination with other medications, for *H. pylori* infections in the stomach. It is ineffective against viral infections like the common cold and flu.  Its pharmacological classifications are antibiotic and probiotic.

Amoxycillin interferes with bacterial cell wall synthesis, ultimately leading to bacterial death. Potassium clavulanate is a beta-lactamase inhibitor. It enhances amoxycillin's effectiveness by inhibiting beta-lactamase, an enzyme produced by some bacteria that can make them resistant to antibiotics. Lactobacillus acidophilus is a probiotic that helps restore the gut's healthy bacteria, potentially minimizing antibiotic-associated diarrhea caused by disruption of the gut flora.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination does not have an official international nonproprietary name (INN). Some regional or descriptive names may include "Amoxicillin-clavulanate-probiotic" or "Amoxicillin-clavulanate with Lactobacillus."  Brand names include Pinoclav-CL LB, App-MOXCV 625 lb, Gymox CV, and Acv-LB.  Many others exist.  Please note this is not an exhaustive list.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Amoxycillin exerts a bactericidal effect by inhibiting the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, leading to cell lysis and death. Potassium clavulanate has no significant antibacterial activity on its own but protects amoxycillin by inactivating bacterial beta-lactamases. Lactobacillus acidophilus exerts its probiotic effects by competing with pathogenic bacteria for resources and adhesion sites in the gut. It also produces lactic acid, which creates an unfavorable environment for some harmful bacteria.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Amoxycillin is well-absorbed orally and is stable in the presence of gastric acid. Taking it at the beginning of a meal may enhance absorption. Absorption of clavulanate is also good after oral administration.
* **Metabolism:** Amoxycillin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. A small fraction is metabolized to inactive penicilloic acid. Clavulanate undergoes extensive metabolism, with only a small amount excreted unchanged in urine.
* **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion for both amoxycillin and clavulanate. Dose adjustments are necessary for patients with renal impairment.

**Mode of Action:**  Amoxycillin inhibits transpeptidases and carboxypeptidases, enzymes crucial for bacterial cell wall synthesis. Clavulanate irreversibly binds to bacterial beta-lactamases, preventing them from degrading amoxycillin.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Dosage depends on the severity and site of the infection.  Common regimens include 250/125 mg (amoxycillin/clavulanate) every 8 hours or 500/125 mg every 12 hours, or 875/125 mg every 12 hours for more severe infections. The amount of Lactobacillus acidophilus varies depending on the specific formulation.


#### **Children:** Pediatric dosing is typically weight-based, ranging from 20 to 45 mg/kg/day of the amoxycillin component, divided into doses given every 8 or 12 hours, depending on the infection's severity. Specific pediatric formulations are available. Dosing should be determined by a physician.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be needed based on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose reduction and/or increased dosing intervals are required.  Avoid the 875/125 mg tablet formulation in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution and monitor liver function.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider potential drug interactions with other medications the patient may be taking.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Specific dosages for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations should be determined on a case-by-case basis by the treating physician, considering the patient's condition, the infection's severity, and potential drug interactions.  General guidelines provided in the Standard Dosage section apply, with adjustments as needed.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are essential for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  Consult specific guidelines and consider factors like creatinine clearance and liver function tests.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, skin rash, itching, bloating, gas, flatulence.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
* *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea (CDAD).
* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema, serum sickness-like reaction).
*  Hepatotoxicity (cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis).
*  Blood dyscrasias (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis).


### **Long-Term Effects:**  With prolonged use, potential risks include the development of antibiotic resistance, *C. difficile* infection, and vitamin K deficiency.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Severe allergic reactions require immediate medical attention. Any signs of hepatotoxicity or blood dyscrasias should be investigated promptly.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to amoxycillin, clavulanate, other penicillins, or any component of the formulation.
* History of cholestatic jaundice or hepatic dysfunction associated with amoxycillin-clavulanate use.


## **Drug Interactions**

* Allopurinol: Increased risk of skin rash.
* Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin):  May potentiate anticoagulant effects.
* Oral contraceptives: May reduce efficacy.
* Methotrexate: Increased methotrexate toxicity.
* Probenecid: Increases amoxycillin levels.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Amoxycillin-clavulanate is generally considered safe to use during pregnancy if medically necessary.  It is excreted in breast milk, and while generally considered compatible with breastfeeding, infants should be monitored for diarrhea, rash, and irritability. Discuss with the patient to weigh the benefits of breastfeeding against potential risks to the infant.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Amoxycillin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis; clavulanate inhibits beta-lactamase; Lactobacillus acidophilus promotes a healthy gut flora.
* **Side Effects:** Common: diarrhea, nausea, rash. Serious: allergic reactions, hepatotoxicity, CDAD.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to penicillins, history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction with amoxycillin-clavulanate.
* **Drug Interactions:** Allopurinol, anticoagulants, oral contraceptives, methotrexate, probenecid.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally considered safe if medically indicated; monitor infant if breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** Varies depending on infection; see detailed section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal and liver function, signs of allergic reactions, signs and symptoms of infection.


## **Popular Combinations**

This combination itself is sometimes considered a popular combination. However, combining amoxicillin-clavulanate with other antibiotics is not routinely recommended due to the risk of adverse effects and the development of antibiotic resistance.  The probiotic component is intended to mitigate gastrointestinal side effects associated with antibiotics.



## **Precautions**
* Assess for penicillin allergy before administration.
* Monitor renal and hepatic function, especially with pre-existing conditions.
* Caution in patients with mononucleosis due to increased risk of rash.
* Avoid alcohol during treatment.
