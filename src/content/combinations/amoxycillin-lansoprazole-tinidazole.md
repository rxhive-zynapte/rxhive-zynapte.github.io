## **Usage**

This triple therapy combines an antibiotic (Amoxycillin), a proton pump inhibitor (Lansoprazole), and an antiprotozoal/antibacterial agent (Tinidazole). It is primarily prescribed for *Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)* eradication in patients with peptic ulcers (duodenal and gastric ulcers) and other gastrointestinal infections associated with *H. pylori*. It is also used for the treatment of other bacterial infections of the stomach and digestive system.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Amoxycillin: Antibiotic (Aminopenicillin, Beta-lactam)
* Lansoprazole: Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI)
* Tinidazole: Antiprotozoal, Antibacterial (Nitroimidazole)


**Mechanism of Action:**

Amoxycillin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial death.  Lansoprazole reduces gastric acid production by inhibiting the proton pump (H+/K+ ATPase) in the parietal cells of the stomach lining. Tinidazole disrupts DNA synthesis and other cellular processes in susceptible microorganisms, leading to their death. The combined effect of the medications works synergistically to eradicate the infection.


## **Alternate Names**

There is no single international nonproprietary name (INN) for this specific combination. However, the individual components have several alternate names:

* Amoxycillin: Amoxicillin, Amox, α-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin, p-Hydroxyampicillin
* Lansoprazole: Prevacid, Takecab, Zoton
* Tinidazole: Fasigyn, Simplotan, Tindamax

**Brand Names:** Several brand names are available depending on the manufacturer and region, including LANZOL KT, HELIKIT-LT, LANSIKIT, PYLOMOX and STANCARE.



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Amoxycillin:** Bactericidal action against susceptible bacteria by inhibiting cell wall synthesis.
* **Lansoprazole:** Suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the proton pump, providing relief from symptoms and promoting ulcer healing.
* **Tinidazole:** Disrupts DNA and other cellular processes in bacteria and protozoa, causing cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Amoxycillin:** Well-absorbed orally, widely distributed in tissues and fluids, primarily excreted renally.
* **Lansoprazole:** Activated in the acidic environment of parietal cells, metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, excreted hepatically and renally.
* **Tinidazole:** Well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, excreted in urine and feces.

**Mode of Action (Cellular/Molecular):**

* **Amoxycillin:** Binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in bacterial cell walls, inhibiting transpeptidation and peptidoglycan synthesis, leading to cell lysis.
* **Lansoprazole:** Irreversibly binds to the H+/K+ ATPase in parietal cells, blocking the final step of gastric acid secretion.
* **Tinidazole:** Forms cytotoxic metabolites that interact with microbial DNA, causing strand breakage and impairing cellular function.

**Elimination Pathways:**

* **Amoxycillin:** Primarily renal excretion.
* **Lansoprazole:** Hepatic metabolism (CYP2C19, CYP3A4) and renal excretion.
* **Tinidazole:** Hepatic metabolism and excretion in urine and feces.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

This medication is commonly prescribed for adults and not usually for children younger than 12 years. The optimal dose may vary depending on the particular infection and its severity. It's vital to follow the doctor's prescription and complete the full course of treatment, even if symptoms improve before the medication is finished.

#### **Adults:**

A standard regimen for *H. pylori* eradication includes:

* Lansoprazole: 30 mg
* Amoxycillin: 1000 mg 
* Tinidazole: 500 mg

This combination is usually administered twice daily (every 12 hours) for 7-14 days.


#### **Children:**

The combination is generally not recommended for children younger than 12 years. For older children, dosage must be determined by a doctor and based on the child's weight and the specific infection being treated.



#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary in cases of severe hepatic impairment or other significant comorbidities.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Amoxycillin dosage adjustment is needed for severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min).
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Lansoprazole dosage adjustment is necessary for severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider potential drug interactions and adjust dosages accordingly.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is not specifically indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary use is for *H. pylori* eradication and certain bacterial infections in the stomach and digestive system.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments should be individualized based on patient factors such as renal function, hepatic function, age, and other medical conditions.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, metallic taste, dark urine, fatigue.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema), liver dysfunction (jaundice, hepatitis), blood disorders (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), neurological effects (peripheral neuropathy, seizures).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term use of PPIs may be associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis-related fractures, vitamin B12 deficiency, and *Clostridium difficile* infection.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any signs of hypersensitivity (rash, itching, swelling), severe gastrointestinal issues, neurological symptoms, or blood disorders should prompt immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication, porphyria, history of drug-induced liver injury with a PPI, concomitant use of cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, or terfenadine.


## **Drug Interactions**

Amoxicillin may interact with oral contraceptives, warfarin, methotrexate, probenecid. Lansoprazole interacts with drugs metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Tinidazole can cause a disulfiram-like reaction with alcohol.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Amoxycillin is generally considered safe during pregnancy. The safety of lansoprazole and tinidazole during pregnancy has not been fully established. All components are excreted in breast milk and may cause adverse effects in nursing infants.  The use of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be discussed with a physician to assess the benefit versus risk.
