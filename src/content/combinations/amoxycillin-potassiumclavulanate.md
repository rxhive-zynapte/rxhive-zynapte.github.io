## **Usage**

Amoxycillin + Potassium Clavulanate is prescribed for a variety of bacterial infections, including:

* **Upper Respiratory Tract Infections:**  Sinusitis, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, otitis media.
* **Lower Respiratory Tract Infections:** Pneumonia, bronchitis, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
* **Genitourinary Tract Infections:** Cystitis, pyelonephritis, gonorrhea.
* **Skin and Soft Tissue Infections:** Cellulitis, impetigo, abscesses, animal bites.
* **Bone and Joint Infections:** Osteomyelitis, septic arthritis.
* **Other Infections:** Dental infections, intra-abdominal infections, sepsis.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Antibiotic (beta-lactam, penicillin combination).

**Mechanism of Action:** Amoxycillin is a bactericidal antibiotic that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis.  Potassium clavulanate is a beta-lactamase inhibitor that protects amoxycillin from degradation by bacterial enzymes, extending its spectrum of activity against bacteria that produce beta-lactamases.


## **Alternate Names**

* **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (or amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium)
* **Brand Names:** Augmentin, Co-amoxiclav, Clavace


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Amoxycillin + Potassium Clavulanate exerts a synergistic bactericidal effect by disrupting bacterial cell wall synthesis.  Amoxycillin binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in the bacterial cell wall, inhibiting peptidoglycan cross-linking and leading to cell lysis.  Potassium clavulanate inhibits beta-lactamase enzymes produced by certain bacteria, preventing amoxycillin degradation and extending its effectiveness.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  
* **Absorption:** Both components are well-absorbed orally. Food may slightly delay absorption, but overall bioavailability remains good.
* **Distribution:** Widely distributed throughout the body, including tissues and fluids.
* **Metabolism:** Amoxycillin undergoes minimal metabolism.  Clavulanate is extensively metabolized in the liver.
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted renally, with a small amount eliminated in the bile.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Mild to Moderate Infections:** 250 mg/125 mg every 8 hours or 500 mg/125 mg every 12 hours.
* **Severe Infections:** 500 mg/125 mg every 8 hours or 875 mg/125 mg every 12 hours. Extended release tablets 1000 mg/62.5 mg every 12 hours.

#### **Children:**

* **Children <40 kg, >3 months**: Dosing is weight-based and should be determined by a physician, usually 20-60 mg/5-15 mg/kg/day divided every 8 or 12 hours.
* **Neonates and Infants (<3 months):** 30 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours (based on the amoxycillin component).  Use of the 125 mg/31.25 mg per 5 mL oral suspension is recommended in this age group.
* **Children â‰¥ 40kg:** Adult dosage.
* **Specific scenarios:** Always follow the appropriate guidelines based on the specific condition.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment may be necessary in patients with renal impairment.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction and/or increased dosing interval may be necessary based on creatinine clearance. Consult specific guidelines for precise adjustments based on GFR levels.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised. Dosage adjustment may be required in severe cases.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific dosage adjustments provided based on diabetes or cardiovascular conditions, however, consult individual conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**
Dosages in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are determined on a case-by-case basis by the treating physician, factoring in the type and severity of infection, patient-specific factors, and local guidelines.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Rash
* Vaginal Itching or Discharge
* Diaper Rash (in Infants)


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
* *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea
* Hepatotoxicity (jaundice, liver dysfunction)
* Stevens-Johnson Syndrome
* Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis
* Anaphylaxis
* Angioedema


### **Long-Term Effects:**
Antibiotic-associated colitis can develop after prolonged use.



## **Contraindications**

* History of severe hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) to amoxycillin, clavulanate, or other beta-lactam antibiotics.
* Previous history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction associated with amoxycillin/clavulanate.
* Severe Renal Dysfunction.



## **Drug Interactions**

* **Probenecid:** Increases amoxycillin levels.
* **Allopurinol:** May increase risk of skin rash.
* **Oral Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin):** May enhance anticoagulant effect.
* **Methotrexate:** Increases methotrexate levels and risk of toxicity.
* **Oral Contraceptives:**  Efficacy of oral contraceptives may be reduced.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Pregnancy Category B. Amoxycillin/clavulanate crosses the placenta.  Use only if clearly needed and after careful risk-benefit assessment.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Amoxycillin and clavulanate are excreted in breast milk in small amounts.  Generally considered safe for breastfeeding, but monitor infant for diarrhea, rash, or candidiasis.
