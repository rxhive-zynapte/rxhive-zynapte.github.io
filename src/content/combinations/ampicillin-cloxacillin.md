## **Usage**

Ampicillin + Cloxacillin is a combination antibiotic medication primarily prescribed for bacterial infections caused by susceptible gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria. It falls under the pharmacological classification of beta-lactam antibiotics, specifically penicillins.  This combination is effective against bacteria that produce penicillinase, an enzyme that can break down penicillin, making it ineffective. The mechanism of action involves inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This disrupts cell wall construction, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

Ampicillin + Cloxacillin is also known as Ampiclox or Axylin, along with various other brand names depending on the manufacturer and region.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Ampicillin + Cloxacillin exerts a bactericidal effect. It inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to and inactivating penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall. This action prevents the formation of cross-links in the peptidoglycan layer, a crucial component for cell wall stability. Consequently, the bacterial cell wall weakens, leading to cell lysis and death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Ampicillin is well-absorbed orally, but food can interfere with its absorption. Cloxacillin is also absorbed orally, but to a lesser extent than ampicillin.
* **Distribution:** Both drugs are widely distributed throughout the body, reaching therapeutic concentrations in various tissues and fluids, including pleural, pericardial, synovial, and ascitic fluids.
* **Metabolism:** Both drugs undergo some metabolism in the liver.
* **Elimination:**  Ampicillin and Cloxacillin are primarily eliminated by the kidneys through renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Oral: 250-500 mg every 6 hours.
IV/IM: 500mg to 1g every 4-6 hours.
The dose may be increased up to 2g every 6 hours orally for severe infections. The IV/IM maximum daily dose is 12g.


#### **Children:**

Oral:  Ampicillin/Cloxacillin 125mg every 6 hours.
Neonates: 90mg (60mg ampicillin/30mg cloxacillin) every 4 hours.
Pediatric dosage is often calculated based on weight (25-50mg/kg/day), divided into 4 doses, with a maximum dose of 2g/day.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be needed based on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage should be reduced based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments may be needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised in patients with allergies to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other beta-lactam antibiotics.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage for specific medical settings often follows standard adult or pediatric guidelines adjusted according to the severity of the infection.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are crucial in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Consult specific guidelines for appropriate adjustments based on creatinine clearance or liver function tests.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Rash

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Cholestatic jaundice
* Hepatitis
* Neutropenia
* Agranulocytosis
* *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Prolonged use can lead to antibiotic resistance and superinfections (fungal or bacterial).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis, require immediate medical intervention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to penicillins, cephalosporins, or other beta-lactam antibiotics.
* Infectious mononucleosis.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Antibiotics:** Bacteriostatic antibiotics (e.g., tetracyclines, chloramphenicol) may antagonize the bactericidal action of Ampicillin + Cloxacillin.
* **Anticoagulants:** May enhance the effect of warfarin.
* **Methotrexate:** Ampicillin may decrease the excretion of methotrexate, potentially increasing its toxicity.
* **Allopurinol:** Concurrent use can increase the risk of skin rash.
* **Probenecid:** May increase and prolong blood levels of Ampicillin + Cloxacillin.
* **Oral contraceptives:** May reduce the efficacy of combined oral contraceptives.
* **Quinoline antimalarials:** May reduce the bioavailability of Ampicillin+Cloxacillin.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Caution is advised during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus or infant. Trace amounts of penicillins can be detected in breast milk. Monitor infants for potential side effects.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis.
* **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, rash, allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to penicillins, cephalosporins, infectious mononucleosis.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Various drug interactions exist, especially with other antibiotics, anticoagulants, methotrexate, and allopurinol.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; monitor infants.
* **Dosage:** Varies depending on age, condition, and route of administration.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, liver function, complete blood count (CBC), and observation for signs of allergic reaction.

## **Popular Combinations**

Combined use with aminoglycosides may broaden the spectrum of antimicrobial activity in certain cases.

## **Precautions**

* Assess for allergies to penicillins and cephalosporins before administration.
* Monitor renal and hepatic function, especially with prolonged use.
* Observe for signs of superinfection.
* Advise patients about potential side effects and drug interactions.
