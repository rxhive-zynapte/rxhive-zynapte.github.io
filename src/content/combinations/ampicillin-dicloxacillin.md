## **Usage**

Ampicillin + Dicloxacillin is a combination antibiotic medication primarily prescribed for bacterial infections. It falls under the pharmacological classification of beta-lactam antibiotics, specifically penicillins. This combination is effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria.  It works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.  It is particularly useful against penicillinase-producing staphylococci, thanks to the inclusion of dicloxacillin.

## **Alternate Names**

While there isn't a widely recognized international non-proprietary name (INN) for this specific combination, it is sometimes referred to simply as "Ampicillin/Dicloxacillin."  Brand names vary depending on the region and manufacturer. Some examples include Ampiclox, StayHappi Ampicillin + Dicloxacillin, amongst others.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ampicillin + Dicloxacillin exerts its bactericidal effect by disrupting the synthesis of peptidoglycans, essential components of bacterial cell walls. Both components bind to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) within the bacterial cell wall, inhibiting the transpeptidation and cross-linking reactions necessary for cell wall stability. This weakens the cell wall, causing bacterial lysis and death. Dicloxacillin's presence extends the effectiveness to penicillinase-producing bacteria, which would otherwise inactivate ampicillin.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Ampicillin is well-absorbed orally, while dicloxacillin's oral absorption is somewhat less reliable but improved when taken on an empty stomach. Both drugs are distributed widely throughout the body, achieving therapeutic concentrations in various tissues and fluids. Metabolism is minimal for both drugs. Elimination primarily occurs via renal excretion, requiring dose adjustments in patients with renal impairment.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The typical adult dose is 250 mg to 500 mg every six hours, administered orally.  The dose and duration of therapy depend on the infection's severity and the patient's response.

#### **Children:**

Pediatric dosing is weight-based, typically ranging from 12.5 mg/kg to 25 mg/kg every six hours, administered orally. For children weighing 40 kg or more, the adult dose may be appropriate. Safety and efficacy in infants younger than one month have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction and/or increased dosing intervals are required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, and dose adjustment may be needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider comorbid conditions like diabetes (may cause false-positive urine glucose tests) and gastrointestinal disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific clinical settings should be guided by culture and susceptibility testing, clinical response, and local guidelines.  The standard dosage recommendations mentioned above usually suffice. Adjustments may be necessary in severe infections.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

* **Renal Impairment:**  Refer to specific renal dosing guidelines based on creatinine clearance.
* **Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments are universally established, but caution is advised.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Rash
* Urticaria
* Abdominal pain or discomfort
* Headache


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
*  Pseudomembranous colitis
* *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea
*  Neutropenia
*  Hepatic dysfunction
*  Interstitial nephritis
* Seizures


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Prolonged use can increase the risk of antibiotic resistance and secondary infections like *C. difficile* infection.



## **Contraindications**

* Known hypersensitivity to penicillins or cephalosporins
* History of severe penicillin-induced reactions (anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome)


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Antibiotics:** Tetracyclines may antagonize bactericidal effects. Aminoglycosides may have interactions
* **Anticoagulants:** May enhance the effect of warfarin.
* **Uricosuric Agents:** Probenecid may increase and prolong serum levels.
* **Methotrexate:** Ampicillin may increase methotrexate toxicity.
* **Allopurinol:** Concurrent use may increase the risk of skin rash.
* **Food:** Dicloxacillin absorption is reduced with food.
* **Alcohol:** While not strictly contraindicated, caution is advised.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Ampicillin is classified as Pregnancy Category B by the FDA (animal studies have not shown fetal harm, but controlled human studies are lacking). Dicloxacillin's safety during pregnancy hasn't been definitively established.  While both drugs are excreted in breast milk, they are generally considered compatible with breastfeeding in low doses. It's crucial to weigh the potential benefits against the risks and discuss with the patient.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis.
* **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, nausea, rash, allergic reactions (rarely severe).
* **Contraindications:** Penicillin/cephalosporin hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:** Tetracyclines, warfarin, probenecid.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally considered safe but caution advised. Discuss with the patient.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 250-500 mg q6h orally. Pediatrics: Weight-based dosing.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal and liver function, signs of superinfection (especially with prolonged use), complete blood count with differential.

## **Popular Combinations**

There are no formally established "popular combinations" where other drugs are intentionally added to Ampicillin + Dicloxacillin.  However, probiotics might be considered to mitigate antibiotic-associated diarrhea.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess for penicillin allergy, renal/hepatic function.
* **Specific Populations:**  Refer to the sections on dosage adjustments and pregnancy/breastfeeding.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Moderate alcohol consumption is generally permissible; however, it is always best to check for patient specific advice. Driving restrictions are not typically necessary unless the patient experiences dizziness.
