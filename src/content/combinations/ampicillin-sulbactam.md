## **Usage**

Ampicillin + Sulbactam is prescribed for a variety of bacterial infections. It's effective against skin and skin structure infections, intra-abdominal infections, gynecological infections, and respiratory tract infections. This combination is particularly useful against bacteria producing beta-lactamase, an enzyme that can break down certain antibiotics like ampicillin.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Beta-lactam antibiotic (Penicillin class combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor).

**Mechanism of Action:** Ampicillin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death. Sulbactam, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, protects ampicillin from being deactivated by beta-lactamase enzymes produced by some bacteria, thus broadening its spectrum of activity.

## **Alternate Names**

Sultamicillin (prodrug combination).

**Brand Names:** Unasyn.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ampicillin + Sulbactam exerts bactericidal activity by disrupting bacterial cell wall synthesis during active replication. Sulbactam, while having minimal intrinsic antibacterial activity, irreversibly binds to beta-lactamases, preventing them from inactivating ampicillin.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** After intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) administration, ampicillin and sulbactam are rapidly absorbed and distributed widely in the body, reaching therapeutic levels in various tissues and fluids.  Oral administration of sultamicillin, a prodrug of ampicillin/sulbactam, results in absorption and subsequent hydrolysis to release the active components.
* **Metabolism:** Minimal metabolism occurs for both drugs.
* **Elimination:**  Primarily renal excretion. Ampicillin and sulbactam have similar elimination half-lives, which increase in patients with renal impairment.

**Mode of Action:** Ampicillin binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), enzymes crucial for the final cross-linking step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell walls. This binding disrupts the cell wall integrity, leading to bacterial lysis and death. Sulbactam, by inhibiting beta-lactamases, protects ampicillin from degradation.

**Elimination Pathways:** Renal excretion is the primary elimination pathway.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

1.5 g to 3 g (ampicillin + sulbactam) IV or IM every 6 hours.  The maximum daily dose of sulbactam should not exceed 4 grams. Less severe infections may be treated with 1.5-3g every 12 hours.  For oral administration (sultamicillin), 375-750 mg twice daily.

#### **Children:**

* **Neonates (first week of life, especially preterm):** 75 mg/kg/day (ampicillin + sulbactam) IV or IM divided every 12 hours.
* **Infants and Children:** 150 mg/kg/day (ampicillin + sulbactam) IV or IM divided every 6 or 8 hours.
* **Children >1 year (skin infections):** 300 mg/kg/day IV infused over 6 hours, divided every 6 hours for up to 14 days.
* **Children ≥40 kg:** Adult dose.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage based on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Adjust dose and frequency based on creatinine clearance (CrCl). For CrCl 15–29 mL/min, administer every 12 hours. For CrCl <15 mL/min, administer every 24 hours.  Hemodialysis patients: administer 1.5 g - 3 g after dialysis.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment usually needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient factors and adjust accordingly.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Intubation, Surgical Procedures (Abdominal or Pelvic), Cesarean Section:** 1.5 g to 3 g IV or IM at induction of anesthesia, then every 6-8 hours as needed. Discontinue 24 hours post-op unless therapeutically indicated.
* **Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use:**  Dose according to the infection being treated and renal function.
* **Emergency Situations:** Dose according to the infection being treated and renal function.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Diarrhea, rash, pain at the injection site, nausea, vomiting.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome), seizures (with rapid IV infusion), *Clostridium difficile* associated diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, liver dysfunction (cholestatic jaundice).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

*C. difficile* associated diarrhea can occur up to 2 months or more after treatment.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to penicillins, cephalosporins or sulbactam, history of cholestatic jaundice or hepatic dysfunction associated with ampicillin/sulbactam.

## **Drug Interactions**

Allopurinol (increased risk of rash), probenecid (increased ampicillin/sulbactam levels), anticoagulants (altered coagulation tests), bacteriostatic antibiotics (decreased bactericidal effect), oral contraceptives (reduced effectiveness), methotrexate (decreased clearance, increased toxicity).

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy:**  Pregnancy category B. Use only if potential benefit outweighs risk.

**Breastfeeding:** Ampicillin and sulbactam are excreted in breast milk. Monitor the infant for diarrhea.
