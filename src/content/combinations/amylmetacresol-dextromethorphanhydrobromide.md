      Can I consume alcohol while using this medication?**


      **A:** Alcohol can exacerbate the sedative effects of dextromethorphan,
      leading to increased drowsiness and impaired cognitive function. It's best
      to avoid or limit alcohol consumption during treatment.

## **Usage**

- This combination medication is prescribed for the relief of dry cough associated with a sore throat (pharyngitis).  It works locally to soothe and lubricate the irritated area in the mouth and throat.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antitussive (Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide), Antiseptic (Amylmetacresol).  
- **Mechanism of Action:** Amylmetacresol acts as a local antiseptic and mild anesthetic, while Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide suppresses the cough reflex by acting on the cough center in the brain.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination.  Regional variations in nomenclature may occur.
- **Brand Names:**  Tusq-D is a frequently encountered brand name. Other brand names may exist depending on the region and manufacturer.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Amylmetacresol provides local antiseptic action and mild local anesthetic effects. Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide suppresses the cough reflex centrally, similar to codeine, but without analgesic or addictive properties at typical doses. It does not inhibit ciliary activity.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Dextromethorphan:** Absorbed rapidly from the GI tract, reaching peak plasma concentrations in about 2-2.5 hours. Extensive first-pass metabolism reduces bioavailability. Maximum clinical effects manifest 5-6 hours post-ingestion. Distributed widely in the body, metabolized by the liver (CYP2D6 enzyme), and excreted primarily in the urine. Genetic variations in CYP2D6 activity can influence drug levels and individual responses.
    - **Amylmetacresol:** Acts locally, minimal systemic absorption. Information on its metabolism and elimination pathways is limited.
- **Mode of Action:** Amylmetacresol is believed to work by altering bacterial protein structure. Its anesthetic effect likely involves modulation of sodium channels. Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide acts on sigma opioid receptors in the central nervous system, raising the threshold for coughing.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Dextromethorphan is mainly excreted renally. Limited data exists on Amylmetacresol excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  One lozenge every 4 hours as needed, not to exceed 12 lozenges in 24 hours.

#### **Children:**
- 6 to 12 years: One lozenge every 4 hours, not exceeding 6 lozenges per 24 hours.
- Under 6 years: Not recommended due to choking risk.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to potential age-related changes in drug metabolism and clearance.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary. Consult specialist guidance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution.  Dosage adjustment may be warranted.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Assess individual circumstances, particularly asthma, COPD, and concurrent use of CNS depressants or medications metabolized by CYP2D6.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is specifically indicated for cough relief associated with a sore throat and is not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are made based on individual patient factors such as renal or hepatic impairment, age, and concomitant medications, particularly CYP2D6 inhibitors.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Dizziness
- Drowsiness
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Confusion
- Agitation
- Sore tongue
- Stomach upset

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions (rash, difficulty breathing, facial swelling)
- Serotonin syndrome (with MAOIs or other serotonergic drugs)
- Respiratory depression (in high doses or with other CNS depressants)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Data on chronic effects is limited. Prolonged use is generally not recommended.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Serotonin Syndrome
- Respiratory depression
- Allergic reactions


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to either Amylmetacresol or Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide.
- Concurrent use of MAO inhibitors (or within 14 days of discontinuation).
- Patients with productive cough, respiratory failure, or risk thereof.
- Cough associated with asthma, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis.
- Children under 6 years old.
- Fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption, or sucrose-isomaltose insufficiency.

## **Drug Interactions**

- MAO Inhibitors:  Risk of serotonin syndrome (hyperpyrexia, hypotension, myoclonic jerks, coma).
- CYP2D6 Inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine): Elevated dextromethorphan levels, increased toxicity risk.
- CNS Depressants (e.g., alcohol, antihistamines, psychotropics):  Additive CNS depressive effects.
- Serotonergic Drugs: Risk of serotonin syndrome.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  C (consult sources for latest FDA classification). Potential adverse fetal effects.  Use cautiously if benefits outweigh risks.
- **Breastfeeding:** Potential excretion in breast milk. Exercise caution. Discuss safer alternatives with a physician.
