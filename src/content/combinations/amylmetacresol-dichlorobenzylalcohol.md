## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Amylmetacresol combined with Dichlorobenzyl alcohol is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of mouth and throat infections, including sore throat (pharyngitis), and minor mouth infections.  It is often used for the relief of discomfort associated with these conditions.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Oral antiseptic, local anesthetic (when combined with Lidocaine).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Both Amylmetacresol and Dichlorobenzyl alcohol are mild antiseptics with antibacterial, antifungal, and limited antiviral properties. They work by killing bacteria, fungi, and some viruses associated with mouth and throat infections. The combination often exhibits synergistic antibacterial action. The lozenge format promotes localized action in the oropharynx and increases saliva production, which lubricates and soothes the throat.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate generic names.
- **Brand Names:** Strepsils (various formulations), Cepacol (some formulations), Difflam (some formulations), Trosoothe Plus (with Lidocaine), Neo-angin, Coldangin, Vocasept.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Amylmetacresol and Dichlorobenzyl alcohol exert a local antiseptic effect in the oropharynx.  The combined action reduces throat soreness, provides pain relief, and eases swallowing difficulties within minutes of administration, with effects lasting up to two hours. This relief may be attributed to antiseptic activity and a potential interaction with sodium channels involved in pain signaling.  When combined with lidocaine, the anesthetic effect is enhanced.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Limited information is available on the pharmacokinetics of this combination.  Administered as a lozenge, the drugs primarily exert their effects locally in the oral cavity and throat. Absorption into the systemic circulation is expected to be minimal. Metabolism and elimination pathways for Amylmetacresol are not well-characterized. Dichlorobenzyl alcohol is metabolized in the liver to hippuric acid and excreted in urine. Lidocaine, when present, is absorbed through mucous membranes, metabolized in the liver, and excreted in urine.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- One lozenge dissolved slowly in the mouth every 2-3 hours as needed.
- Maximum of 8-12 lozenges in 24 hours (depending on specific product formulation and local guidelines).

#### **Children:**
- Generally not recommended for children under 6 years old due to choking hazard.
- Children over 6:  Follow adult dosage guidelines, but some formulations recommend a lower maximum daily dose (e.g., 4 lozenges in 24 hours). Always refer to product-specific information.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required, but caution is advised in severe impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required, but caution is advised in severe impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with asthma, bronchospasm, or methemoglobinemia (especially when combined with lidocaine).  For diabetic patients, consider sugar content of lozenges.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources do not mention dosage recommendations for these clinical settings. The primary use is for symptomatic relief of throat discomfort.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are not generally required based on renal or hepatic function but should be considered in cases of severe impairment.
