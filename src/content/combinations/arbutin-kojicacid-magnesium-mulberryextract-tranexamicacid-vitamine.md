## **Usage**

This combination of ingredients is primarily used topically for the treatment of **melasma and hyperpigmentation**.  It aims to lighten darkened skin patches and achieve a more even skin tone.  It is considered a **skin-lightening agent**.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination does not have a single, universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN). It is often referred to by the names of its constituent ingredients. Several brand names exist, including **Tyrodin, Kromaglo, Melano-TX,  Melanorm TX,** and **Spekzo TX**.

## **How It Works**

This topical formulation exerts its effects through multiple mechanisms involving its various components:

* **Tranexamic acid:** Inhibits plasmin, a protein involved in inflammation, which can contribute to melanocyte activation and melanin production. It also offers some UV protection.

* **Kojic acid:**  A tyrosinase inhibitor derived from fungi. Tyrosinase is a key enzyme in melanin biosynthesis. By inhibiting tyrosinase, kojic acid reduces melanin production.

* **Arbutin:** Another tyrosinase inhibitor, derived from the bearberry plant. It further contributes to reducing melanin synthesis.

* **Magnesium ascorbyl phosphate (MAP):** A stable form of vitamin C, acting as an antioxidant that protects against UV damage and may also inhibit melanin production.

* **Vitamin E (tocopherol acetate):** An antioxidant that protects against UV-induced damage, which can trigger melanogenesis. It also supports skin barrier function.

* **Mulberry extract:** Possesses antioxidant and tyrosinase-inhibiting properties, contributing to the overall skin-lightening and anti-aging effects.


The **pharmacokinetics** of this topical combination have not been extensively studied.  Absorption through the skin is expected to be limited, but some systemic absorption of certain components, like tranexamic acid, is possible.
