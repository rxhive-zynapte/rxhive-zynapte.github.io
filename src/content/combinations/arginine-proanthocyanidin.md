## **Usage**

- Arginine + Proanthocyanidin is prescribed as a nutritional supplement to address nutritional deficiencies, particularly during pregnancy to support fetal growth and maternal well-being.  It is also used to support cardiovascular health, improve blood flow and circulation, regulate blood sugar levels, enhance exercise performance and recovery, and promote skin and connective tissue health. It may also be used in the clinical setting to address conditions such as preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).
- **Pharmacological Classification**: Nutritional supplement.

## **Alternate Names**

- L-Arginine + Proanthocyanidin
- L-Arginine + Proanthocyanidins
-  Argipreg (Brand name)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** L-Arginine, a semi-essential amino acid, is a substrate for nitric oxide synthase, leading to nitric oxide production. Nitric oxide is a vasodilator, relaxing and widening blood vessels, thereby improving blood flow and reducing blood pressure. It may also increase growth hormone levels. Proanthocyanidin, an antioxidant, neutralizes free radicals, reduces inflammation, and protects cells from oxidative damage.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  L-arginine is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and metabolized primarily in the liver. The exact metabolism of proanthocyanidin is not fully understood. Both compounds are likely eliminated through renal and hepatic pathways.
- **Mode of Action**: L-Arginine increases nitric oxide production, which activates guanylate cyclase and increases cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), leading to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. Proanthocyanidin exerts its antioxidant effects by scavenging free radicals.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The typical dosage is one 6.5g sachet daily mixed with water or milk, or as directed by a physician.  Other dosages, such as 2-3 grams of arginine three times per day, have been studied. Dosages up to 30 grams daily have been shown to be well-tolerated in some studies, but lower dosages are typically recommended.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for children under 12 unless prescribed and monitored by a healthcare professional.
- The dosage for children 1-18 years old for arginine supplementation alone can vary from 3 to 17 mg/day depending on age, but L-Arginine + Proanthocyanidin supplements are typically only used in children in clinical settings under medical supervision.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary. Close monitoring is recommended.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Use with caution. Monitor kidney function and electrolyte levels.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Use with caution as L-arginine is metabolized in the liver.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Patients with asthma, low blood pressure, herpes, recent heart attack, or cirrhosis should use with caution or avoid use.

### **Clinical Use Cases**
Clinical use cases including during intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, intensive care, and emergency situations must be determined by a physician based on the patient's individual needs.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient factors and response to therapy.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Gastrointestinal discomfort (bloating, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting)
- Headache, dizziness
- Sleepiness, loss of appetite
- Skin rash, abdominal discomfort


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions
- Low blood pressure
- Worsening of asthma symptoms
- Electrolyte imbalances, particularly high potassium levels (hyperkalemia), especially in patients with kidney disease

### **Long-Term Effects**
Long-term effects are not well-established.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
ADRs include allergic reactions and electrolyte disturbances that require prompt medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

- Xylitol
- Herbs and supplements that may lower blood sugar, thin the blood, or increase blood pressure.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult with a healthcare professional before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. While generally considered safe for use during pregnancy for certain conditions under medical supervision, its effects during breastfeeding are not fully understood.
