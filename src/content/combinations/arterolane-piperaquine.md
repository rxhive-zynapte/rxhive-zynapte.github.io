      How does Arterolane + Piperaquine work?**


      **A:**  Arterolane rapidly kills malaria parasites by generating free

## **Usage**

- Arterolane + Piperaquine is prescribed for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria in adults and children.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Antimalarial, Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT).
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Arterolane, a synthetic trioxolane, acts rapidly to clear parasites by generating reactive oxygen species within the parasite's food vacuole, damaging vital biomolecules. Piperaquine, a bisquinoline, acts more slowly and provides longer-lasting parasite clearance, preventing recrudescence.

## **Alternate Names**

- Synriam (Brand name in India and several African countries)
- Eurartesim (International brand name)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Arterolane exerts rapid schizontocidal activity against *P. falciparum*, leading to quick symptom relief. Piperaquine has a slower onset of action but a longer half-life, providing sustained parasite clearance.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - **Arterolane:** Well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) in 4.5-5.25 hours. Metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 enzymes and eliminated quickly (half-life ~1 hour).
    - **Piperaquine:**  Good oral absorption, T<sub>max</sub> 2.5-4.5 hours. Food enhances absorption. Metabolized primarily by CYP3A4, with a long elimination half-life (around 22 days).
- **Mode of Action:** Arterolane forms reactive oxygen species within the parasite's food vacuole, disrupting essential biological processes. Piperaquine inhibits parasite heme detoxification, leading to toxic heme accumulation within the parasite.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Both drugs are primarily metabolized by hepatic CYP3A4 enzymes, with minimal renal excretion of unchanged drug.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

-  One tablet (Arterolane 150mg + Piperaquine 750mg) once daily for three consecutive days.

#### **Children (6 months to 12 years):**

- A dispersible tablet formulation (Arterolane 37.5mg/187.5mg + Piperaquine 187.5 mg/937.5 mg) is available.  Dosage is based on weight, and should be taken for 3 consecutive days with food.
- Safety and efficacy have been established in pediatric clinical trials.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution; consider renal/hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in moderate to severe impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution in moderate to severe impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with cardiac disease, especially those with prolonged QT interval or taking QT-prolonging medications.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Arterolane + Piperaquine is specifically indicated for *uncomplicated* malaria. It's *not* recommended for severe malaria, which requires parenteral therapy. Dosages for specific medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, or ICU use are not relevant as the drug is for *oral* administration in *uncomplicated* cases.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjustments may be needed in patients with moderate to severe renal or hepatic impairment.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain
- Loss of appetite
- Cough
- Dizziness, headache


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

-  QT prolongation (monitor ECG in at-risk patients)
- Hepatotoxicity (monitor liver function)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

-  Limited data available on long-term effects.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Severe allergic reactions (rare).
-  Significant QT prolongation requiring intervention.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to arterolane, piperaquine, or any component of the formulation.
- Patients with congenital long QT syndrome, or a family history of QT prolongation.
- Concomitant use with other QT-prolonging drugs.
- Severe malaria.

## **Drug Interactions**

-  Drugs that inhibit or induce CYP3A4 can alter the metabolism of both arterolane and piperaquine.
- Avoid concomitant use with other antimalarials, especially those that prolong the QT interval (e.g., halofantrine, quinine, quinidine).
-  Caution with other QT-prolonging agents (e.g., some antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics, antidepressants, antibiotics).
-  Grapefruit juice can increase piperaquine levels.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Limited data available. Not recommended in the first trimester. May be used in the second and third trimesters if the benefit outweighs the risk.
- **Breastfeeding:** Piperaquine is excreted in breast milk. Use with caution; monitor the infant for adverse effects.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Arterolane: Generates reactive oxygen species; Piperaquine: Inhibits heme detoxification.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, QT prolongation (rare).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, long QT syndrome, concomitant QT prolonging drugs.
- **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers, other antimalarials, QT-prolonging drugs.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; limited data.
- **Dosage:** Adults: One tablet daily for 3 days; Children: Dispersible tablets, weight-based dosing.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** ECG (for QT interval), Liver function tests.



## **Popular Combinations**
Arterolane and piperaquine are typically prescribed together as a fixed-dose combination, and currently there are not other clinically significant combinations.


## **Precautions**
- Screen patients for cardiac conditions,  electrolyte imbalances, and concomitant medications that may prolong the QT interval. 
- Assess liver and kidney function.
- Monitor for adverse events, particularly during the first few days of treatment.
- Avoid alcohol during treatment as its interaction with the medication is unknown.
