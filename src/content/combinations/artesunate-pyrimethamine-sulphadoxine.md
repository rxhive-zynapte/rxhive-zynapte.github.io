      What is the mechanism of action of this drug combination?**


      **A:** The combination targets multiple pathways in the malaria parasite.
      Artesunate damages the parasite through free radical formation.
      Pyrimethamine inhibits DHFR, affecting DNA synthesis. Sulfadoxine inhibits
      DHPS, further disrupting folate synthesis.

## **Usage**

- This combination drug is primarily prescribed for the **treatment of uncomplicated *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria**.  It is also used as part of combination therapy to mitigate the development of drug resistance in malaria parasites.  It should be followed by primaquine to prevent relapse in *P. vivax* and *P. ovale* malaria.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antimalarial.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination targets different stages of the malaria parasite's life cycle. Artesunate, an artemisinin derivative, generates free radicals that damage the parasite, especially during the blood stage.  Pyrimethamine inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), disrupting folic acid synthesis needed for parasite DNA replication. Sulfadoxine, a sulfonamide antibiotic, inhibits dihydropteroate synthetase (DHPS), another enzyme crucial for the parasite's folic acid production.

## **Alternate Names**

-  Artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+SP)
- SP-ACT (Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine with Artesunate)
-  Fansidar (for the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine component)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The combined action of the three drugs disrupts multiple metabolic pathways vital for the *Plasmodium* parasite's survival and reproduction, leading to its eradication.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Artesunate:** Rapidly absorbed and metabolized to its active metabolite, dihydroartemisinin (DHA).  Eliminated primarily via hepatic metabolism.
    - **Pyrimethamine:** Well-absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver and excreted through the kidneys.
    - **Sulfadoxine:**  Absorbed well orally and excreted mainly through the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:**  See "Mechanism of Action" in the Usage section above.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Pyrimethamine inhibits DHFR.  Sulfadoxine inhibits DHPS.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Artesunate is metabolized and eliminated by the liver. Pyrimethamine is metabolized in the liver and eliminated through the kidneys.  Sulfadoxine is primarily eliminated through the kidneys.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  The standard dosage is based on body weight:  Artesunate 4 mg/kg daily for 3 days, and a single dose of Sulfadoxine 25 mg/kg + Pyrimethamine 1.25 mg/kg (administered with the first dose of Artesunate). For patients â‰¥ 50 kg, the blister pack with 6 tabs AS 100 mg and 3 tabs SP 500/25 mg may be used.

#### **Children:** Dosage is weight-based. Please see detailed weight-based dosing charts in source [3]. Pediatric safety considerations include careful calculation of the dose based on weight to avoid toxicity.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution and monitor for adverse events. Dosage adjustment may be necessary based on renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution.  Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with epilepsy, asthma, blood disorders, depression, schizophrenia, severe anxiety, G6PD deficiency, colitis and porphyria.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- The combination is not indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It is specifically intended for the treatment of uncomplicated *P. falciparum* malaria.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose modifications are necessary for renal/hepatic impairment based on clinical judgment.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, abdominal pain, headache, diarrhea, fatigue, loss of appetite, skin rash.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), blood disorders (agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia), liver damage (hepatitis, liver necrosis), kidney problems (nephrosis), seizures, mental changes.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Data on long-term effects are limited.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any of the rare but serious side effects listed above require urgent medical attention.

## **Contraindications**
