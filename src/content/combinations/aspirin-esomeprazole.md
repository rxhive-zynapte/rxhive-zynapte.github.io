      Can pregnant or breastfeeding women take Aspirin + Esomeprazole?**


      **A:**  Aspirin is contraindicated in the third trimester of pregnancy.
      Esomeprazole should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit
      justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Breastfeeding is not
      recommended while taking this combination as both aspirin and esomeprazole
      can be excreted in breast milk.

      What are the long-term implications of using a PPI like esomeprazole?**


      **A:** Long-term use of PPIs has been associated with a slightly increased
      risk of bone fractures, infections (such as *C. difficile* infection), and
      vitamin B12 deficiency. These risks should be considered, especially in
      elderly patients and those with other risk factors for these conditions.

## **Usage**

Aspirin + Esomeprazole is prescribed to prevent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (like heart attack and stroke) in patients who need continuous low-dose aspirin therapy and are at risk of developing aspirin-associated gastric or duodenal ulcers.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**  This combination drug falls into two classifications:
    - Aspirin:  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID),  antiplatelet agent, analgesic (pain reliever), antipyretic (fever reducer)
    - Esomeprazole: Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)

- **Mechanism of Action:** Aspirin works by irreversibly inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), which reduces thromboxane A2 production, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation and clot formation. Esomeprazole inhibits the H+/K+ ATPase in gastric parietal cells, reducing gastric acid secretion and protecting the stomach lining from aspirin-induced damage.

## **Alternate Names**

The combination of aspirin and esomeprazole itself doesn't have an international nonproprietary name (INN).  It's known by the components' names.  Regionally, aspirin may be known as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).

- **Brand Names:**  A common brand name is Axanum (available in some regions, primarily the European Union).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Aspirin exerts antiplatelet effects, preventing clot formation. Esomeprazole suppresses gastric acid secretion.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Aspirin is rapidly absorbed in the small intestine. It is metabolized in the liver to salicylic acid, then conjugated and excreted renally.
    - Esomeprazole is also absorbed in the small intestine, but it's formulated as enteric-coated to prevent degradation in the stomach's acidic environment. It's metabolized primarily by CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4 in the liver, and the metabolites are excreted renally.

- **Mode of Action:** Aspirin irreversibly acetylates a serine residue near the active site of COX-1 in platelets, inhibiting its activity.  Esomeprazole binds to the H+/K+ ATPase (proton pump) on the luminal surface of gastric parietal cells, inhibiting acid secretion into the stomach lumen.

- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Aspirin inhibits COX-1 enzyme.  Esomeprazole inhibits the H+/K+ ATPase.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Aspirin: Renal excretion of metabolites. Esomeprazole: Renal excretion of metabolites.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  One capsule/tablet containing 81 mg or 325 mg of aspirin and 20 mg or 40 mg of esomeprazole is taken orally once a day, at least 30-60 minutes before a meal.

#### **Children:** The combination is not recommended for pediatric use.  Aspirin use in children is generally avoided due to the risk of Reye's syndrome.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** The elderly may be more susceptible to adverse effects, especially gastrointestinal bleeding, so careful monitoring is recommended. Dose adjustment might be considered based on individual patient factors.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustments are generally not necessary for esomeprazole in mild to moderate renal impairment. Caution is advised in severe renal impairment. Aspirin should be used cautiously in patients with significant renal dysfunction.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dose adjustments for esomeprazole are generally not needed in mild to moderate hepatic impairment, but in severe hepatic impairment, the daily dose should not exceed 20 mg. Aspirin should be used with caution in patients with severe liver disease.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Patients with asthma, bleeding disorders, or a history of peptic ulcers should be monitored closely.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of this combination is specifically for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients at risk of aspirin-associated ulcers. It's not indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be necessary in certain situations, as outlined above for special cases.

## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects:**

Headache, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, indigestion.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Gastrointestinal bleeding, allergic reactions (urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm), low magnesium levels (hypomagnesemia), kidney problems, severe skin reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term use of PPIs like esomeprazole may increase the risk of bone fractures, infections (such as *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea),  and vitamin B12 deficiency.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Anaphylaxis, severe bleeding, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to aspirin, NSAIDs, esomeprazole, or substituted benzimidazoles; asthma, rhinitis, nasal polyps (aspirin triad); concomitant use with rilpivirine-containing products.


## **Drug Interactions**

Aspirin can interact with anticoagulants, increasing bleeding risk. Esomeprazole can interact with clopidogrel, reducing its effectiveness. It can also affect the absorption of drugs dependent on gastric pH, such as ketoconazole and iron salts.  Both aspirin and esomeprazole can interact with other medications metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Alcohol should be avoided as it increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding with aspirin.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Aspirin is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy. Esomeprazole use during pregnancy should be limited to situations where benefit outweighs risk.

- **Fetal risks:** Aspirin can cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in the fetus.


- **Drug excretion in breast milk:**  Aspirin is excreted in breast milk and may cause Reye's syndrome in infants. Esomeprazole may also be excreted in breast milk; breastfeeding is not recommended while taking this medication.




## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Aspirin inhibits COX-1, reducing platelet aggregation. Esomeprazole inhibits the proton pump, reducing gastric acid secretion.

- **Side Effects:** Common: headache, diarrhea, abdominal pain. Serious: GI bleeding, allergic reactions, hypomagnesemia.

- **Contraindications:** Aspirin triad, hypersensitivity, concomitant use with rilpivirine.

- **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, clopidogrel, drugs metabolized by CYP2C19/3A4.


- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Aspirin is contraindicated in the third trimester.  Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking this combination.

## **Popular Combinations**

This combination itself is a popular strategy for patients requiring aspirin who are at high risk of gastrointestinal ulcers.  

## **Precautions**

Screen patients for allergies, bleeding disorders, asthma, and renal/hepatic impairment. Avoid alcohol. Advise patients to report any unusual bleeding or bruising.  Pregnant women should avoid aspirin, especially in the third trimester. Breastfeeding is not recommended.
