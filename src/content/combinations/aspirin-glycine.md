      What is the recommended dosage for Aspirin + Glycine?**


      **A:**  The typical adult dose is one tablet daily, containing 100mg
      aspirin and 45mg glycine. This can be adjusted as needed, but doses above
      300mg aspirin should be used cautiously. Pediatric use is generally
      contraindicated.

## **Usage**

Aspirin + Glycine is prescribed primarily for the prevention of heart attack and stroke in patients at risk. It's classified as an antiplatelet agent. Its mechanism of action involves inhibiting platelet aggregation and reducing the risk of blood clot formation.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Aspirin + Glycine" is a common generic name, specific brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region.  Examples of brand names containing this drug combination include Aspisol, Glyprin, and Cardiprin.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), an enzyme crucial for the synthesis of thromboxane A2, a potent platelet aggregator and vasoconstrictor.  This inhibition reduces platelet activation and "stickiness," thus decreasing the likelihood of clot formation. Glycine is believed to further enhance this effect by potentially modulating chloride channels in platelets and offering gastroprotective benefits, mitigating some of the gastrointestinal side effects of aspirin.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Aspirin is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, primarily in the small intestine, reaching peak plasma levels within 15 minutes. It is metabolized in the liver to salicylic acid, which is then further metabolized by conjugation with glycine, forming salicyluric acid. Salicylates are primarily excreted by the kidneys. Glycine, as an amino acid, is readily absorbed and metabolized through various pathways.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The standard dose is typically one tablet daily, containing 100mg aspirin and 45mg glycine. This can be adjusted up to 300 mg aspirin, depending on the patient's specific needs and the formulation used.


#### **Children:** Aspirin use in children is generally avoided due to the risk of Reye's syndrome, a serious condition affecting the brain and liver.  Aspirin + Glycine is specifically contraindicated in children under 12 years.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**:  Start with lower doses and monitor closely for adverse effects. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to gastrointestinal bleeding and other side effects.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Caution is advised, and dose adjustment might be needed based on creatinine clearance.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Dose adjustment is recommended for patients with significant liver impairment.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Careful consideration is needed for patients with conditions such as asthma, gout, peptic ulcers, or bleeding disorders.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage guidelines for specific clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, or ICU use should be based on individual patient assessment and risk stratification,  typically following standard recommendations for low-dose aspirin in these contexts.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modification may be needed based on renal/hepatic dysfunction, other comorbid conditions, concurrent medications, and individual patient response.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Indigestion, heartburn, nausea, diarrhea, easy bruising, and prolonged bleeding.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Gastrointestinal bleeding, allergic reactions (rash, breathing difficulty, angioedema), and tinnitus (ringing in the ears).

### **Long-Term Effects**

With prolonged use, an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and peptic ulcers is possible.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions and gastrointestinal bleeding represent significant ADRs that require immediate attention.



## **Contraindications**

Active peptic ulcer disease, bleeding disorders (e.g., hemophilia), hypersensitivity to aspirin or other NSAIDs, third trimester of pregnancy.


## **Drug Interactions**

Anticoagulants (warfarin, heparin), other NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen), methotrexate, some antihypertensive medications, and alcohol.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Aspirin + Glycine is generally avoided during pregnancy, especially the third trimester, due to risks of bleeding complications and premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in the fetus.  Use during breastfeeding is also generally avoided as aspirin can be excreted in breast milk and potentially affect the infant.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Irreversible COX-1 inhibition, reducing thromboxane A2 synthesis and platelet aggregation. Glycine offers potential gastroprotective and antiplatelet effects.
- **Side Effects:** Indigestion, heartburn, bleeding, allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Active peptic ulcer, bleeding disorders, hypersensitivity, third-trimester pregnancy.
- **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, NSAIDs, methotrexate, alcohol.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally avoided.
- **Dosage:** Typically 100mg aspirin + 45mg glycine daily; adjustments needed for specific situations.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Signs of bleeding, gastrointestinal symptoms, renal and liver function tests if indicated.

## **Popular Combinations**

Aspirin is sometimes combined with other antiplatelet agents like clopidogrel for enhanced antithrombotic effects, particularly after acute coronary events. This should only be done under strict medical supervision.

## **Precautions**

Assess for allergies, history of GI bleeding, renal/hepatic dysfunction, and concurrent medications. Advise patients to report any unusual bleeding or bruising. Caution patients about concomitant alcohol use, which can increase bleeding risk.
