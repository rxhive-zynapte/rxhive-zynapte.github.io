## **Usage**

Aspirin + Rosuvastatin is primarily prescribed for the prevention of cardiovascular events like myocardial infarction (heart attack) and stroke in individuals at high risk, especially those with existing coronary heart disease, diabetes, or peripheral vascular disease. It is also used to lower elevated cholesterol levels (hyperlipidemia or dyslipidemia).

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Rosuvastatin: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin), antihyperlipidemic.
* Aspirin: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), antiplatelet, analgesic, antipyretic.

**Mechanism of Action:**

Rosuvastatin inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme crucial for cholesterol synthesis in the liver. This reduces LDL cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing HDL cholesterol. Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversibly blocking cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), thereby reducing thrombus formation and improving blood flow.


## **Alternate Names** 

There are no officially recognized alternate names for this combination.  It is generally referred to as "Aspirin + Rosuvastatin" or “Rosuvastatin and Aspirin”.

**Brand Names:**

Several brand names exist for this combination, with specific formulations varying by dosage. Some examples include: Roustrin AV 10/20 and Danavish.



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

Rosuvastatin reduces cholesterol biosynthesis and increases LDL receptor expression, leading to decreased LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and increased HDL cholesterol. Aspirin inhibits COX-1, reducing thromboxane A2 production and platelet aggregation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* Rosuvastatin: Primarily metabolized by the liver (CYP2C9), excreted mainly in bile and feces, some renal excretion.
* Aspirin: Rapidly hydrolyzed to salicylic acid, which is conjugated and excreted renally.

**Mode of Action:**

* Rosuvastatin: Competitively inhibits HMG-CoA reductase at its active site.
* Aspirin: Acetylates a serine residue in the active site of COX-1.

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Rosuvastatin: HMG-CoA reductase inhibition. Aspirin: COX-1 inhibition.

**Elimination pathways:** Rosuvastatin: Hepatic metabolism (CYP2C9), biliary and fecal excretion, some renal excretion. Aspirin: Renal excretion of salicylic acid and its metabolites.



## **Dosage**

Dosage is individualized based on patient factors, including cardiovascular risk, cholesterol levels, and comorbidities. There's no fixed combination of Rosuvastatin and Aspirin marketed, so they are typically prescribed separately and taken concurrently.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* Rosuvastatin: 5-40 mg orally once daily.
* Aspirin (for cardiovascular prevention): 75-150 mg orally once daily.

#### **Children:**

Rosuvastatin is approved for use in children 8 years and older with familial hypercholesterolemia. The safety and efficacy in other pediatric populations have not been established. Aspirin is generally avoided in children due to the risk of Reye's syndrome.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients**: Start with a lower dose and monitor closely.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Dose adjustment may be necessary for severe impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Use with caution; dose adjustment may be needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Close monitoring is essential.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

In clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations, the decision to administer or continue Aspirin + Rosuvastatin is made on a case-by-case basis, considering the patient's specific circumstances and cardiovascular risk versus bleeding risk.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on patient-specific factors like renal/hepatic function, concomitant medications, and response to therapy.  Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism may also require dosage adjustments.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

* Myalgia
* Headache
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Increased bleeding tendency


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Rhabdomyolysis
* Hepatotoxicity
* Gastrointestinal bleeding

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term use of statins may increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.  Chronic aspirin use can lead to gastrointestinal complications.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

* Angioedema
* Severe allergic reactions


## **Contraindications**

* Active liver disease
* Pregnancy
* Breastfeeding
* Hypersensitivity to aspirin or rosuvastatin


## **Drug Interactions**

* Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin): Increased bleeding risk.
* Some cholesterol-lowering drugs (e.g., gemfibrozil, fenofibrate): Increased risk of myopathy.
* Some immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine): Increased rosuvastatin levels.
* Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Aspirin + Rosuvastatin is contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
