## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as a dietary supplement to support male fertility and address nutritional deficiencies. It is not classified under a specific pharmacological class like antibiotics or analgesics.  It works by providing essential nutrients that contribute to various physiological functions, particularly those related to sperm health and antioxidant defense.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is marketed under various brand names, including New Alene, Qutacare M, Carnimed Plus, and Zonlixy.  Some alternate names for individual components include ubiquinol (Coenzyme Q10) and levocarnitine (Levo-carnitine).

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** This combination exerts its effects through the synergistic action of its components:

* **Astaxanthin:** A potent antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative damage.
* **Coenzyme Q10:** Essential for cellular energy production and also acts as an antioxidant.
* **Levo-carnitine:** Facilitates fatty acid transport into mitochondria for energy production, contributing to sperm motility. It also exhibits antioxidant properties.
* **Lycopene:** An antioxidant that protects against cell damage.
* **Piperine:** Enhances the bioavailability of other nutrients in the formulation.
* **Selenium:**  Important for various bodily functions, including thyroid hormone metabolism and antioxidant defense. Crucial for sperm development and motility.
* **Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate:** Provides zinc, essential for immune function, cell growth, reproductive health, and testosterone production.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The pharmacokinetics of this combination are complex due to the multiple components. Each component has its own absorption, metabolism, and elimination profile. Piperine enhances the absorption of some components.  Generally, these nutrients are metabolized in the liver and excreted through urine and feces.

**Mode of Action:** The components primarily act by:

* **Antioxidant activity:** Protecting cells from oxidative stress, a key factor in male infertility.
* **Improving energy production:** Enhancing mitochondrial function to improve sperm motility.
* **Enhancing nutrient bioavailability:** Piperine increases the absorption of other components, maximizing their effects.
