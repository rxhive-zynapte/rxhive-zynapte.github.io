## **Usage**

This combination of ingredients is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to support overall health and wellness. It is often marketed for boosting energy levels, promoting speedy recovery, and improving metabolism.  It's prescribed for nutritional deficiencies, particularly those affecting energy production, muscle function, and antioxidant status. This combination doesn't fall neatly into a single pharmacological classification, but rather addresses multiple physiological processes.  It could be considered a metabolic agent, antioxidant, and vitamin/mineral supplement.

The mechanism of action is multifaceted due to the different components:

* **Astaxanthin:** A potent antioxidant that protects cells from damage.
* **Coenzyme Q10:**  Essential for energy production within cells.
* **Levo-carnitine:**  Facilitates fatty acid transport for energy generation.
* **Magnesium Sulphate:** Involved in numerous enzymatic reactions, muscle function, and nerve transmission.
* **Vitamin K2-7:** Plays a role in calcium metabolism and bone health.
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:** Essential for immune function, cell growth, and wound healing.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no officially recognized alternate name for this specific combination. It is often referred to by brand names. Some possible brand names (though not exhaustive) include Coquet 10.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

The effects of this combination are derived from the synergistic action of its individual components.  Astaxanthin and Coenzyme Q10 act as antioxidants, protecting cellular structures from oxidative stress. Levocarnitine enhances energy production by aiding in fatty acid transport.  Magnesium is crucial for various enzymatic reactions, including those involved in energy metabolism. Vitamin K2-7 contributes to calcium homeostasis. Zinc supports immune function and cell growth.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion vary for each component.  Coenzyme Q10 absorption can be enhanced by fats. Levocarnitine is absorbed in the small intestine.  Magnesium absorption is influenced by dietary factors.  Vitamin K2-7 is absorbed in the presence of bile salts. Zinc is absorbed mainly in the small intestine.  Excretion routes differ as well, with some components eliminated primarily by the kidneys (magnesium, zinc) while others undergo hepatic metabolism (CoQ10, vitamin K).

**Mode of Action:**

* **Astaxanthin:** Scavenges free radicals, protecting cell membranes and DNA from oxidative damage.
* **Coenzyme Q10:**  Participates in the electron transport chain within mitochondria, crucial for ATP synthesis.
* **Levo-carnitine:** Transports long-chain fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane for beta-oxidation and energy production.
* **Magnesium Sulphate:** Acts as a cofactor for numerous enzymes, including those involved in energy metabolism, protein synthesis, and muscle contraction.
* **Vitamin K2-7:**  Modifies proteins involved in calcium metabolism, including osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein, influencing bone mineralization and calcium deposition in blood vessels.
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:**  Plays a structural role in many enzymes and transcription factors, influencing immune cell function, cell growth, and DNA synthesis.
