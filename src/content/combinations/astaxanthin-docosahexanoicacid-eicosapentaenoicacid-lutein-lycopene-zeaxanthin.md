## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as a dietary supplement to support overall health, particularly eye health.  It is not classified as a pharmaceutical drug and thus doesn't fall under a specific pharmacological classification like antibiotics or analgesics. Instead, it's considered a nutraceutical.

The individual components have specific functions: Astaxanthin, lutein, lycopene, and zeaxanthin act as antioxidants, protecting cells from oxidative stress. Lutein and zeaxanthin concentrate in the eye's macula, filtering harmful blue light and potentially reducing age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataract risk. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are omega-3 fatty acids crucial for cell membrane integrity, anti-inflammatory processes, and cholesterol regulation. DHA is particularly important for brain and eye health.

## **Alternate Names**

There's no official alternate name for this specific combination. DHA and EPA are often referred to as omega-3 fatty acids.  Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer. Some sources mention "Briyo OptiVital" as an example.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The combination works through synergistic actions of its components:

* **Antioxidant Effects:** Astaxanthin, lutein, lycopene, and zeaxanthin neutralize free radicals, protecting cells from oxidative damage.
* **Eye Health:** Lutein and zeaxanthin accumulate in the macula, acting as a natural blue light filter. DHA supports retinal function.
* **Anti-inflammatory and Lipid-Lowering Effects:** EPA and DHA exert anti-inflammatory effects and may contribute to triglyceride reduction and HDL cholesterol elevation.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Absorption, metabolism, and elimination haven't been studied extensively for this specific combination. Individually, each component has distinct pharmacokinetic properties.

* **Carotenoids (astaxanthin, lutein, lycopene, zeaxanthin):** Absorbed with fats in the diet, metabolized in the liver, and eliminated through bile and feces.
* **Omega-3 fatty acids (DHA, EPA):** Absorbed in the small intestine, incorporated into cell membranes, and metabolized like other fatty acids.


## **Dosage**

Standardized dosing guidelines are not established for this combination as it's a dietary supplement. Recommendations vary widely based on product formulation and individual needs.

### **Standard Dosage**
