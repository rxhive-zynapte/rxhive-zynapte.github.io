## **Usage**

- This fixed-dose combination medication is prescribed for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and children. It is not a cure for HIV, but it helps manage the infection and slow its progression.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antiretroviral (combination of a protease inhibitor, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and a pharmacokinetic enhancer).
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination targets multiple stages of the HIV-1 replication cycle.  Atazanavir is a protease inhibitor that blocks the HIV protease enzyme, preventing the formation of mature infectious viral particles. Emtricitabine and Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) that interfere with the conversion of viral RNA to DNA. Ritonavir acts as a pharmacokinetic enhancer, or booster, by inhibiting the metabolism of atazanavir, thereby increasing its concentration in the blood and prolonging its therapeutic effect.

## **Alternate Names**

No commonly used alternate names for this specific combination product exist as such, although generic versions may be available. 
Brand names vary by region.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  The combination of these drugs inhibits HIV replication by targeting different viral enzymes essential for its life cycle, leading to a decrease in the viral load. Ritonavir boosts atazanavir levels, leading to more sustained antiviral activity.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** All components are absorbed orally. Food can impact the absorption of atazanavir.
    - **Metabolism:** Atazanavir is primarily metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme system in the liver; ritonavir inhibits CYP3A4, thus boosting atazanavir concentrations. Emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily eliminated by the kidneys.
    - **Elimination:** Atazanavir is eliminated primarily through the feces, while emtricitabine, tenofovir, and ritonavir are eliminated through urine.

- **Mode of Action:**
    - Atazanavir: Inhibits HIV-1 protease by binding to its active site.
    - Emtricitabine and Tenofovir: Act as competitive substrates for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and, after phosphorylation, terminate the DNA chain.
    - Ritonavir: Primarily acts as a CYP3A4 inhibitor but also has some antiretroviral activity itself.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**
#### Adults:
300mg of Atazanavir + 100mg of Ritonavir + 200mg of Emtricitabine + 300mg of Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate as a single fixed-dose combination tablet once daily with food. 

#### Children:
Refer to individual drug dosing guidelines for weight-based or age-based calculations, as a fixed-dose combination may not be available.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** Monitor renal function. Dosage adjustments may be needed based on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Requires dose adjustment for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine. Consult specific guidelines and monitor renal function closely.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Exercise caution and monitor liver function tests. Reduced doses of atazanavir may be necessary. 
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate concomitant medications for potential drug interactions. Dose adjustments may be needed depending upon the condition and concomitant medications.



### **Clinical Use Cases**  Dosage in specific clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations would be consistent with the standard recommendations for HIV treatment, adjusting as needed for drug interactions or organ dysfunction.

### **Dosage Adjustments** Modifications are based on renal/hepatic impairment, drug interactions, and other patient-specific factors. Always consult guidelines.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, skin rash, jaundice, and changes in body fat distribution.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:** Liver damage, kidney problems, pancreatitis, allergic reactions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, heart rhythm abnormalities (including QT prolongation), and lactic acidosis.

### **Long-Term Effects:**  Dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, diabetes, osteoporosis, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication.
- Severe hepatic impairment.
- Co-administration with drugs that prolong the QT interval and are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance.
- Use with caution in patients with a history of kidney disease, diabetes, or pancreatitis.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Several significant drug interactions exist. Always consult an interaction checker for specific combinations. 
- Notable interactions include PPIs (proton pump inhibitors), antacids, H2 blockers, certain antiarrhythmics, anticonvulsants, and some herbal supplements (e.g., St. John's wort).



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

This combination can be used during pregnancy, but careful monitoring is necessary.  It is recommended that HIV-positive mothers do not breastfeed to avoid transmission to the infant.
