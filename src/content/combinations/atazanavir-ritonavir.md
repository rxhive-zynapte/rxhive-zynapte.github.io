      What if a patient misses a dose of Atazanavir + Ritonavir?**

      **A:** If a dose is missed within 12 hours of the usual time, it should be
      taken with food as soon as possible. If it is closer to the time of the
      next dose, the missed dose should be skipped, and the patient should
      resume their regular dosing schedule. Double dosing should be avoided.

## **Usage**

- Atazanavir + Ritonavir is prescribed, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and children 6 years and older weighing at least 15 kg.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Antiretroviral, Protease inhibitor.  Ritonavir acts as a pharmacokinetic booster, increasing  atazanavir plasma levels.
- **Mechanism of action:** Atazanavir selectively inhibits the viral protease enzyme, preventing cleavage of viral polyproteins and  immature, noninfectious viral particles. Ritonavir inhibits the metabolism of atazanavir, thus boosting its plasma concentrations.

## **Alternate Names**

- Atazanavir sulfate/Ritonavir
- **Brand names:** Reyataz (atazanavir), Norvir (ritonavir), Evotaz (atazanavir/ritonavir)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Atazanavir inhibits HIV-1 protease, resulting in the formation of immature, non-infectious virions. Ritonavir, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, boosts the levels of Atazanavir by reducing its metabolism.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Atazanavir is well absorbed orally, particularly when administered with food. It is primarily metabolized by the liver, specifically by CYP3A4. Ritonavir significantly inhibits CYP3A4-mediated metabolism, significantly increasing atazanavir exposure. Atazanavir is primarily eliminated in the feces, with a smaller portion excreted in the urine. Ritonavir is also metabolized by CYP3A4 and primarily eliminated in the feces.
- **Mode of action:** Atazanavir binds to the active site of the HIV-1 protease enzyme, preventing it from cleaving viral polyproteins, which are essential for the maturation of new virus particles. 
- **Elimination pathways:** Atazanavir primarily undergoes hepatic metabolism by CYP3A enzymes (mainly CYP3A4) and is excreted in the feces. Ritonavir undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, also primarily by CYP3A4, with primarily fecal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Treatment-naive: Atazanavir 300 mg + Ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food.
- Treatment-experienced: Atazanavir 300 mg + Ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food.
- Unable to tolerate Ritonavir (treatment-naive only): Atazanavir 400 mg once daily with food.

#### **Children (6 years and older, weighing at least 15 kg):**

- Body weight 15 kg to less than 35 kg: Atazanavir 200 mg + Ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food.
- Body weight at least 35 kg: Atazanavir 300 mg + Ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food.
- Pediatric patients less than 6 years: Check available formulations with lower Atazanavir and Ritonavir content.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustment is required unless there is renal or hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment required unless the patient is treatment-experienced and on hemodialysis. Treatment is not recommended in this specific case.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. In treatment-naive adults, Atazanavir without Ritonavir is recommended at a dose of 400mg for Child-Pugh A and 300mg for Child-Pugh B. Atazanavir with ritonavir is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Patients with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hemophilia should be monitored closely due to potential exacerbation of these conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Atazanavir + Ritonavir is indicated for chronic HIV management and not typically used in acute clinical situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU care, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dosage adjustments may be necessary in specific situations, such as:
    - Coadministration with acid-reducing agents (H2-receptor antagonists, proton-pump inhibitors): Adjust Atazanavir dose as needed or switch the acid-reducing agent.
    - Coadministration with other antiretroviral drugs (e.g., efavirenz, tenofovir): Adjust doses as necessary. 
    - Hepatic impairment: Modify Atazanavir dosage.
    - Pregnancy: No dose adjustment needed, except for the specific cases outlined above.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Atazanavir and Ritonavir are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 can affect their plasma concentrations:
    - CYP3A4 inducers (rifampin, St. John's wort): decrease atazanavir and ritonavir levels.
    - CYP3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole): increase atazanavir and ritonavir levels.
- Antacids: Separate administration by at least 2 hours.
- H2-receptor antagonists (e.g., famotidine, ranitidine): Adjust dosing time and/or atazanavir dose.
- Proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole, lansoprazole): Adjust dosing time and/or atazanavir dose.
- Other antiretrovirals (e.g., efavirenz, tenofovir, didanosine): Adjust doses as needed.
- Drugs that prolong the QT interval (amiodarone, quinidine): Use with caution and monitor.
- Hormonal contraceptives: Atazanavir/Ritonavir may decrease the effectiveness; alternative contraception recommended.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

-  Atazanavir + Ritonavir can be used during pregnancy but should be used with caution and monitoring, especially regarding jaundice in neonates.
