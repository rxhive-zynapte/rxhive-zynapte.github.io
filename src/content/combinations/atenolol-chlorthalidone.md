## **Usage**

Atenolol + Chlorthalidone is primarily prescribed for **hypertension** (high blood pressure). It is not recommended for initial therapy but is used when a single-agent therapy is ineffective. It may be more convenient than taking the individual components separately if the fixed-dose combination meets the patient's needs.  It belongs to the **antihypertensive** pharmacological class, specifically a combination of a **beta-blocker** and a **thiazide diuretic**.

Atenolol, a beta-blocker, works by blocking the effects of epinephrine (adrenaline) on the heart, leading to a slower heart rate and reduced force of contraction, which lowers blood pressure. Chlorthalidone, a thiazide diuretic, increases the excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys, reducing blood volume and consequently blood pressure.  The combined effect results in better blood pressure control than either drug alone in some patients.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is often referred to as a beta-blocker/thiazide combination.  A popular brand name is **Tenoretic**.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Atenolol reduces heart rate, cardiac output, and renin release. Chlorthalidone decreases blood volume through diuresis, reducing peripheral vascular resistance.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  
* **Atenolol:**  Incompletely absorbed orally (50-60%). Minimal first-pass metabolism.  Peak plasma concentrations occur in 2-4 hours. Half-life is 6-9 hours, longer in renal impairment. Primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys.
* **Chlorthalidone:** Well absorbed orally. Peak plasma concentrations are reached in 4-6 hours.  Half-life of 40-60 hours.  Primarily excreted unchanged in urine.

**Mode of Action:** Atenolol competitively blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, reducing sympathetic stimulation. Chlorthalidone inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron.

**Elimination:** Atenolol primarily via renal excretion. Chlorthalidone is eliminated primarily unchanged in urine.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Initial dose: 50 mg Atenolol/25 mg Chlorthalidone orally once daily.  
Maintenance dose: May be increased to 100 mg Atenolol/25 mg Chlorthalidone orally once daily if needed. If response is inadequate, another antihypertensive may be added.


#### **Children:**

Safety and efficacy not established in patients younger than 18 years.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Initiate at lower doses and titrate cautiously due to increased risk of adverse effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for moderate to severe renal impairment.  Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) 15-35 mL/min/1.73 m²: Maximum 50 mg atenolol daily. CrCl <15 mL/min/1.73 m²: Maximum 25 mg atenolol daily or 50 mg every other day. Anuria is a contraindication.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution, dosage adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider comorbidities like diabetes or other cardiovascular disease. Atenolol may mask symptoms of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Atenolol + Chlorthalidone is not typically used for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Other medications are more appropriate in these settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are necessary for renal impairment. Titrate cautiously in elderly patients. Individualize dosage based on patient response and tolerability.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, nausea, impotence, cold extremities.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Bradycardia, heart block, bronchospasm, worsening of peripheral vascular disease, electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hyponatremia).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Electrolyte disturbances, metabolic changes.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe bradycardia, hypotension, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis.

## **Contraindications**

* Bradycardia, second or third-degree heart block, cardiogenic shock, overt heart failure.
* Bronchospastic pulmonary disease (asthma, COPD).
* Severe peripheral vascular disease.
* Anuria.
* Hypersensitivity to sulfonamide-derived drugs.
* Concomitant use of MAO inhibitors.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Calcium channel blockers:** May enhance negative chronotropic and inotropic effects.
* **Digoxin:** May increase risk of bradycardia.
* **Insulin, oral hypoglycemics:** May mask signs of hypoglycemia.
* **NSAIDs:** May decrease antihypertensive efficacy.
* **Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine):** May cause excessive hypotension.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Atenolol crosses the placenta and is present in breast milk. Chlorthalidone also crosses the placenta and is present in breast milk. Use only if clearly needed and the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus or infant.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Beta-blocker and thiazide diuretic combination.
* **Side Effects:** Dizziness, fatigue, bradycardia, electrolyte disturbances.
* **Contraindications:** Bradycardia, heart block, heart failure, bronchospastic disease, anuria.
* **Drug Interactions:** Calcium channel blockers, digoxin, insulin.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
* **Dosage:** 50/25 mg once daily, may increase to 100/25 mg once daily.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, heart rate, electrolytes (potassium, sodium).


## **Popular Combinations**

Often used alone or with other antihypertensives if the combination alone is insufficient.

## **Precautions**

* Monitor renal and hepatic function, electrolytes, and blood glucose (diabetics).
* Caution in patients with asthma, COPD, or peripheral vascular disease.
* Gradually discontinue to avoid rebound hypertension.
