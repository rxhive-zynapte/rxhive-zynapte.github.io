## **Usage**

- This combination medication is prescribed to lower high cholesterol and triglyceride levels in individuals with mixed dyslipidemia, primary hypercholesterolemia (both heterozygous familial and non-familial), homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), or severe hypertriglyceridemia. It is also beneficial in managing patients who have high cholesterol, high triglycerides, and low HDL (good cholesterol) levels. It can be prescribed as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments, such as LDL apheresis in patients with HoFH.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Lipid-lowering agent (combination of a statin, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, and a fibrate).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Atorvastatin inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme essential for cholesterol synthesis in the liver, thereby reducing LDL cholesterol production. Ezetimibe inhibits cholesterol absorption in the small intestine. Fenofibrate activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), which increases lipoprotein lipase activity, leading to triglyceride breakdown and a modest increase in HDL cholesterol.


## **Alternate Names**

- No internationally recognized non-proprietary name exists for this specific combination.  It is often referred to as the combination of its individual components: Atorvastatin, Ezetimibe, and Fenofibrate.
- **Brand Names:** Several brand names exist for combinations of two of these medications (e.g., Liptruzet for Atorvastatin + Ezetimibe), but a single brand name for the triple combination is not widely recognized. Availability may vary regionally depending on local regulations and pharmaceutical manufacturers.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Atorvastatin lowers LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and slightly raises HDL cholesterol. Ezetimibe decreases cholesterol absorption from the intestines. Fenofibrate primarily lowers triglycerides and moderately increases HDL cholesterol. The combined action provides a more comprehensive lipid-lowering effect than each drug alone.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  
    - **Absorption:** All three drugs are orally administered and absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract.  Atorvastatin's absorption is enhanced with food, while ezetimibe and fenofibrate can be taken with or without food.
    - **Metabolism:** Atorvastatin is extensively metabolized by the liver via CYP3A4 enzymes. Ezetimibe is also metabolized in the liver but to a lesser extent and forms an active metabolite. Fenofibrate is metabolized to fenofibric acid, its active form.
    - **Elimination:** Atorvastatin and its metabolites are primarily eliminated in bile and feces, with a small portion excreted in urine. Ezetimibe is eliminated through both biliary and urinary pathways. Fenofibrate is mainly excreted in the urine.
- **Mode of Action:**  Atorvastatin inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, resulting in reduced cholesterol production. Ezetimibe inhibits the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) transporter protein, thus reducing cholesterol absorption. Fenofibrate, through PPARα activation, increases lipoprotein lipase activity, which breaks down triglycerides. It also promotes triglyceride clearance from the plasma and may increase HDL synthesis.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**
    - Atorvastatin: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.
    - Ezetimibe: NPC1L1 transporter inhibitor.
    - Fenofibrate: PPARα agonist.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  
    - Atorvastatin: Primarily biliary excretion.
    - Ezetimibe: Biliary and renal excretion.
    - Fenofibrate: Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Dosing should be individualized based on patient response and lipid goals.  Typical starting doses might involve using the standard doses of the individual components (e.g., Atorvastatin 10-20 mg, Ezetimibe 10 mg, and Fenofibrate 145 mg). However, commercially available fixed-dose combinations may not reflect these exact dosages.  Titration should be based on lipid panel results.

#### **Children:**  The safety and efficacy of this triple combination have not been established in children younger than 10 years of age for Atorvastatin + Ezetimibe or younger than 12 years of age for combinations with fenofibrate. For children 10 years and older, dosing should be determined by the doctor.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate at lower doses and titrate cautiously, monitoring closely for adverse events like myopathy.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustment of Atorvastatin and Fenofibrate may be necessary in moderate to severe renal impairment. Ezetimibe dose adjustment is usually not required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** This combination should generally be avoided in patients with active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations in transaminases. Dose reduction might be necessary in mild hepatic impairment, but moderate to severe hepatic impairment is generally a contraindication.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring is recommended, especially for patients with diabetes, hypothyroidism, gallbladder disease, or a history of muscle disorders.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use/Emergency Situations:**  No specific dosage recommendations exist for these settings with this triple combination.  Lipid management may not be prioritized during acute situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments are based on individual patient factors like renal/hepatic function, comorbidities, concomitant medications, and treatment response. Close monitoring of lipid panels and potential adverse events is necessary when adjusting doses.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Headache, nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain, joint pain, muscle aches, increased liver enzymes, increased blood glucose.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Myopathy/rhabdomyolysis (muscle damage), hepatitis (liver inflammation), pancreatitis (pancreatic inflammation), allergic reactions including angioedema.


### **Long-Term Effects**

- Muscle weakness, liver dysfunction, gallbladder issues.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Angioedema, myopathy progressing to rhabdomyolysis, acute liver injury, severe allergic reactions.


## **Contraindications**

- Active liver disease, unexplained persistent elevations in serum transaminases, severe hepatic or renal impairment, pre-existing gallbladder disease, pregnancy, breastfeeding, hypersensitivity to any component of the medication. Concurrent use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or cyclosporine may require careful consideration and potential contraindication depending on the situation.


## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:**  Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, grapefruit juice) can increase atorvastatin levels, increasing the risk of myopathy. Dose reduction or alternative medications may be required.
- **Fibrates (gemfibrozil):** Co-administration increases the risk of myopathy, especially with atorvastatin.
- **Bile Acid Sequestrants (cholestyramine, colestipol, colesevelam):**  Separate administration by at least 2 hours before or 4 hours after the bile acid sequestrant.
- **Other:** Cyclosporine, danazol, amiodarone, verapamil, diltiazem, warfarin, digoxin, certain antibiotics and antivirals may interact with one or more components of this combination. Consult a drug interaction database for details.
- **Food and Lifestyle Factors:** Grapefruit juice should be avoided.  Alcohol intake should be limited due to the potential for additive liver toxicity.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** X (contraindicated). Atorvastatin and Ezetimibe are contraindicated in pregnancy due to the potential for fetal harm. Fenofibrate use is also discouraged due to the lack of safety data.
- **Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated. Atorvastatin, Ezetimibe, and Fenofibrate may pass into breast milk and have the potential for serious adverse effects in infants. Women should not breastfeed while taking this combination.
