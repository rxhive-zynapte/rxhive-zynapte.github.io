## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed to lower high cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the blood when lifestyle modifications (diet and exercise) are insufficient. It is specifically indicated for patients with mixed dyslipidemia or hyperlipidemia, conditions characterized by elevated levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.  It's crucial to note that this particular combination is not approved by the FDA and is primarily available in certain regions like India.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Lipid-lowering agent (combination drug) and Vitamin (Folic acid component).

**Mechanism of Action:** This fixed-dose combination (FDC) works synergistically through its components:

* **Atorvastatin:** Inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme essential for cholesterol synthesis in the liver, leading to a reduction in LDL cholesterol.
* **Fenofibrate:** Activates PPAR-α, modulating lipid metabolism, leading to lower triglycerides and elevated HDL cholesterol levels.
* **Folic Acid:** Reduces homocysteine levels, a factor potentially contributing to elevated cholesterol.

## **Alternate Names**

* AFF Tablet
* Atorvastatin/Fenofibrate/Folic Acid Fixed-Dose Combination (FDC)
* Inovas-F (Atorvastatin + Fenofibrate)
* Orvas-FT (Atorvastatin + Fenofibrate)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Atorvastatin lowers LDL cholesterol by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase. Fenofibrate lowers triglycerides and raises HDL cholesterol by activating PPAR-α. Folic acid reduces homocysteine levels.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Atorvastatin:** Well-absorbed orally, metabolized by CYP3A4, excreted in bile.
* **Fenofibrate:** Well-absorbed orally, extensively metabolized, primarily excreted in urine.
* **Folic Acid:** Absorbed in the small intestine, converted to active forms, eliminated renally and in bile.


**Mode of Action:**  Atorvastatin acts through competitive inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, while Fenofibrate acts as a PPAR-α agonist. Folic acid, a B vitamin, plays a role in various metabolic processes, including homocysteine metabolism.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Atorvastatin inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. Fenofibrate activates PPAR-α receptors.


**Elimination Pathways:** Atorvastatin is primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion. Fenofibrate is eliminated predominantly through urine. Folic Acid is eliminated through both renal and biliary routes.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The common starting dose is one tablet of Atorvastatin 10 mg/Fenofibrate 160 mg/Folic Acid 5 mg taken orally once daily with the evening meal. The dosage may be adjusted according to individual response and lipid levels, with the maximum dose of Atorvastatin generally not exceeding 80mg per day, and the maximum dose of Fenofibrate being 200mg per day.


#### **Children:** This combination is *not* recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age due to lack of established safety and efficacy data.



#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower Atorvastatin dose (e.g., 10 mg daily) and titrate cautiously, monitoring renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce Fenofibrate dose for creatinine clearance <50 mL/min.  No dose reduction is needed for moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50-90 mL/min), however monitor closely.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Closely monitor liver function tests (LFTs) and adjust dosage accordingly. Contraindicated in active liver disease.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring of blood glucose in diabetic patients is needed. Caution is advised in patients with pre-existing gallbladder disease.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources do not specify dosages for specific medical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. The primary use of this combination is for chronic management of dyslipidemia.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are determined by the patient's response to therapy and tolerability. Regular monitoring of lipid panels and liver function is crucial, and renal function should be assessed, especially in the elderly and those with known renal impairment.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Nausea
* Constipation
* Flatulence
* Indigestion
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain

### **Long-Term Effects:**

* Increased risk of gallstones (with Fenofibrate)

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any signs of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis (muscle pain, tenderness, weakness), hepatotoxicity (jaundice, dark urine), or allergic reactions (rash, swelling) necessitate immediate discontinuation and medical evaluation.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any component
* Active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations in LFTs
* Gallbladder disease
* Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min for Atorvastatin, <50 mL/min for Fenofibrate)
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Fibrates (gemfibrozil):** Increased risk of myopathy
* **Certain antibiotics (clarithromycin, erythromycin):** Increased statin levels
* **Oral contraceptives:** Increased risk of contraceptive-related side effects

* **Immunosuppressants (cyclosporine):** Increased statin levels
* **Grapefruit juice:** Inhibits statin metabolism
* **Alcohol:** Increased risk of liver damage


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

This medication is **contraindicated** during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential fetal risks.  Atorvastatin is classified as Pregnancy Category X. It is advisable to avoid fenofibrate and folic acid during pregnancy unless benefits significantly outweigh risks.  It is unknown whether these drugs are excreted in breast milk. Safe alternatives should be considered during these periods.
