## **Usage**

- Atorvastatin + Fenofibrate is prescribed for the treatment of mixed dyslipidemia (elevated total cholesterol, LDL-C, triglycerides, and low HDL-C) and severe hypertriglyceridemia in adults.  It is particularly beneficial for patients with type 2 diabetes and combined hyperlipidemia who do not achieve optimal lipid control with statin monotherapy.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Lipid-lowering agent (combination of a statin and a fibrate).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Atorvastatin inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme crucial for cholesterol synthesis, thereby reducing LDL-C levels. Fenofibrate activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α), which increases lipoprotein lipase activity, leading to increased triglyceride breakdown and HDL-C elevation.


## **Alternate Names**

- Atorvastatin/Fenofibrate fixed-dose combination.
- **Brand Names:** Several brand names exist depending on the region; examples include Fenostat, Lipofen, Antara, and others.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Atorvastatin lowers LDL-C, total cholesterol, and triglycerides.  Fenofibrate lowers triglycerides, raises HDL-C, and modestly reduces LDL-C. The combination exerts synergistic effects on lipid parameters.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Atorvastatin is well-absorbed orally and extensively metabolized by CYP3A4.  Fenofibrate is a prodrug hydrolyzed to fenofibric acid (the active form). Fenofibric acid is highly protein-bound and mainly conjugated with glucuronic acid. Both drugs are primarily eliminated through hepatic mechanisms, with some renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** Atorvastatin competitively inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, blocking cholesterol synthesis. Fenofibrate, via PPAR-α activation, upregulates lipoprotein lipase, which hydrolyzes triglycerides in VLDL and chylomicrons, leading to their clearance; it also increases Apo A-I and A-II synthesis, promoting HDL formation.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Atorvastatin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and excreted in bile. Fenofibrate, as fenofibric acid, is conjugated and excreted in urine and bile.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: Atorvastatin 10 mg + Fenofibrate 160 mg (or Fenofibrate 200 mg depending on the formulation) once daily with a meal.
- Titration: The dose can be up-titrated based on lipid response and tolerability, up to a maximum of Atorvastatin 40 mg + Fenofibrate 160/200 mg once daily.

#### **Children:**

- The fixed-dose combination is not recommended for patients under 18 years of age due to lack of clinical data.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and adjust according to renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Contraindicated in severe renal impairment.  Lower initial doses are recommended in mild to moderate renal impairment, with careful monitoring.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment (active liver disease or decompensated cirrhosis). Use with caution and monitor liver function in mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific dosage adjustment is necessary for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc., but careful monitoring is essential.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- This drug combination is not typically used in acute clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It focuses on long-term lipid management for chronic conditions.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Renal/hepatic impairment requires dose reduction or avoidance, respectively. 
- Concomitant medications that interact with CYP3A4 may necessitate atorvastatin dose adjustment.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Digestive issues (e.g., abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, nausea).
- Myalgia.
- Headache.
- Increased liver enzymes.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Myopathy/rhabdomyolysis.
- Hepatotoxicity.
- Pancreatitis.
- Cholelithiasis.

### **Long-Term Effects**

-  Potential for chronic liver or muscle damage with long-term use. Regular monitoring of liver function tests and creatine kinase is crucial.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

-  Rhabdomyolysis, acute liver injury, and pancreatitis require immediate discontinuation of therapy and supportive care.



## **Contraindications**

- Severe hepatic or renal impairment.
- Active liver disease or gallbladder disease.
- Hypersensitivity to atorvastatin or fenofibrate.
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding.


## **Drug Interactions**

- CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics) can increase atorvastatin levels, potentially leading to myopathy.
- Cyclosporine, certain HIV protease inhibitors, and some HCV protease inhibitors increase the risk of myopathy when combined with atorvastatin.
- Bile acid sequestrants may decrease atorvastatin absorption.
- Concomitant use with gemfibrozil significantly increases the risk of myopathy. Fenofibrate is preferred over gemfibrozil when combining a statin with a fibrate.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** X (contraindicated).
- Fetal risks: Statins are teratogenic and should be avoided during pregnancy. Fenofibrate also carries potential fetal risks.
- Breastfeeding: Both drugs are excreted in breast milk and should not be used during breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Atorvastatin inhibits HMG-CoA reductase; Fenofibrate activates PPAR-α.
- **Side Effects:**  Myalgia, digestive upset, increased liver enzymes; rarely, myopathy/rhabdomyolysis, hepatotoxicity.
- **Contraindications:** Severe renal/hepatic impairment, pregnancy, breastfeeding.
- **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors, cyclosporine, gemfibrozil.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
- **Dosage:** Adults: Atorvastatin 10-40 mg + Fenofibrate 160-200 mg daily; Pediatric: Not recommended.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests (ALT, AST, bilirubin), creatine kinase, lipid profile.


## **Popular Combinations**

-  While a fixed-dose combination exists, sometimes Atorvastatin and Fenofibrate are prescribed separately, especially if titration of individual components is necessary. The combination with ezetimibe is also possible.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess liver and renal function at baseline and periodically. Monitor for muscle symptoms. 
- **Specific Populations:**  Avoid in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Use with caution in elderly patients and those with hepatic/renal impairment.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Encourage lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise) to maximize lipid-lowering effects.  Alcohol intake should be limited due to the potential for hepatotoxicity.
