## **Usage**

This combination of ingredients, ATP, Idebenone, L-Arginine, Proanthocyanidin, Selenium, and Zinc, is not a recognized, single, FDA-approved medication. It appears to be a combination of dietary supplements often marketed for enhancing energy, improving cardiovascular health, and boosting the immune system.  Therefore, it doesn't have a specific pharmacological classification or standard medical usage as a prescribed drug.  It's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional before considering this combination, especially if you have any underlying medical conditions or are taking other medications.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination does not have an International Nonproprietary Name (INN) as it isn't an established pharmaceutical drug.  Different manufacturers may market similar formulations under various brand names. 

## **How It Works**

Given that this is a combination of individual ingredients, the mechanism of action is complex and involves the independent effects of each component:

* **ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate):** The primary energy currency of cells, crucial for various biological processes.
* **Idebenone:** A synthetic analog of Coenzyme Q10, acts as an antioxidant and may improve mitochondrial function.
* **L-Arginine:** A semi-essential amino acid involved in nitric oxide production, promoting vasodilation.
* **Proanthocyanidin:**  A type of flavonoid with antioxidant properties, may support vascular health.
* **Selenium:** An essential trace mineral with antioxidant function, contributes to immune system health.
* **Zinc:** Another essential trace mineral involved in immune function, cell growth, and wound healing.

The combination's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are not clearly defined as it hasn't undergone rigorous clinical trials as a combined entity.  Each component has its own absorption, metabolism, and elimination profiles.
