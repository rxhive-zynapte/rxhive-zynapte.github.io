## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the treatment of severe diarrhea caused by infections of the digestive tract.  It falls under the antidiarrheal and antibacterial pharmacological classifications.

## **Alternate Names**

An alternate name for this combination is Diphenoxylate/Atropine/Furazolidone. A known brand name is Lomofen.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Diphenoxylate:** A synthetic opioid agonist, acts on the smooth muscle of the intestinal tract, inhibiting excessive gastrointestinal motility and propulsion. This slows down the passage of stool through the intestines, allowing for increased water absorption and firmer stools.
* **Atropine:** An antimuscarinic agent, is present in a subtherapeutic dose to discourage the misuse of diphenoxylate, as higher doses can lead to dependence.  It works by inhibiting the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that stimulates bowel movements.
* **Furazolidone:** A nitrofuran antibacterial and antiprotozoal agent that inhibits protein synthesis, thus preventing bacterial and protozoal cell growth in the digestive tract.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Diphenoxylate:** Well-absorbed from the GI tract. Metabolized primarily in the liver to diphenoxylic acid (difenoxine), an active metabolite. Excreted mainly in feces and to a lesser extent in urine.
* **Atropine:**  Rapidly and well-absorbed from the GI tract. Distributed widely throughout the body, crossing the placenta and blood-brain barrier. Metabolized incompletely in the liver. Excreted in urine.
* **Furazolidone:** Well-absorbed after oral administration.  Metabolized primarily in the liver. Excreted mainly via renal routes.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Initial dose: 5 mg (two tablets) four times daily.
Maintenance dose:  After diarrhea is controlled, the dose can be reduced, sometimes to as low as 5 mg once daily, depending on individual need.
Maximum daily dose: 20 mg diphenoxylate/0.2 mg atropine.

#### **Children:**

* Children under 6 years: Use is not recommended.
* Children 6 to under 13 years: Use and dose must be determined by a doctor; liquid formulation only.
* Children 13 years and older: Same as adult dose.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and monitor closely due to potential age-related changes in metabolism and organ function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dose adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution due to the risk of worsening liver function. Dose adjustment may be needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with ulcerative colitis, glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, and other conditions that might be exacerbated by the anticholinergic effects of atropine.  

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication is typically not used in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be necessary based on individual response, tolerance, and the presence of renal or hepatic impairment.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, loss of appetite.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Toxic megacolon (particularly in patients with ulcerative colitis), paralytic ileus, pancreatitis, atropine toxicity (hyperthermia, tachycardia, urinary retention, flushing, dry skin and mucous membranes), severe respiratory depression, coma.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

With prolonged use, especially at higher doses, physical dependence to diphenoxylate can develop.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, urticaria, severe respiratory depression.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication
* Obstructive jaundice
* Diarrhea associated with pseudomembranous enterocolitis or other enterotoxin-producing bacteria
* Diarrhea associated with inflammatory bowel disease
* Intestinal obstruction
* Children under 6 years of age

## **Drug Interactions**

* CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioids): Increased CNS depression.
* Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g., isocarboxazid, tranylcypromine, furazolidone, selegiline): Risk of hypertensive crisis.
* Anticholinergic drugs: Enhanced anticholinergic effects.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category: C (consult a doctor before using during pregnancy). This medication may pass into breast milk and is generally not recommended during breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Diphenoxylate slows gut motility; atropine reduces secretions and discourages abuse; furazolidone combats infection.
* **Side Effects:** Common: Dry mouth, constipation, dizziness. Serious:  Toxic megacolon, respiratory depression.
* **Contraindications:** Obstructive jaundice, paralytic ileus, children <6 years.
* **Drug Interactions:** CNS depressants, MAOIs, anticholinergics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; potential fetal/neonatal risks.
* **Dosage:** Adults: Initially 5 mg four times daily, then titrated down.  Children: Not recommended under 6 years.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Fluid and electrolyte balance, bowel movements, signs of atropine toxicity.

## **Popular Combinations**

This combination itself is commonly used. However, it may be used with oral rehydration solutions to manage fluid and electrolyte loss associated with diarrhea.

## **Precautions**

Use cautiously in patients with liver or kidney disease, glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, and ulcerative colitis.
