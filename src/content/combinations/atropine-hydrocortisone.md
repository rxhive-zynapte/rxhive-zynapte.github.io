## **Usage**

Atropine and Hydrocortisone are typically not administered as a fixed combination product but can be co-administered in certain clinical settings for specific medical conditions. Atropine is primarily an anticholinergic and muscarinic antagonist, while Hydrocortisone is a glucocorticoid (corticosteroid).  The combined use often arises in emergency or critical care situations.

Atropine is used for:
- Bradycardia (slow heart rate), especially during intubation or after cardiac arrest
- Reducing secretions before anesthesia or during surgery
- Treating organophosphate poisoning

Hydrocortisone is used for:
- Adrenal insufficiency
- Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
- Inflammatory conditions
- Shock



## **Alternate Names**

**Atropine:**
- Atropine Sulfate

**Hydrocortisone:**
- Hydrocortisone Sodium Succinate (IV form)
- Hydrocortisone Sodium Phosphate (IV form)
- Cortisol


Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and formulation.

## **How It Works**

**Atropine:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Atropine competitively antagonizes acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. This action inhibits the parasympathetic nervous system, leading to increased heart rate, reduced secretions (salivary, bronchial), and bronchodilation.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Atropine is readily absorbed after intramuscular (IM), intravenous (IV), subcutaneous (SC) or oral administration. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine. It has a half-life of approximately 2-3 hours in adults and older children, while it can be longer in infants less than 2 years old.

**Hydrocortisone:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Hydrocortisone exerts its effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm, which then translocate to the nucleus and modulate gene expression. This results in diverse effects including anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and metabolic actions.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Hydrocortisone is administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM).  It is metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted in the urine with a half-life of approximately 1.5-3 hours.


## **Dosage**

Dosages for Atropine and Hydrocortisone are independent of each other and should be determined based on the specific clinical indication.  

### **Standard Dosage**  

#### **Adults: Atropine**
- Bradycardia: 0.5-1mg IV bolus, repeated every 3-5 minutes up to a total dose of 3 mg.

#### **Adults: Hydrocortisone**
- Adrenal crisis: 100 mg IV bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 100-200 mg over 24 hours.

#### **Children: Atropine**  
- Bradycardia:  0.01-0.02 mg/kg IV bolus (minimum dose: 0.1 mg, maximum single dose: 0.5 mg; maximum total dose: 1 mg in child and 2 mg in adolescents ), may repeat every 3-5 minutes.

#### **Children: Hydrocortisone**  
- Adrenal crisis: 2 mg/kg IV bolus followed by continuous infusion of 50 mg/m²/day


#### **Special Cases**  
Dosing adjustments may be necessary for both Atropine and Hydrocortisone in elderly patients and those with renal or hepatic impairment.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  
Both drugs are frequently used together during intubation, particularly rapid sequence intubation (RSI), where atropine helps prevent bradycardia and hydrocortisone aids in managing hypotension. Surgical and ICU settings may also warrant co-administration, with dosing titrated based on the individual patient needs.
