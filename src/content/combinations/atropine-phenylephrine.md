      How does Atropine + Phenylephrine work?**

      **A:** Atropine blocks muscarinic receptors, inhibiting parasympathetic
      activity and leading to pupillary dilation. Phenylephrine stimulates
      α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors, causing the iris dilator muscle to
      contract. This combination results in significant pupillary dilation.

## **Usage**

Atropine and phenylephrine are frequently used in combination, especially in ophthalmic procedures.  Atropine is primarily prescribed as an anticholinergic agent, while phenylephrine serves as a mydriatic and decongestant.  Specifically, the combination is indicated for mydriasis (pupil dilation) and cycloplegia (paralysis of ciliary muscle) during ophthalmic examinations, surgical procedures, and treatment of certain eye conditions like uveitis. Although not a labeled indication, this combination has been studied and used to prevent intraoperative miosis during cataract surgery.  Atropine is also used systemically for bradycardia, asystole, and as an antidote for organophosphate poisoning. Phenylephrine is also used systemically for hypotension. These systemic uses are not the focus of this entry, which addresses the ophthalmic use of the combination.

**Pharmacological Classification:**
* Atropine: Anticholinergic, Antimuscarinic
* Phenylephrine: α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic agonist, Mydriatic, Decongestant

**Mechanism of Action:**  Atropine competitively blocks muscarinic receptors in the eye, inhibiting the parasympathetic nervous system and thus inducing mydriasis and cycloplegia.  Phenylephrine directly stimulates α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors in the iris dilator muscle, further enhancing pupillary dilation. These agents have synergistic effects for producing mydriasis.

## **Alternate Names**

This drug combination itself does not have other names. The individual components may be referred to as follows:

* **Atropine:** Atropine Sulfate, Isopto Atropine
* **Phenylephrine:** Phenylephrine Hydrochloride, Neo-Synephrine,  Altafrin

Numerous commercial formulations may exist containing these two drugs, often with additional therapeutic agents.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Atropine exerts its effects by inhibiting the actions of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. In the eye, this leads to relaxation of the sphincter pupillae muscle (mydriasis) and paralysis of the ciliary muscle (cycloplegia). Phenylephrine activates α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors, causing contraction of the iris dilator muscle, thus contributing to mydriasis. The combined action of these medications results in significant pupillary dilation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Atropine:** After topical administration, atropine is absorbed systemically. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine. 
* **Phenylephrine:** Following ophthalmic application, phenylephrine can also be absorbed systemically although its bioavailability is quite low. It is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the liver and gastrointestinal tract, and excreted in the urine.

**Mode of Action:**
Atropine: Muscarinic receptor antagonist
Phenylephrine: α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor agonist

**Elimination:** 
* Atropine: Hepatic metabolism, Renal excretion
* Phenylephrine: Hepatic and gastrointestinal metabolism via MAO, Renal excretion


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**  
#### **Adults:**  One drop of combined solution (concentrations vary by formulation) instilled into the conjunctival sac of the affected eye(s). Dosing frequency depends on the clinical indication and can range from every 5 minutes for rapid mydriasis to once or twice daily for uveitis.

#### **Children:**   Use of 2.5% phenylephrine is recommended for pediatric patients. In patients less than one year of age, a single drop of 2.5% phenylephrine can be administered, repeated at 3-5 minute intervals as necessary, up to a maximum of three drops.  Atropine dosing should be adjusted based on the patient's age and weight. 

#### **Special Cases:**  
* **Elderly Patients** – Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the systemic effects of atropine and phenylephrine. Monitor for cardiovascular adverse events.

* **Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment** – Exercise caution and consider starting at lower doses. Monitor patients closely for adverse reactions.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions** – Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, or pyloric stenosis.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  
* **Ophthalmic Examination:** Repeated doses as needed to achieve adequate mydriasis.
* **Surgical Procedures:** Preoperative administration to facilitate surgical access.
* **Uveitis:** Regular application for its anti-inflammatory effects.
* **Intraoperative Miosis Prevention:**  Off-label use in cataract and other intraocular surgeries where maintaining pupillary dilation is crucial.

### **Dosage Adjustments**  
Adjust dosage based on patient response and the presence of any comorbidities, especially cardiovascular disease.  Close monitoring is essential in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
* **Ocular:** Blurred vision, photophobia, burning or stinging, increased intraocular pressure

* **Central Nervous System:** Hallucinations, delirium

### **Long-Term Effects**
Prolonged use of atropine can lead to chronic dry eye.


## **Contraindications**
* **Absolute:** Angle-closure glaucoma, hypersensitivity to atropine or phenylephrine.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
Safety of atropine/phenylephrine combinations during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.  Limited human data suggests potential risks. Use only if the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Atropine: Muscarinic antagonist, Phenylephrine: α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic agonist
* **Side Effects:** Blurred vision, dry mouth, photophobia, tachycardia, increased IOP, cardiovascular events (rare).
* **Contraindications:** Angle-closure glaucoma, hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:** Other anticholinergics, MAOIs, tricyclic antidepressants.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Caution advised. Insufficient data.
* **Dosage:** Varies based on indication and patient factors. Typically 1 drop instilled in affected eye(s).

## **Popular Combinations**

Atropine and phenylephrine are often used together.  They may also be combined with other ophthalmic drugs, such as tropicamide and cyclopentolate, to enhance mydriasis and cycloplegia.

## **Precautions**

Monitor for cardiovascular side effects, especially in patients with pre-existing conditions.  Use cautiously in elderly patients and patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
