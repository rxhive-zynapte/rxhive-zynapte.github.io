## **Usage**

Atropine + Tetracycline ophthalmic ointment is primarily prescribed for inflammatory eye conditions, particularly uveitis, and certain bacterial eye infections like corneal ulcers.  It combines the anticholinergic and mydriatic effects of atropine with the broad-spectrum antibiotic action of tetracycline. It falls under the pharmacological classifications of anticholinergic, mydriatic, cycloplegic, and antibiotic.

Atropine works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, on muscarinic receptors in the eye, leading to pupil dilation (mydriasis) and paralysis of the ciliary muscle (cycloplegia). This reduces pain and inflammation. Tetracycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, combating bacterial infection.


## **Alternate Names**

This combination is often referred to as Atropine and Tetracycline ophthalmic ointment. Brand names include Atrocin Eye Ointment.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Atropine exerts its effect by competitively antagonizing acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors in the eye, causing mydriasis and cycloplegia. Tetracycline binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit in bacteria, preventing the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex, thus inhibiting protein synthesis and bacterial growth.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Atropine is readily absorbed through the cornea.  Systemic absorption can occur, especially in children, with potential for systemic anticholinergic side effects. Tetracycline is absorbed to a lesser extent.  Both drugs are metabolized in the liver and eliminated primarily through renal excretion.

**Mode of Action:** Atropine acts as a competitive antagonist at muscarinic receptors. Tetracycline's mode of action involves inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Atropine binds to muscarinic receptors. Tetracycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit.

**Elimination Pathways:** Both Atropine and Tetracycline undergo hepatic metabolism and are eliminated primarily via renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  A small amount of ointment is applied to the affected eye(s) three times daily.

#### **Children:** Use in children under 8 years old is generally not recommended due to the risk of tetracycline staining developing teeth. If used, limit the duration of treatment.  For children older than 8, a small amount applied to the affected eye(s) three times daily or as directed by the physician.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** Elderly patients may be more susceptible to the systemic side effects of atropine, particularly mental confusion. Careful monitoring is necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** While dose adjustments are not usually needed in renal impairment, caution should be exercised.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dose adjustment might be necessary in severe liver disease.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular conditions, prostatic hypertrophy, or urinary retention.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This topical combination is mainly used for uveitis and corneal ulcers. Its use in other clinical settings like intubation, surgery, or ICU is not relevant as it's an ophthalmic preparation.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:** Blurred vision, dry mouth, dilated pupils, photosensitivity, eye irritation.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:** Allergic reactions, increased intraocular pressure, systemic anticholinergic effects (e.g., tachycardia, confusion, hallucinations).


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to atropine or tetracycline. Angle-closure glaucoma. Infants and young children. Use with caution in patients with prostatic hypertrophy, urinary retention, or cardiovascular disease.


## **Drug Interactions**

Other anticholinergics can potentiate atropine's effects. Avoid concomitant use of other ophthalmic medications unless advised by a physician.  For oral tetracyclines, antacids, iron supplements, and dairy products can reduce absorption.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Avoid use during pregnancy, especially during the second and third trimesters. Small amounts of atropine and tetracycline may be present in breast milk. Exercise caution during breastfeeding. Short-term ophthalmic use is generally considered safe, but avoid prolonged or repeated courses.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Atropine: Anticholinergic, mydriatic, cycloplegic. Tetracycline: Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis.
- **Side Effects:** Blurred vision, dry mouth, dilated pupils, photosensitivity, eye irritation. Rarely: Allergic reaction, increased intraocular pressure, systemic anticholinergic effects.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, angle-closure glaucoma, infants and young children.  Caution in patients with prostatic hypertrophy, urinary retention, cardiovascular disease.
- **Drug Interactions:** Other anticholinergics, antacids, iron supplements, dairy products (with oral tetracyclines).
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid use during pregnancy. Use caution during breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** Adults and children: Apply a small amount to affected eye(s) three times daily.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Intraocular pressure, pupil size.


## **Popular Combinations**

This combination is not typically combined with other drugs in the ophthalmic form.


## **Precautions**

Monitor intraocular pressure in at-risk patients. Evaluate for any history of hypersensitivity. Use cautiously in patients with cardiac conditions, prostatic hypertrophy, or urinary retention. Patients should avoid driving or operating machinery if blurred vision occurs.
