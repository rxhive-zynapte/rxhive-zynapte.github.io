## **Usage**

Avibactam + Ceftazidime is prescribed for the treatment of various bacterial infections caused by susceptible Gram-negative bacteria.  It is particularly useful against complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI), complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) including pyelonephritis, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).  It's also employed for infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms in patients with limited treatment options where other antibiotics have failed or are unsuitable.  Its pharmacological classification is "antibiotic," specifically a combination of a beta-lactam antibiotic (ceftazidime) and a beta-lactamase inhibitor (avibactam). Ceftazidime exerts its antibacterial action by binding to and inhibiting penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), crucial enzymes involved in bacterial cell wall synthesis. Avibactam protects ceftazidime from degradation by certain beta-lactamases produced by bacteria, thereby expanding ceftazidime's effectiveness against resistant strains.

## **Alternate Names**

A common alternate name is Ceftazidime/Avibactam. Popular brand names include Avycaz and Zavicefta.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ceftazidime inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), leading to bacterial cell death. Avibactam inhibits a broad range of beta-lactamases, including Ambler classes A, C, and some D enzymes. It restores ceftazidime's activity against bacteria that would otherwise be resistant. 

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Administered intravenously, achieving rapid and complete systemic availability.
* **Metabolism:** Ceftazidime undergoes minimal metabolism. Avibactam is also minimally metabolized.
* **Elimination:** Both drugs are primarily eliminated via renal excretion, necessitating dose adjustments in patients with renal impairment.

**Mode of Action:** Ceftazidime primarily targets PBP3 in  Gram-negative bacteria.  Avibactam forms a covalent adduct with the active site serine residue of beta-lactamases, preventing their hydrolytic activity against ceftazidime.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

2.5 g (ceftazidime 2 g + avibactam 0.5 g) IV every 8 hours, infused over 120 minutes for Avycaz or 2 hours for Zavicefta.

#### **Children (3 months to <18 years):**

Dosing depends on age, weight, and renal function.

* **CrCl > 50 mL/min/1.73 m²:**
    * 3 months to <6 months: 40 mg/kg ceftazidime + 10 mg/kg avibactam IV every 8 hours, infused over 2 hours.
    * 6 months to <18 years: 50 mg/kg ceftazidime + 12.5 mg/kg avibactam IV every 8 hours, infused over 2 hours (maximum dose 2g/0.5g).


* **CrCl ≤ 50 mL/min/1.73 m²:**  Dosage adjustment required.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment required unless renal impairment is present.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are required based on CrCl.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is advisable, especially in patients with seizures or neurological conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations remain consistent across various clinical settings, including intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations. Adjust dose based on renal function.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage modifications based on renal impairment are needed.  Refer to specific brand labeling for detailed dose reduction guidelines based on CrCl or eGFR.  

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Rash
* Elevated liver enzymes
* Injection site reactions

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea
* Seizures (especially in patients with renal impairment)
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term effects are rarely reported. 

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs include severe allergic reactions, *Clostridium difficile* infection, and seizures.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to ceftazidime, avibactam, or other cephalosporins.

## **Drug Interactions**

* Probenecid may decrease renal clearance of ceftazidime.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Ceftazidime/avibactam should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Limited data are available regarding the use of this medication during breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Ceftazidime: PBP inhibition; Avibactam: beta-lactamase inhibition.
* **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, rash, *C. difficile* infection, seizures.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to ceftazidime, avibactam, or other cephalosporins.
* **Drug Interactions:** Probenecid.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Caution advised; potential benefits must outweigh risks.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 2.5 g IV q8h; Children: dose based on age, weight, and renal function.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function (CrCl or eGFR), signs of hypersensitivity,  signs of superinfection (e.g., *C. difficile* infection), neurological status.

## **Popular Combinations**

Metronidazole is frequently combined with Avibactam/Ceftazidime for cIAI.  Other antibacterials active against Gram-positive pathogens may be added when such infections are suspected or confirmed.

## **Precautions**

Monitor renal function, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal impairment.  Assess for history of allergies to beta-lactams. Observe for signs and symptoms of *C. difficile* infection. In patients with a history of seizures, monitor for neurological adverse events.
