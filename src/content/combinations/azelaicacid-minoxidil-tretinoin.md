## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for **androgenetic alopecia**, also known as male or female pattern baldness. It may also be used for other types of hair loss, like telogen effluvium and traction alopecia, although its efficacy in these conditions is less established.
- **Pharmacological classification:** This is a combination product containing a **vasodilator (minoxidil), a retinoid (tretinoin), and a dicarboxylic acid (azelaic acid)** with anti-inflammatory and 5-alpha-reductase inhibiting properties.  It is classified as a hair growth promoter and scalp health improver.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Azelaic acid inhibits 5-alpha-reductase, the enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone implicated in hair follicle miniaturization. Minoxidil is a vasodilator, increasing blood flow to hair follicles, delivering more oxygen and nutrients. Tretinoin, a retinoid, increases cell turnover and promotes hair follicle growth.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination.  It is often referred to simply as a "minoxidil, tretinoin, and azelaic acid combination" or topical solution.
- **Brand names:** Minokem-N. More brand names may exist regionally.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  The combined action of the three components targets different aspects of hair loss. Azelaic acid reduces DHT levels, which helps to prevent further miniaturization of hair follicles. Minoxidil enhances blood supply to the follicles promoting hair growth. Tretinoin enhances follicular growth and keratinization.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Azelaic acid has low percutaneous absorption (1.6% - 3.9%). Absorption may increase with inflammation. Limited data is available on the percutaneous absorption of minoxidil and tretinoin in this combination. Elimination pathways are primarily renal and hepatic. Minoxidil is mainly eliminated via the kidneys, and tretinoin via hepatic metabolism. Data on azelaic acid elimination in combination preparations is limited. 
- **Mode of Action:** Azelaic acid acts by inhibiting 5-alpha-reductase.  Minoxidil's mechanism is not fully understood but is thought to involve potassium channel opening, leading to vasodilation. Tretinoin activates retinoic acid receptors, modulating gene expression and influencing cell growth and differentiation.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition:**  Azelaic acid inhibits 5-alpha-reductase. Minoxidil interacts with potassium channels. Tretinoin binds to retinoic acid receptors.

## **Dosage**

As this is a compounded medication, dosing varies significantly. Here is the dosage mentioned in one of the sources.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Not classified. Topical tretinoin is typically advised against due to potential risk although limited data is available. Azelaic Acid is considered relatively safe to use topically during pregnancy. Minoxidil is typically advised against during pregnancy. The combination should generally be avoided unless specifically directed by a physician.
- Data regarding excretion in breast milk is limited for each of the individual medications. Azelaic Acid and Minoxidil are thought to be present in low amounts in breast milk; avoidance is generally advised for this combination.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Azelaic acid inhibits 5-alpha-reductase, minoxidil vasodilates, and tretinoin promotes cell turnover.
- **Side Effects:** Scalp irritation, dryness, headache, unwanted hair growth.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, scalp lesions, pregnancy, breastfeeding, children under 18.
- **Drug Interactions:**  Other topical treatments, antihypertensives, medications interacting with alcohol.
