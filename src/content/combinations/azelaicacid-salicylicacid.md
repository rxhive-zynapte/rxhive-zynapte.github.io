      What are the differences between azelaic acid and salicylic acid?**


      **A:**  Azelaic acid has anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and
      anti-keratinizing properties and is effective for acne, rosacea, and
      hyperpigmentation. Salicylic acid primarily works as a keratolytic agent,
      exfoliating dead skin cells and unclogging pores to treat acne.

## **Usage**

- Azelaic acid and salicylic acid are prescribed for the topical treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris and the inflammatory papules and pustules of mild to moderate rosacea.  Azelaic acid can also be used to treat hyperpigmentation, such as melasma. Salicylic acid also has keratolytic activity, meaning it helps to break down the outer layer of skin which can help with skin conditions such as psoriasis and warts.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Both are classified as keratolytic agents. Azelaic acid is a dicarboxylic acid, and salicylic acid is a beta-hydroxy acid (BHA).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Azelaic acid works through multiple mechanisms, including antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anti-keratinizing properties. It inhibits the growth of *Propionibacterium acnes*, a bacteria implicated in acne, and reduces inflammation. It also normalizes the process of keratinization, preventing clogged pores. Salicylic acid is a keratolytic agent, meaning it breaks down the bonds between skin cells. It helps to exfoliate dead skin cells and unclog pores, which can help to prevent and treat acne. It also has anti-inflammatory properties.


## **Alternate Names**

- **Azelaic Acid:**  Nonanedioic acid
- **Salicylic Acid:** 2-Hydroxybenzoic acid
- **Brand Names:**  There are many brand names for products containing azelaic acid and salicylic acid, and their availability can vary by region. It is best to consult with a pharmacist or dermatologist for available brands in India.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Azelaic acid reduces inflammation and inhibits the growth of *P. acnes* bacteria, while also normalizing keratinization. Salicylic acid works by breaking down the bonds between skin cells and promoting exfoliation, it also has anti-inflammatory properties.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Azelaic acid, when applied topically, is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation. Salicylic acid also has low systemic absorption when applied topically.
- **Mode of Action:** Azelaic acid inhibits the thioredoxin reductase enzyme in the mitochondria of keratinocytes and melanocytes, and it also has antimicrobial effects and inhibits neutrophil and mast cell activity. Salicylic acid keratolytic activity is the result of the breakdown of hydrogen bonds between corneocytes and intercellular lipids.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Most azelaic acid is eliminated from the body unchanged in the urine. Salicylic acid is metabolized by the liver and eliminated in the urine.


## **Dosage**
