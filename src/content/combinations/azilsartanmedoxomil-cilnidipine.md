      How does this combination lower blood pressure?**

      **A:** Azilsartan blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that
      narrows blood vessels, while cilnidipine blocks calcium channels in blood
      vessel walls and the heart, both leading to vasodilation and reduced blood
      pressure.

## **Usage**

- Azilsartan medoxomil + Cilnidipine is prescribed for the treatment of **hypertension (high blood pressure)**.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antihypertensive (combination of an Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB) and a Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB)).
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination therapy works by two distinct mechanisms:
    - **Azilsartan medoxomil:**  Blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that causes blood vessels to narrow. This blockade leads to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), reducing blood pressure.
    - **Cilnidipine:** Inhibits the entry of calcium into the smooth muscle cells of blood vessels and the heart, causing vasodilation and reducing cardiac workload, thus lowering blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination.
- **Brand Names:**  Myotan CN, Zilarbi CN.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Azilsartan medoxomil, after being metabolized to azilsartan, selectively blocks angiotensin II receptors (AT1 receptors) in vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Cilnidipine blocks calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle and the heart. The combined effect is a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and cardiac workload, leading to a decrease in blood pressure.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Azilsartan medoxomil:** It is a prodrug rapidly hydrolyzed to its active metabolite, azilsartan, during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.
    - **Cilnidipine:** Well absorbed orally. Cilnidipine is highly lipophilic and occupies the binding site avidly.
- **Mode of Action:**
    - **Receptor Binding:** Azilsartan competitively binds to and blocks AT1 receptors.
    - **Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation**: Cilnidipine blocks calcium influx into cells by inhibiting L-type and N-type calcium channels, leading to smooth muscle relaxation.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism for both drugs, followed by renal and biliary excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: 40 mg azilsartan medoxomil / 5 mg cilnidipine once daily.
- Maintenance dose:  May be increased to 40 mg azilsartan medoxomil / 10 mg cilnidipine after 2-4 weeks if needed.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for pediatric use. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Start with a lower dose and titrate cautiously based on response and tolerability.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment might be needed depending upon severity.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction is advised in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use cautiously in patients with diabetes, congestive heart failure, or renal artery stenosis.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Not indicated for specific clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It is intended for chronic hypertension management.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose modifications should be made based on patient-specific factors, including renal function, hepatic function, and other comorbid conditions.

- Potassium-sparing diuretics (may increase potassium levels).
- Lithium (increased lithium levels).
- Alcohol (may enhance hypotensive effects).
- Grapefruit juice (may increase cilnidipine levels).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
