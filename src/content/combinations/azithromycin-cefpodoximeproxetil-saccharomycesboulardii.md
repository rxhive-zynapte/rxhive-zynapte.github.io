## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for various bacterial infections, including respiratory tract infections (sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia), skin and soft tissue infections, urinary tract infections, and acute otitis media (middle ear infection).  Saccharomyces boulardii is included to prevent or treat antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Azithromycin: Macrolide antibiotic
* Cefpodoxime Proxetil: Cephalosporin antibiotic
* Saccharomyces boulardii: Probiotic yeast

**Mechanism of Action:**

* Azithromycin: Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit.
* Cefpodoxime: Interferes with bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins.
* Saccharomyces boulardii:  Restores the balance of gut flora, which can be disrupted by antibiotic use.


## **Alternate Names**
* Cafage-AZ Tablet


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* Azithromycin: Bacteriostatic (inhibits bacterial growth) at lower concentrations; bactericidal (kills bacteria) at higher concentrations for some susceptible bacteria.
* Cefpodoxime: Bactericidal against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
* Saccharomyces boulardii:  Produces metabolites that inhibit the growth of certain pathogenic bacteria and yeasts, such as *Clostridium difficile*. It also enhances intestinal barrier function and modulates immune responses.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* Azithromycin: Well-absorbed orally, long half-life (68 hours), distributes widely into tissues. Metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in bile.
* Cefpodoxime Proxetil: Converted to the active cefpodoxime after absorption.  Excreted primarily by the kidneys.
* Saccharomyces boulardii: Not absorbed systemically; acts locally in the gut and is eliminated in the stool.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  One tablet twice daily for 5-7 days. The exact dose and duration depend on the specific infection being treated.


#### **Children:**  Pediatric dosage is based on the child's weight and the specific infection. Consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosing guidelines and safety considerations.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Dose adjustments may be necessary due to age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose modifications are necessary depending on the degree of impairment (creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate).
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction may be necessary for patients with moderate to severe liver disease, especially for azithromycin.  Cefpodoxime dosage adjustments are not typically necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases** 

This combination is generally not specifically indicated for use in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Dosages for acute infections are as listed above.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Stomach pain
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Indigestion
* Loss of appetite
* Flatulence

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema)
* *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea (pseudomembranous colitis)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage), especially with azithromycin
* QT interval prolongation (a heart rhythm problem) with azithromycin


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to azithromycin, cefpodoxime, other macrolides, cephalosporins, or any component of the formulation.
* History of cholestatic jaundice or hepatic dysfunction associated with prior azithromycin use.



## **Drug Interactions**

* Antacids (containing aluminum or magnesium): Can reduce the absorption of both azithromycin and cefpodoxime. Take antacids at least 2 hours before or after these antibiotics.
* Warfarin and other anticoagulants: Azithromycin can increase the effects of warfarin, leading to an increased risk of bleeding. Monitor the international normalized ratio (INR) closely.
* Digoxin: Azithromycin can increase digoxin levels. Monitor digoxin levels.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Azithromycin is generally considered safe during pregnancy. Cefpodoxime's safety profile during pregnancy is less well-established. Consult a physician before use during pregnancy.  It is advisable to use only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.

For breastfeeding, both medications are excreted in breast milk in small amounts. Azithromycin is considered compatible with breastfeeding, but cefpodoxime should be used with caution.  Monitor the infant for any adverse effects.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Azithromycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. Cefpodoxime inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis. Saccharomyces boulardii restores gut flora.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, headache, dizziness; rarely, severe allergic reactions, *C. difficile* infection.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity; history of cholestatic jaundice/hepatic dysfunction with azithromycin.
* **Drug Interactions:** Antacids, warfarin, digoxin.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult a physician before use.
* **Dosage:** Adults: Typically, one tablet twice daily for 5-7 days. Pediatric and special populations: Dosage adjustments needed.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests, renal function tests, complete blood count (CBC), electrolyte levels.



## **Popular Combinations**

This specific combination is not commonly used with other drugs.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Evaluate for allergies, assess liver and kidney function before administration.
* **Pregnant Women:** Consult a physician before use.
* **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Consult a physician before use. Monitor the infant for side effects.
