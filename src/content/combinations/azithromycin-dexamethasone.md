## **Usage**

Azithromycin + Dexamethasone is primarily indicated for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis and blepharoconjunctivitis.  It combines an antibiotic (azithromycin) with an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid (dexamethasone).

## **Alternate Names**

AzaSite Plus (brand name). There might be other brand names depending on the region and manufacturers.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Azithromycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit, thus preventing bacterial growth. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, exerts its anti-inflammatory action by suppressing the migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and reversing increased capillary permeability.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Azithromycin:** Administered as eye drops, achieves high concentrations in the ocular tissues. Systemically, azithromycin is well absorbed, widely distributed, and metabolised in the liver, with primarily biliary excretion.
*   **Dexamethasone:** Absorbed from the eye, achieving therapeutic levels in ocular tissues. Systemically, dexamethasone is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 in the liver, with renal excretion of metabolites.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**  
#### **Adults:**  Instill one drop into the affected eye(s) twice daily for 14 days.
#### **Children:**  Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established conclusively. Use only if deemed necessary by a healthcare professional, with careful monitoring.
