## **Usage**

- Azithromycin + Levofloxacin is prescribed for the treatment of various bacterial infections, including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS), acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (ABECB), uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections (in combination with metronidazole), and complicated urinary tract infections, including pyelonephritis.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Macrolide antibiotic (Azithromycin) and Fluoroquinolone antibiotic (Levofloxacin).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Azithromycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit, thereby suppressing bacterial growth. Levofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair. The combination results in a synergistic bactericidal effect.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this combination.
- **Brand Names:** This combination is usually available as generics.  Brand names may vary depending on the region and manufacturer.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Azithromycin exerts its effect by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. Levofloxacin disrupts bacterial DNA replication and repair, leading to bacterial cell death.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Azithromycin:** Well absorbed orally, high tissue penetration, long half-life (68 hours), hepatic metabolism, primarily biliary excretion.
    - **Levofloxacin:** Well absorbed orally, renal excretion (primarily unchanged), some hepatic metabolism.
- **Mode of Action:**  Azithromycin binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit of bacteria, inhibiting protein synthesis. Levofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Azithromycin binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit. Levofloxacin inhibits DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Azithromycin is mainly excreted in bile. Levofloxacin is primarily renally excreted.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Specific dosing regimens vary based on the infection being treated.  A common dose is Azithromycin 500mg once daily and Levofloxacin 500-750mg once daily. Dosages and treatment duration should be based on the patient's condition and the causative pathogen.

#### **Children:**

- This combination is generally not recommended for children due to limited safety and efficacy data.  Consult a pediatrician for alternative treatments.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary in cases of renal or hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Levofloxacin dosage adjustments are necessary based on creatinine clearance. Azithromycin adjustments are typically not required except in severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Azithromycin dosage adjustment may be needed in severe liver disease. Levofloxacin adjustment is generally not required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution should be exercised in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, myasthenia gravis, or a history of seizures. Electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) should be corrected before starting treatment.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Dosage in clinical use cases should follow standard treatment guidelines for the specific infection and patient population. Close monitoring for adverse effects is recommended.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments should be made based on renal function, hepatic function, and potential drug interactions.  Consult specialist resources and dosing guidelines.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, insomnia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Tendonitis, tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, hepatotoxicity, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), seizures, psychosis.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Prolonged use can lead to an increased risk of tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, and antibiotic resistance.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, anaphylaxis, severe hepatotoxicity, C. difficile-associated diarrhea, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to macrolides or fluoroquinolones, history of QT prolongation or torsades de pointes, myasthenia gravis, concurrent use of other QT prolonging drugs.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Antacids, sucralfate, metal cations (iron, magnesium, calcium), warfarin, theophylline, digoxin, certain antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, sotalol), certain antidepressants (tricyclics), NSAIDs, cyclosporine, tacrolimus. Alcohol should be avoided due to a potential increase in side effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Azithromycin is generally considered safe during pregnancy.  Levofloxacin should be avoided during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk.
- Both drugs can be excreted in breast milk and have potential adverse effects on infants.  Breastfeeding is generally not recommended while taking these medications.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Azithromycin: Inhibits protein synthesis. Levofloxacin: Inhibits DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, QT prolongation, tendon rupture.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, myasthenia gravis, QT prolongation risk.
- **Drug Interactions:** Antacids, metal cations, warfarin, theophylline.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Azithromycin generally safe; levofloxacin avoid.
- **Dosage:** Varies depending on infection; adjust for renal/hepatic impairment.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  ECG (for QT prolongation), liver function tests, renal function tests, signs of tendonitis.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Levofloxacin is sometimes combined with metronidazole for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess for allergies, renal/hepatic function, and potential drug interactions before initiating therapy.
- **Specific Populations:** Avoid in children and during pregnancy (levofloxacin); caution in breastfeeding mothers.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid alcohol.
