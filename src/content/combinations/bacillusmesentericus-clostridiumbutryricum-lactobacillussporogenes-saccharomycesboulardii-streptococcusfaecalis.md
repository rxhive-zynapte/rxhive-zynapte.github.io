## **Usage**

This combination of probiotics is prescribed for various gastrointestinal disorders, including:

* Antibiotic-associated diarrhea
* Infectious diarrhea
* Gastroenteritis
* Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
* Constipation
* *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea
* *Helicobacter pylori* infection (as an adjunct to eradication therapy)
* Traveler's diarrhea
* Diarrhea in pregnant women
* Lactose intolerance
* Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)


It is also sometimes used for allergic disorders, obesity, common cold, eczema, inflammatory arthritis, vaginal yeast infections, and urinary tract infections although robust evidence might be lacking for these conditions.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Probiotic

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination product works by restoring and maintaining the balance of gut flora. Each component contributes in specific ways:

* *Bacillus mesentericus*: Inhibits the growth of pathogenic bacteria and aids digestion.
* *Clostridium butyricum*: Produces butyric acid, a crucial nutrient for gut lining, promoting beneficial bacteria growth, and interferes with the growth of pathogens like *C. difficile*.
* *Lactobacillus sporogenes*: Improves gastrointestinal ecology by maintaining microflora balance and may incorporate cholesterol into the cell wall improving lipid levels.
* *Saccharomyces boulardii*: A non-pathogenic yeast that helps restore gut flora, particularly useful in antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
* *Streptococcus faecalis*: Helps clear diarrhea, stimulates the immune system, balances intestinal microflora, and may reduce lactose intolerance symptoms.


## **Alternate Names**

Some alternate names and brand names for this combination include:

* Bio-Three
* Next Gut Capsule
* Bactolac
* Gutgermina


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The combined effect of these probiotics helps to restore a healthy gut microbiota, supporting normal digestive function and boosting local immunity. Butyric acid produced by *C. butyricum* is essential for the health of the intestinal epithelium.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** These probiotics are primarily active within the gastrointestinal tract and have minimal systemic absorption.
* **Metabolism:** The probiotics themselves are metabolized within the gut, with some strains producing beneficial byproducts like butyric acid and lactic acid.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through feces.



**Mode of Action:** Each strain works through different mechanisms, including competitive exclusion of pathogens, production of antimicrobial substances, and modulation of the immune system.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** While specific interactions are not fully elucidated,  the probiotics may interact with gut receptors, impacting inflammatory pathways. Butyric acid produced can modulate gene expression affecting gut health.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  The typical adult dosage can range up to 9 capsules/tablets per day or as directed by a healthcare professional. The specific dosage depends on the product's formulation and the individual's condition.

#### **Special Cases:**
* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dosage modifications should be considered based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary due to altered metabolism.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments may be needed depending on the specific comorbid condition.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Currently, specific dosage recommendations for clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations are not explicitly defined. Clinical experience and patient status should guide any dosage modifications in such scenarios.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage modifications should be individualized and tailored to the patient's specific circumstances.  Factors to consider include renal or hepatic impairment, metabolic disorders, and other medications being taken.
