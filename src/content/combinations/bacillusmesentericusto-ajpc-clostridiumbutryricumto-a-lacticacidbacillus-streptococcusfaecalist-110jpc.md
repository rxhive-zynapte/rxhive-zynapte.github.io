## **Usage**

This combination of probiotics is primarily prescribed for managing various gastrointestinal disorders, including:

*   Dysbacteriosis (imbalance of gut flora)
*   Antibiotic-associated diarrhea
*   Infectious diarrhea
*   Gastroenteritis
*   Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
*   Constipation
*   *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea
*   *Helicobacter pylori* infection
*   Traveler's diarrhea
*   Diarrhea in pregnant women
*   Lactose intolerance

It may also be used for conditions like allergic disorders, obesity, common cold, eczema, inflammatory arthritis, vaginal yeast infections, and urinary tract infections, although more research is needed for these uses.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Probiotic

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination product works by restoring and maintaining the balance of beneficial bacteria in the gut. Each component contributes in specific ways:

*   *Bacillus mesentericus* inhibits the growth of some harmful bacteria.
*   *Clostridium butyricum* produces butyric acid, an important energy source for the cells lining the gut.
*   *Lactic acid bacillus* produces lactic acid, which helps maintain a healthy pH balance in the gut.
*   *Streptococcus faecalis T-110 JPC* assists in breaking down carbohydrates and also produces lactic acid.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for this specific combination product. Individual components may be referred to by other names (e.g., *Enterococcus faecalis* for *Streptococcus faecalis*).

**Brand Names:** Several brand names exist for this combination, including Cronogut, Synerbact, Bifilac, Azbiotic, Grinedgut, and others depending on the manufacturer and region.



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The combined action of the four probiotics helps restore a healthy gut microbiome, which positively influences various physiological processes. It can reduce inflammation in the gut, improve nutrient absorption, and enhance immune function.  Butyric acid produced by *C. butyricum* is crucial for gut health, acting as an energy source for colonocytes and promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria.

**Pharmacokinetics:** These probiotics primarily exert their effects within the gastrointestinal tract. *Bacillus mesentericus* spores are resistant to stomach acid, allowing them to reach the intestines. Information on the specific pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) of each component is limited. As live microorganisms, they colonize the gut, reproduce, and their metabolic byproducts contribute to the overall effects. Elimination mostly occurs through the feces.

**Mode of Action:** The probiotics in this combination modulate the gut flora by competing with pathogenic bacteria for resources and adhesion sites, thereby limiting the growth of harmful microorganisms. The production of lactic acid and butyric acid creates an unfavorable environment for the growth of certain pathogenic bacteria.  The probiotic bacteria also enhance immune function by stimulating the activity of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).
