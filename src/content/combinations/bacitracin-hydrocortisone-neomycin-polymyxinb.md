## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the treatment of superficial bacterial infections of the skin and the reduction of associated inflammation (swelling, redness, itching). It is effective against a range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Bacitracin and Polymyxin B: Polypeptide antibiotics
* Neomycin: Aminoglycoside antibiotic
* Hydrocortisone: Corticosteroid

**Mechanism of Action:**

* Bacitracin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis.
* Polymyxin B disrupts the bacterial cell membrane.
* Neomycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis.
* Hydrocortisone provides anti-inflammatory and antipruritic effects.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination drug is often referred to by its components. Brand names include Cortisporin, Neo-Polycin HC, Neotricin HC, Ocu-Cort and AK-Spore HC.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* The antibiotics act synergistically to kill bacteria by targeting different aspects of bacterial structure and function.
* Hydrocortisone, through binding to glucocorticoid receptors, reduces inflammation by suppressing the immune response, decreasing vasodilation and capillary permeability, and inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* Topical application results in minimal systemic absorption.
* When absorbed systematically, components are metabolized primarily by the liver (hydrocortisone) and excreted by the kidneys (neomycin and hydrocortisone).  Bacitracin is eliminated by a combination of renal and non-renal mechanisms. Polymyxin B is eliminated by renal mechanisms.

**Mode of Action:**

* Bacitracin blocks dephosphorylation of the lipid carrier molecule responsible for transporting peptidoglycans for cell wall synthesis.
* Polymyxin B binds to phospholipids in the bacterial cell membrane, increasing its permeability.
* Neomycin binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit, disrupting protein synthesis.
* Hydrocortisone binds to glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm, translocates to the nucleus, and modulates gene expression related to inflammation.

**Elimination Pathways:**

* Renal excretion (neomycin, hydrocortisone, polymyxin B).
* Hepatic metabolism (hydrocortisone).
* Other non-renal mechanisms (bacitracin).


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

A thin layer of ointment or cream should be applied to the affected area 2-4 times daily.

#### **Children:**

Similar dosing as adults, but use should be limited to smaller surface areas. Pediatric safety considerations include increased risk of systemic absorption and adrenal suppression with prolonged use.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustment is typically required, but monitor for systemic side effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution due to potential neomycin and polymyxin B toxicity.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Monitor patients for increased systemic effects of hydrocortisone.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with diabetes, as hydrocortisone can affect blood glucose levels.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination drug is typically not used in these clinical settings. It is primarily indicated for topical treatment of superficial skin infections. 


### **Dosage Adjustments**

No standard dosage adjustments are provided in manufacturer labeling.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Local irritation (burning, itching, stinging).
* Dryness.
* Redness.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Allergic contact dermatitis.
* Skin atrophy.
* Secondary infection.
* Ototoxicity (if used in or near the ear).
* Nephrotoxicity (with systemic absorption).


### **Long-Term Effects**

* Skin thinning.
* Telangiectasia.
* Hypopigmentation.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any of the components.
* Viral skin infections (herpes simplex, varicella zoster).
* Fungal skin infections.
* Extensive burns or damaged skin.


## **Drug Interactions**

* Other topical medications applied to the same area.
* Systemic aminoglycosides (increased risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity).
* Neuromuscular blocking agents (potentiated effects).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (topical); Not formally assigned to a category.
* Fetal risks include potential teratogenicity from hydrocortisone, particularly with high concentrations or prolonged exposure.
* Limited information on drug excretion in breast milk. Exercise caution and wipe off any medication prior to breastfeeding if applied to the breast area.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Combined antibiotic and anti-inflammatory action.
* **Side Effects:** Local irritation, allergic reactions, skin atrophy (long-term use).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, viral/fungal infections, extensive burns.
* **Drug Interactions:** Other topical agents, systemic aminoglycosides, neuromuscular blocking agents.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
* **Dosage:** Apply thin layer to affected area 2-4 times daily.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Observe the affected area for signs of healing or adverse reactions.


## **Popular Combinations**

This medication is typically used as a stand-alone topical treatment. 


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Avoid contact with eyes, mucous membranes, and open wounds.
* **Specific Populations:** Use with caution in pregnant/breastfeeding women and children.
