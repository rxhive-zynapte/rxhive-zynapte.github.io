## **Usage**

Bacitracin + Neomycin + Polymyxin B is a combination antibiotic used topically for the prevention and treatment of superficial bacterial infections of the skin and the eye.  It is prescribed for conditions such as:

* **Skin:** Minor cuts, scrapes, burns, and abrasions.
* **Eye:** Bacterial conjunctivitis, blepharitis, keratitis, keratoconjunctivitis, and blepharoconjunctivitis.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Antibiotic (Ophthalmic and Topical)

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination product works by inhibiting bacterial growth through multiple mechanisms:

* **Bacitracin:** Interferes with bacterial cell wall synthesis.
* **Neomycin:** Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis.
* **Polymyxin B:** Disrupts the bacterial cell membrane permeability.


## **Alternate Names**

* **Generic:** Bacitracin/Neomycin/Polymyxin B
* **Ophthalmic:**  Bacitracin/Neomycin/Polymyxin B Sulfate
* **Brand Names:**  Neosporin, Neo-Polycin, Triple Antibiotic Ointment, AK-Spore, Neosporin Ophthalmic,  Ocu-Spore-B


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  The combination of bacitracin, neomycin, and polymyxin B provides broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against a range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria commonly implicated in skin and eye infections.  Their combined effect is synergistic, enhancing overall efficacy.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Topical application results in minimal systemic absorption when used on intact skin. Absorption may increase with application to large open wounds or damaged skin.  Ophthalmic administration also leads to limited systemic absorption.
* **Metabolism:** Limited data available on metabolism of these antibiotics when used topically or ophthalmically.
* **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion for neomycin.  Bacitracin and polymyxin B are eliminated through renal and non-renal routes.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Topical:** Apply a thin layer to the affected skin area 1-3 times daily.
* **Ophthalmic:** Apply a small amount of ointment into the affected eye(s) every 3-4 hours for 7-10 days.


#### **Children:**

* **Topical:** Similar to adult dosing, but under the guidance of a pediatrician.
* **Ophthalmic:** Consult a pediatrician for dosage and duration.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dose adjustments are typically needed. Monitor for signs of nephrotoxicity with prolonged use.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with renal dysfunction due to potential for neomycin accumulation.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient factors.  



## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects:**

* **Topical:** Itching, burning, rash, redness, or irritation at the application site.
* **Ophthalmic:**  Temporary blurred vision, burning, stinging, itching, redness of the eye or eyelid, increased watering.




### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* **Topical/Ophthalmic:** Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling), signs of ototoxicity (hearing loss, tinnitus) or nephrotoxicity (changes in urine output).


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Prolonged use may lead to the development of resistant organisms, including fungal superinfections.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to bacitracin, neomycin, or polymyxin B.
* Perforated tympanic membrane (ear drum) when used in the ear.
* Large open wounds or severe burns (topical).



## **Drug Interactions**

* **Topical:** Other topical medications, especially those containing neomycin or other aminoglycosides, should be used with caution due to the risk of additive toxicity.
* **Ophthalmic:** Limited systemic absorption minimizes the risk of significant drug interactions.
* **Neuromuscular blocking agents and aminoglycosides (systemic):**  Concurrent use with systemic aminoglycosides (like neomycin) may enhance neuromuscular blockade.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** No adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Use only if clearly needed and under the guidance of a physician. FDA category C. (Older classification).
* **Breastfeeding:** Caution is recommended due to potential excretion in breast milk. Consider the risks and benefits.  Bacitracin and polymyxin B have low risk, while neomycin levels in breast milk are expected to be low with ophthalmic use.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Combination antibiotic that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis (bacitracin), protein synthesis (neomycin), and disrupts cell membrane permeability (polymyxin B).
* **Side Effects:** Itching, burning, rash (topical); blurred vision, stinging (ophthalmic); rarely, allergic reactions, ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity; perforated eardrum (otic use); large open wounds/burns (topical).
* **Drug Interactions:** Topical use with other neomycin-containing products; systemic aminoglycosides and neuromuscular blockers.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution.  Limited data available. 
* **Dosage:** Topical: 1–3 times daily; Ophthalmic: every 3–4 hours for 7-10 days.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for signs of hypersensitivity reactions, ototoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. Assess the affected area for response to therapy.


## **Popular Combinations**

This medication is typically used as a standalone product. However, some formulations may contain additional ingredients like hydrocortisone (for anti-inflammatory effects) or pramoxine (for local anesthetic effect).



## **Precautions**

* Avoid contact with eyes, nose, and mouth (topical).
* Discontinue use if irritation or sensitization develops.
* Do not use for prolonged periods.
* Pre-existing hearing or renal impairment warrants caution.
