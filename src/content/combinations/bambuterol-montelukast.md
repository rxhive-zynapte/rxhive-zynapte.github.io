## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Bambuterol + Montelukast is prescribed for the long-term management of asthma and allergic rhinitis (hay fever) in patients who are not adequately controlled by other medications.  It helps to prevent and treat bronchospasm (narrowing of the airways) and improve breathing. It is also used to prevent exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination drug belongs to two classes:  Bambuterol is a bronchodilator (specifically, a long-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonist prodrug) and Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Bambuterol is metabolized to terbutaline, which relaxes the smooth muscles in the airways, leading to bronchodilation. Montelukast blocks the action of leukotrienes, inflammatory chemicals that cause bronchoconstriction, mucus production, and airway inflammation.

## **Alternate Names**

- There are no official alternate generic names.

- **Brand Names:** This combination is available under several brand names, including Montair Plus, Bmont, Montus BL, Lastair Plus, among others.  Availability of specific brands may vary by region.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Bambuterol, through its active metabolite terbutaline, acts on beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the lungs, causing smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation. Montelukast antagonizes the effects of cysteinyl leukotrienes by binding to CysLT1 receptors, thereby reducing inflammation and bronchoconstriction.  The combination provides both bronchodilation and anti-inflammatory effects.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Bambuterol is orally administered and is converted to terbutaline in the body.  Terbutaline is further metabolized and excreted primarily through the kidneys. Montelukast is also administered orally, rapidly absorbed, metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 enzymes, and excreted mainly in bile.  

- **Mode of Action:** Terbutaline, the active metabolite of Bambuterol, activates beta-2 adrenergic receptors, leading to an increase in intracellular cAMP levels. This, in turn, activates protein kinase A, which inhibits myosin light chain kinase and leads to smooth muscle relaxation.  Montelukast competitively inhibits the binding of leukotrienes to CysLT1 receptors, preventing the downstream effects of leukotrienes, including bronchoconstriction, mucus secretion, and eosinophil recruitment.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Terbutaline is primarily eliminated through renal excretion. Montelukast is primarily eliminated through biliary excretion, with a small portion undergoing renal excretion.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The standard dose is one tablet containing 10 mg bambuterol and 10 mg montelukast taken orally once daily, usually in the evening for asthma and at a time convenient for the patient for allergic rhinitis.

#### **Children:**

- The dosage in children depends on age:  4 mg montelukast and 5 mg bambuterol once daily may be prescribed by the physician depending on the child's age and condition.  Use in children below 2 years is generally not recommended. Pediatric use should be under strict medical supervision.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments are usually not required. However, monitoring is recommended due to potential increased sensitivity to side effects.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution should be exercised in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Dosage adjustments may be needed.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised in patients with hepatic impairment. Dosage adjustments may be necessary in cases of severe hepatic impairment.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, or seizure disorders should be monitored closely.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Bambuterol + Montelukast is intended for chronic management of asthma and allergic rhinitis and is not suitable for acute exacerbations. The drug is typically not used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  For acute episodes, rescue medications like short-acting beta-2 agonists or systemic corticosteroids are preferred.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be needed for patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction and other comorbid conditions as advised by the physician.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, upper respiratory tract infection, fever, sore throat, stomach pain, runny nose, fatigue, muscle cramps or spasms, restlessness, skin rash, tremor, palpitations, trembling, difficulty swallowing, heartburn, ear pain, blurred vision.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Suicidal behavior, depression, disorientation, anxiety, joint pain, chest tightness, angioedema, Churg-Strauss syndrome (a rare form of vasculitis), hepatic dysfunction, neuropsychiatric events (including agitation, aggression, hallucinations, depression, insomnia, tremor, and suicidal thinking).


### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term effects are still being studied. Regular monitoring for potential adverse events, especially neuropsychiatric symptoms, is recommended.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe skin rash and hives, difficulty in breathing, dizziness and fainting, muscle pain and weakness, increased thirst, irregular heartbeat, shaking and trembling of arms and feet, suicidal ideation, neuropsychiatric events, hepatic dysfunction.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to bambuterol, montelukast, or any components of the formulation.
- Acute asthma attacks.
- Severe hepatic impairment.
- Use with caution in patients with severe renal impairment, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, or seizure disorders.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol, atenolol): May decrease the effectiveness of bambuterol.
- Antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole): May increase the risk of side effects from both drugs.
- Antiepileptic medications (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin): May alter the metabolism of both drugs.
- Steroids (e.g., prednisolone):  Potential for additive effects.
- Theophylline:  May enhance the effects of bambuterol.
- Certain antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin): May increase the risk of side effects from both drugs.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Bambuterol + Montelukast should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  
- **Breastfeeding:**  Montelukast is excreted in human milk.  Caution should be exercised when administering to a nursing woman. Bambuterol is not recommended in breastfeeding women.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Bambuterol (prodrug of terbutaline): Beta-2 adrenergic agonist, bronchodilator. Montelukast: Leukotriene receptor antagonist, anti-inflammatory.
- **Side Effects:**  Headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, neuropsychiatric events (rare).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, acute asthma attacks, severe hepatic impairment.
