## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for inflammatory skin conditions with secondary bacterial and/or fungal infections.  It is effective against a range of dermatological issues, including:

*   Dermatitis with secondary infection
*   Tinea infections (ringworm, athlete's foot, jock itch) with an inflammatory component
*   Candidiasis (skin yeast infections) with an inflammatory component
*   Insect bites and stings with secondary infection

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This is a combination product containing drugs from different classifications:

*   Beclometasone: Corticosteroid (topical)
*   Chlorocresol: Antiseptic and preservative
*   Clotrimazole: Antifungal (imidazole derivative)
*   Neomycin: Aminoglycoside antibiotic

**Mechanism of Action:**

*   **Beclometasone:** Reduces inflammation and itching by suppressing the immune response and inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins.
*   **Chlorocresol:**  Acts as a preservative in the cream formulation and has antiseptic properties, preventing bacterial contamination of the product.
*   **Clotrimazole:** Inhibits the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes. This disruption leads to fungal cell death.
*   **Neomycin:**  Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death. It is effective against many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication is often referred to by different brand names depending on the manufacturer and region. Some possible brand names or variations include:

*   QD More Cream
*   Neonate Cream/Ointment
*   B.N. Clot Ointment
*   Mexaclo N Cream
*   Kunis Cream
*   Turboderm Cream

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

The combination exerts a synergistic effect by addressing the infection and inflammation simultaneously. Beclometasone reduces inflammation, while clotrimazole and neomycin target the fungal and bacterial components of the infection, respectively. Chlorocresol prevents further contamination.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Topical application results in minimal systemic absorption of the active ingredients under normal skin conditions. Increased absorption may occur with prolonged use, application to large areas, or if the skin barrier is compromised.
*   **Metabolism:** Beclometasone and clotrimazole are primarily metabolized in the liver.
*   **Elimination:** Neomycin is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine. Clotrimazole metabolites are excreted in bile and urine.

**Mode of Action:**

*   Beclometasone binds to glucocorticoid receptors, reducing inflammatory mediator production.
*   Neomycin interferes with bacterial ribosomal function, inhibiting protein synthesis.
*   Clotrimazole alters fungal cell membrane permeability, causing leakage and cell death.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a thin layer to the affected skin area twice daily (morning and evening) or as directed by the physician. Do not exceed 45 grams of cream per week unless under direct medical supervision. Treatment duration typically ranges from 2 weeks (tinea cruris, tinea corporis, candidiasis) to 4 weeks (tinea pedis).


#### **Children:**

Use in children under 12 years of age is generally not recommended unless specifically directed by a physician. Pediatric dosage should be determined by a doctor based on the child's age, weight, and the specific condition being treated. Some sources suggest it is not recommended for children under 17.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required. Close monitoring for adverse effects is advisable.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised due to the potential for neomycin absorption, particularly with extensive application or damaged skin. Monitor renal function, especially in cases of prolonged use or significant skin damage.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised. Monitor for systemic side effects.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider individual patient factors and potential drug interactions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is generally not indicated for systemic or internal use. It is intended for topical application on the skin only. Therefore, dosages relevant to intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations do not apply to this medication.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on the severity of the skin condition, patient's response to treatment, presence of renal or hepatic impairment, and coexisting medical conditions. Always consider individual patient factors.
