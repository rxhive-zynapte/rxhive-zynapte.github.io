## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the treatment of fungal infections of the mouth, particularly oral candidiasis (thrush). It also helps to alleviate the associated inflammation, pain, and discomfort.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing a corticosteroid (beclometasone), an analgesic (choline salicylate), and an antifungal agent (clotrimazole).
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Clotrimazole inhibits fungal growth by affecting the synthesis of ergosterol, a crucial component of the fungal cell membrane. Beclometasone exerts anti-inflammatory action by suppressing the immune response and reducing the production of inflammatory mediators. Choline salicylate provides analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no officially recognized alternate name for this combination.  However, it's often referred to as "clotrimazole/beclometasone/choline salicylate" or by specific brand names.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Beclometasone, a topical corticosteroid, binds to glucocorticoid receptors, leading to reduced inflammation, itching, and redness. Choline salicylate, an NSAID, inhibits cyclooxygenase, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, which mediates pain and inflammation. Clotrimazole alters fungal cell membrane permeability, ultimately resulting in fungal cell death.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily topical application; minimal systemic absorption. The small amounts absorbed are metabolized by the liver and excreted through the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:** Clotrimazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis, disrupting fungal cell membrane integrity. Beclometasone binds to glucocorticoid receptors, modulating gene expression and decreasing inflammation. Choline salicylate inhibits COX enzymes, decreasing prostaglandin synthesis and thus reducing inflammation and pain.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily topical. Any absorbed drug is metabolized hepatically and excreted renally.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** A thin layer is applied to the affected area 2–4 times daily, or as prescribed by a doctor.

#### **Children:** Use in children should be under strict medical supervision and for the shortest duration possible due to the potential for increased systemic absorption. Dosage is adjusted based on the child's age, weight, and the severity of the infection.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Generally, the adult dose is used but with careful monitoring for local and systemic adverse effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised; monitor for adverse effects.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised; monitor for adverse effects.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication is intended for topical oral use only. It's not indicated for systemic conditions or procedures such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on patient response and tolerance, and specific medical conditions.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Application site reactions (burning, irritation, itching, redness).
- Dry mouth.
- Changes in taste sensation.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Prolonged or excessive use of topical corticosteroids can lead to skin thinning, striae (stretch marks), and telangiectasia (spider veins).
