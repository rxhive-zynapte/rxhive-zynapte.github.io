## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for inflammatory skin conditions complicated by bacterial and/or fungal infections. These conditions may include:

*   Infected eczema and dermatitis
*   Impetigo
*   Infected psoriasis
*   Intertrigo (inflammation of skin folds)
*   Infected lichen planus
*   Scabies with secondary infection
*   Otitis externa
*   Diaper rash
*   Lichen simplex chronicus
*   Insect bites
*   Minor burns and infected wounds

**Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing a corticosteroid (Beclometasone), an antifungal (Clotrimazole), an antibiotic (Gentamicin), and an antibacterial/antifungal agent (Clioquinol).

**Mechanism of Action:**  This combination provides broad-spectrum antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory action. Beclometasone reduces inflammation and itching, Clotrimazole inhibits fungal growth, Gentamicin kills bacteria, and Clioquinol has both antibacterial and antifungal effects.

## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific four-drug combination, although the individual components have various synonyms.

**Brand Names:** Derminol, Clonem G (and others, depending on the region and manufacturer).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Beclometasone exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by binding to glucocorticoid receptors, which modulate gene transcription and decrease the production of inflammatory mediators.  Clotrimazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis, a crucial component of fungal cell membranes, leading to fungal cell death.  Gentamicin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. Clioquinol disrupts bacterial and fungal cell membranes.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily topical application. Systemic absorption is minimal under normal use but can increase with prolonged use, application to large areas, or damaged skin. Beclometasone is metabolized in the liver; Gentamicin is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys; Clotrimazole is metabolized in the liver; Clioquinol is partially metabolized and excreted in urine and feces.

**Mode of Action:** See Pharmacodynamics.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Beclometasone binds to glucocorticoid receptors. Clotrimazole inhibits the enzyme 14-alpha-demethylase, crucial for ergosterol synthesis. Gentamicin binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit.

**Elimination Pathways:** See Pharmacokinetics.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer to the affected area once or twice daily.

#### **Children:** Use with caution and under the guidance of a physician. Dosage depends on age, weight, and the specific condition being treated.


#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Similar to adult dosing, with careful monitoring for adverse effects.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Gentamicin component requires careful monitoring and potential dose adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Beclometasone and Clotrimazole are metabolized in the liver. Use with caution in hepatic impairment and monitor for adverse effects.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution in patients with diabetes, hypertension, or other systemic diseases due to the potential for increased systemic absorption of Beclometasone.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This topical medication is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU care. For emergency situations, this topical medication is not generally appropriate.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**  Adjustments based on patient response, tolerance, and severity of the infection. Renal and hepatic impairment may require dose modification, especially for the Gentamicin component.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Burning or stinging at the application site
*   Itching, irritation, redness, and dryness of the skin
*   Folliculitis
*   Hypopigmentation (skin lightening)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
*   Skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasia
*   Adrenal suppression (with prolonged or extensive use)
*   Cushing's syndrome (with prolonged or extensive use)

### **Long-Term Effects:** Skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, hypopigmentation.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** Allergic contact dermatitis, skin atrophy, adrenal suppression, Cushing's syndrome.

## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to any component
*   Viral skin infections (herpes simplex, varicella, vaccinia)
*   Tuberculosis or syphilitic skin lesions
*   Rosacea, acne, perioral dermatitis
*   Untreated fungal infections not susceptible to Clotrimazole

## **Drug Interactions**

*   Oral corticosteroids
*   NSAIDs
*   Oral hypoglycemics

*   Cyclosporine, cisplatin, neuromuscular blocking agents


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use with caution and only if clearly needed, under strict medical supervision.  Safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Potential fetal or neonatal risks should be weighed against the benefits of treatment.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:**  Combination of corticosteroid, antifungal, antibiotic, and antibacterial/antifungal agent.
*   **Side Effects:** Burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, hypopigmentation, skin atrophy, allergic reactions, adrenal suppression (with prolonged use).
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, viral skin infections, tuberculosis/syphilitic lesions, rosacea/acne/perioral dermatitis.
