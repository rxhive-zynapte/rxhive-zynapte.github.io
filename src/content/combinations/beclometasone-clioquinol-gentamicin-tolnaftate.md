## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the topical treatment of inflammatory skin disorders complicated by bacterial and fungal infections.  These include:

* Infected eczema or dermatitis
* Intertrigo
* Secondarily infected fungal infections (e.g., athlete's foot)
* Minor infected wounds or burns
* Otitis externa

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Corticosteroid (Beclometasone)
* Antibacterial (Gentamicin, Clioquinol)
* Antifungal (Tolnaftate, Clioquinol)


**Mechanism of Action:** This combination provides a multifaceted approach to treating skin infections:

* **Beclometasone:** Reduces inflammation, itching, and swelling.
* **Clioquinol:**  Combats both bacterial and fungal infections.
* **Gentamicin:** Kills bacteria, especially Gram-negative strains.
* **Tolnaftate:** Inhibits fungal growth.



## **Alternate Names**

* Quard Cream
* Naderm Cream
* Angloderm Cream
* Betamethasone + Clioquinol + Gentamicin + Tolnaftate Cream/Ointment/Lotion
* Beclometasone + Clioquinol (Iodochlorhydroxyquin) + Gentamicin + Tolnaftate


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Beclometasone:** Binds to glucocorticoid receptors, suppressing inflammatory mediators.
* **Clioquinol:** Disrupts microbial cell membrane stability.
* **Gentamicin:** Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to ribosomes.
* **Tolnaftate:** Inhibits fungal ergosterol biosynthesis, compromising cell membrane integrity.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* Topical application results in minimal systemic absorption, with most of the drug remaining localized.

**Elimination:**

* Primarily through renal and hepatic pathways.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a thin layer to the affected area two to three times daily. Treatment duration depends on the infection's severity and location, typically 2-4 weeks.  Do not use continuously for extended periods.

#### **Children:**

Use in children under 2 years of age is not recommended. For children over 2, the dosage should be determined by a physician, keeping in mind the child's age and the infection's severity.  Avoid application on large areas.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Generally, the standard adult dosage is applicable, but caution should be exercised in case of hepatic or renal impairment.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary. Consult a nephrologist for recommendations.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary. Consult a hepatologist for recommendations.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized assessment is required for patients with conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or immune suppression.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication is for topical use only and is not applicable for systemic clinical scenarios such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Modifications may be needed based on age, severity, response, and renal or hepatic function. Prolonged use may necessitate reduced frequency or potency.
