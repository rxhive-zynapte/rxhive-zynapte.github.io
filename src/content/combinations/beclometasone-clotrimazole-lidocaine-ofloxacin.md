## **Usage**

- This combination medication is prescribed for the treatment of otitis externa (outer ear infections) and otitis media (middle ear infections) caused by bacteria and fungi susceptible to the included antimicrobial agents. It is particularly effective for infections involving both bacterial and fungal components, as well as those accompanied by inflammation and pain.
- **Pharmacological Classifications**: This is a combination product containing drugs from multiple classes:
    - Beclometasone: Corticosteroid, anti-inflammatory
    - Clotrimazole: Antifungal
    - Lidocaine: Local anesthetic, analgesic
    - Ofloxacin: Fluoroquinolone antibiotic
- **Mechanism of Action**:
    - Beclometasone reduces inflammation by inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators.
    - Clotrimazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis, disrupting fungal cell membrane integrity and leading to fungal cell death.
    - Lidocaine blocks nerve conduction, providing local pain relief.
    - Ofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, essential enzymes for bacterial DNA replication and cell division.

## **Alternate Names**

- No internationally recognized non-proprietary name exists for this combination.  It is commonly referred to by the names of its components.
- **Brand Names**:  A number of brand names exist for this combination, including  Audicare, Amcure-O, Candiflox, Candistin,  Mix Biotic, Otobiotic-Plus, Otic-4, Otiflox, and Otoxin. Brand names may vary regionally.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: The combination exerts a synergistic effect against otic infections through its anti-inflammatory, antifungal, anesthetic, and antibiotic components.  Beclometasone reduces inflammation and edema in the ear canal, while clotrimazole targets fungal pathogens. Lidocaine provides rapid pain relief, and ofloxacin eliminates susceptible bacteria.
- **Pharmacokinetics**:
    - Absorption: Topical administration results in limited systemic absorption.
    - Metabolism: Primarily hepatic metabolism for clotrimazole, beclometasone, and lidocaine; minimal hepatic metabolism for ofloxacin.
    - Elimination: Primarily renal excretion for ofloxacin; hepatic metabolism and subsequent biliary/fecal excretion for other components.
- **Mode of Action**:
    - Beclometasone binds to glucocorticoid receptors, inhibiting inflammatory gene transcription.
    - Clotrimazole inhibits the enzyme 14-alpha-demethylase, preventing ergosterol synthesis.
    - Lidocaine blocks voltage-gated sodium channels, preventing nerve impulse transmission.
    - Ofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, disrupting DNA replication and transcription.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 2-5 drops into the affected ear 3-4 times daily for 7-14 days.

#### **Children:**

- For otitis externa with intact tympanic membrane: 2-5 drops into the affected ear 3-4 times daily for 7-14 days in children aged 6 months and older.
- For chronic suppurative otitis media with perforated tympanic membrane:  Use is generally limited to children 12 years and older, with the same dosage as adults.  However, some sources suggest avoiding use in children entirely, especially under 12 years of age, particularly when the eardrum is ruptured.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: Close monitoring is advised, although dosage adjustments are not typically necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Use cautiously, dose adjustments may be necessary. Monitor renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Use cautiously, dose adjustments may be necessary. Monitor liver function.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**:  Use with caution in patients with diabetes (beclometasone can affect blood sugar), glaucoma or cataracts (beclometasone can exacerbate these), or adrenal gland problems.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication is primarily indicated for otitis externa and otitis media.  It is not typically used in the listed clinical scenarios (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, emergency situations).

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient characteristics, including renal/hepatic function, comorbid conditions, and response to therapy.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Ear discomfort
- Irritation at the application site
- Burning or stinging sensation

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, difficulty breathing)

### **Long-Term Effects**

Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial resistance, or local skin atrophy with beclometasone.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

- Perforated tympanic membrane (for otitis media)
- Viral infections of the ear

## **Drug Interactions**

- Oral hypoglycemics: Beclometasone may affect blood sugar levels.
- Other local anesthetics: Increased risk of systemic toxicity.
- Class I antiarrhythmics:  Ofloxacin may interact with these medications.
- Drugs affecting bacterial DNA synthesis: Potential interactions with other drugs in this class.
