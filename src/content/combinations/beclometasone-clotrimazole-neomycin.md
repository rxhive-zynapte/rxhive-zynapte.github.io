## **Usage**

Beclometasone + Clotrimazole + Neomycin is a topical combination medication primarily prescribed for the treatment of superficial fungal and bacterial skin infections complicated by inflammation.  It's effective against a range of dermatological conditions, including:

*   **Infected eczema and dermatitis:**  Where inflammation and infection coexist.
*   **Infected tinea (ringworm):**  Such as athlete's foot (tinea pedis), jock itch (tinea cruris), and ringworm of the body (tinea corporis).

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This triple combination comprises drugs from three classes:

*   **Beclometasone:** Corticosteroid (anti-inflammatory)
*   **Clotrimazole:**  Antifungal (imidazole derivative)
*   **Neomycin:**  Antibiotic (aminoglycoside)

**Mechanism of Action:**

*   Beclometasone:  Reduces inflammation by suppressing the immune response, decreasing redness, swelling, and itching.
*   Clotrimazole:  Inhibits ergosterol synthesis, a crucial component of fungal cell membranes, leading to fungal cell death.
*   Neomycin:  Interferes with bacterial protein synthesis, inhibiting bacterial growth.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication doesn't have an internationally recognized non-proprietary name. It's often referred to by the names of its components. Brand names vary depending on the region and manufacturer. Some examples include *Ovix Cream*.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

The combined action of the three components provides anti-inflammatory, antifungal, and antibacterial effects, addressing both the infection and the associated inflammation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   Absorption: Minimal systemic absorption when applied topically to intact skin.
*   Metabolism:  Limited information available on the specific metabolic pathways of the combined formulation when applied topically. Individually, beclometasone is metabolized in the liver, clotrimazole is metabolized primarily in the liver, and neomycin is not significantly metabolized.
*   Elimination: Primarily through hepatic (liver) excretion for beclometasone and clotrimazole. Neomycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.

**Mode of Action:**

*   Beclometasone: Binds to glucocorticoid receptors, modulating gene expression and inhibiting inflammatory mediators.
*   Clotrimazole: Inhibits the enzyme 14-alpha-demethylase, essential for ergosterol synthesis in fungal cell membranes.
*   Neomycin:  Binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit in bacteria, interfering with protein synthesis.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

A thin layer is applied to the affected skin area two to three times daily. The duration of treatment typically ranges from 7 to 14 days, depending on the condition's severity and response to treatment.

#### **Children:**

Use in children should be under strict medical supervision due to the potential for increased systemic absorption and the risk of side effects from the corticosteroid component. The dosage and frequency should be adjusted based on the child's age, weight, and the specific condition being treated.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments mentioned but close monitoring is advisable.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is recommended due to potential neomycin accumulation.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised as beclometasone and clotrimazole are metabolized in the liver.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized assessment and dosage adjustments may be necessary.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  This medication is designed solely for topical application to the skin.  It is **not** indicated for use in settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments might be needed based on factors like the severity of the infection, the patient's response to therapy, and any co-existing medical conditions.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

*   Burning or stinging sensation at the application site
*   Itching, irritation, redness, or dryness of the skin


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

*   Allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing)
*   Skin atrophy or thinning with prolonged use
*   Secondary infections


### **Long-Term Effects**

Prolonged or excessive use of topical corticosteroids can lead to skin thinning, striae (stretch marks), telangiectasia (spider veins), and hypopigmentation (loss of skin color).


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Any signs of allergic reaction or severe skin irritation warrant immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to any of the components.
*   Viral skin infections (e.g., herpes simplex, chickenpox).
*   Tuberculosis or syphilis of the skin.
*   Acne or rosacea.
*   Open wounds or broken skin.

## **Drug Interactions**

*   Interactions with polyene antibiotics (e.g., amphotericin B, nystatin) may occur.
*   Concomitant use of other topical medications on the same area should be discussed with a physician.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of using Beclometasone + Clotrimazole + Neomycin during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not well established. Consult a doctor before using this combination if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
