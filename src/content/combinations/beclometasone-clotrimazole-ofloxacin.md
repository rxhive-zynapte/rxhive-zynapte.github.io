## **Usage**

Beclometasone + Clotrimazole + Ofloxacin is prescribed for the treatment of otitis externa (outer ear infections) and otitis media (middle ear infections) where bacterial and fungal infections coexist with inflammation.  It is a combination drug belonging to the following pharmacological classifications:

* **Corticosteroid:** Beclometasone (anti-inflammatory)
* **Antifungal:** Clotrimazole
* **Antibiotic:** Ofloxacin


**Mechanism of Action:**  This triple combination combats ear infections through distinct mechanisms: Beclometasone reduces inflammation, Clotrimazole inhibits fungal growth, and Ofloxacin eliminates bacterial infection.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication might not have a universally recognized international non-proprietary name (INN). It's often identified by its constituent drugs. Several brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region. Some examples found were *Otichek*, *Amcure-O*, *Otobiotic-Plus*, *Otiflox*, and *Oflokan*.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Beclometasone:**  A corticosteroid that exerts its anti-inflammatory action by binding to glucocorticoid receptors, inhibiting inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes, thus reducing swelling, redness, and itching.
* **Clotrimazole:** An antifungal agent that inhibits ergosterol synthesis, a crucial component of fungal cell membranes. This disruption leads to increased cell membrane permeability and fungal cell death.
* **Ofloxacin:** A fluoroquinolone antibiotic that inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair. This inhibition ultimately leads to bacterial cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

Primarily administered as ear drops, the systemic absorption of these drugs is minimal.  While some absorption may occur through the inflamed ear canal skin or perforated eardrum, it's generally considered low.  Limited information is available regarding the specific metabolic pathways and elimination routes for topical otic administration of this combination. However, it's expected that any systemically absorbed drug would follow the typical metabolic and excretion pathways of each individual component (hepatic metabolism for Beclometasone and Clotrimazole, renal and hepatic excretion for Ofloxacin).


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Instill 2-5 drops into the affected ear 3-4 times daily for 7-14 days.  The dosage may vary depending on the severity of the infection.

#### **Children:**

Use in children should be under the strict guidance of a pediatrician or ENT specialist.  Dosage adjustments based on age are necessary.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are generally recommended, but monitoring for systemic side effects, especially with perforated eardrums, is advisable.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution is advised, especially if the eardrum is perforated, as even minimal systemic absorption of Ofloxacin might necessitate dosage adjustments.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Similar caution is recommended due to potential Beclometasone and Clotrimazole metabolism impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Patients with diabetes should be monitored for potential blood glucose fluctuations with prolonged use of Beclometasone.  If the eardrum is perforated, consider potential drug interactions in patients on other medications metabolized by CYP enzymes (Ofloxacin).

### **Clinical Use Cases**  Dosage in clinical situations beyond otitis externa and otitis media with intact or perforated eardrums is not applicable for this drug combination.


### **Dosage Adjustments**
Dosage adjustments are based on patient age, the severity of infection, and the presence of a perforated eardrum. Consult a specialist for individualized dosing.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Ear discomfort
* Irritation, burning, or stinging at the application site
* Itching

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
* Allergic reactions
* Hearing loss
* Dizziness or vertigo
* Headache


### **Long-Term Effects**
Prolonged use might lead to skin thinning or hypopigmentation at the application site. Systemic effects of corticosteroids are unlikely with topical otic administration unless the eardrum is perforated.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions necessitate immediate discontinuation and medical intervention.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any of the components
* Perforated tympanic membrane (for some formulations or age groups)

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Beclometasone:**  May interact with other corticosteroids (additive effects) or drugs metabolized by CYP3A4.
* **Clotrimazole:** Interactions with other antifungals are not typically significant with topical application.
* **Ofloxacin:** May interact with certain antibiotics, anticoagulants, antidiabetics, and other drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not fully established. Consult a physician before use.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Beclometasone: Anti-inflammatory (corticosteroid); Clotrimazole: Antifungal; Ofloxacin: Antibacterial (fluoroquinolone).
* **Side Effects:** Ear discomfort, irritation, itching, rarely allergic reactions, hearing loss.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, perforated eardrum (in certain cases).
* **Drug Interactions:**  Limited with topical application, but consider potential interactions if eardrum is perforated.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Consult a doctor.
* **Dosage:**  2-5 drops 3-4 times/day for 7-14 days (adjust for children or special cases).
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Observe for local irritation, allergic reactions, and hearing changes.

## **Popular Combinations**

This formulation itself represents a popular combination of three distinct drug classes to address ear infections with co-existing bacterial and fungal components and inflammation.



## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:**  Assess for hypersensitivity and eardrum integrity.
* **Specific Populations:** Consult a physician for use during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and for use in children.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  No specific lifestyle restrictions.
