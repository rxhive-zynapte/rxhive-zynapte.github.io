      What is the recommended dosage for Beclometasone + Formoterol?**


      **A:**  For adults and children 12 years and older with asthma, the usual
      maintenance dose is 1 or 2 inhalations twice daily. In the MART regimen,
      the same maintenance dose is used with additional inhalations taken as
      needed for symptom relief, up to a maximum of 6 reliever puffs per day and
      a total daily dose of 8 puffs.  For adults with COPD, the recommended dose
      is 2 inhalations twice daily.

      Can Beclometasone + Formoterol be used to treat acute asthma attacks?**


      **A:** No. Beclometasone + Formoterol is *not* for acute bronchospasm.
      Patients should have a separate short-acting bronchodilator (e.g.,

## **Usage**

Beclometasone + Formoterol is prescribed for the regular long-term treatment of asthma in adults and children 12 years and older not adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and “as needed” inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists or whose asthma is already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2-agonists.  It is also used to treat the symptoms of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Beclometasone: Inhaled Corticosteroid (ICS)
* Formoterol: Long-acting Beta2-adrenergic Agonist (LABA)

**Mechanism of Action:**  This combination medication works through two distinct mechanisms:

* **Beclometasone:**  Reduces inflammation in the airways by suppressing inflammatory cells and mediators, thus decreasing swelling and irritation.
* **Formoterol:** Relaxes the muscles around the airways, leading to bronchodilation and improved airflow to the lungs.


## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate generic names.  "Beclometasone Dipropionate + Formoterol Fumarate Dihydrate" represents the full chemical names of the components.
Some popular Brand names Foster, Fostair


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Beclometasone:**  Exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the airways, inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines and other mediators. This leads to reduced airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation.
* **Formoterol:** Stimulates beta2-adrenergic receptors in the lungs, causing smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation, improving airflow.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Beclometasone:** Inhaled beclometasone dipropionate is rapidly absorbed through the lungs. It undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism by esterase enzymes to its active metabolite, beclometasone-17-monopropionate. Systemic absorption is relatively low, minimizing systemic side effects. It is primarily metabolized in the liver and eliminated via biliary and renal excretion.
* **Formoterol:**  Rapidly absorbed after inhalation with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 30 minutes to 1 hour.  It is metabolized primarily by direct glucuronidation and O-demethylation and excreted in the urine.  Formoterol demonstrates a longer duration of action compared to short-acting beta2-agonists.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**

* Beclometasone: Binds to glucocorticoid receptors.
* Formoterol: Stimulates beta2-adrenergic receptors.

**Elimination Pathways:**

* Beclometasone: Hepatic metabolism and biliary/renal excretion.
* Formoterol: Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (Asthma):**

* **Maintenance Therapy:** 1-2 inhalations twice daily.
* **Maintenance and Reliever Therapy (MART):**  Regular maintenance dose (1-2 inhalations twice daily) plus additional inhalations as needed for symptom relief (maximum 6 reliever puffs per day, maximum total daily dose 8 puffs).

#### **Adults (COPD):**

* 2 inhalations twice daily.

#### **Children (12-17 years - Asthma):**

* Same as adult asthma dosing.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment needed.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; monitor renal function.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution; monitor liver function.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring for patients with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, hypokalemia, or seizures.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Beclometasone + Formoterol is *not* indicated for:

* **Intubation**
* **Surgical Procedures**
* **Mechanical Ventilation**
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
* **Emergency Situations** (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest).  A short-acting bronchodilator should be used for acute exacerbations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient response and tolerability. The lowest effective dose should be used.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

* Throat irritation
* Hoarseness
* Cough
* Oral candidiasis (thrush)
* Headache
* Tremor
* Palpitations
* Dizziness

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Paradoxical bronchospasm
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Hypokalemia
* Hyperglycemia
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Adrenal suppression (with prolonged high doses)
* Pneumonia


### **Long-Term Effects:**

* Osteoporosis (with high doses)
* Growth retardation in children (with high doses)
* Cataracts
* Glaucoma


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

* Angioedema
* Urticaria



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to beclometasone, formoterol, or any of the excipients.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Beta-blockers:** Reduce the bronchodilating effects of formoterol.
* **Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole):** May increase systemic exposure to beclometasone.
* **Other sympathomimetics:** May potentiate cardiovascular effects.
* **Diuretics, Xanthine derivatives, Steroids:** May exacerbate hypokalemia.
* **MAO inhibitors, Tricyclic antidepressants:** May increase the risk of cardiovascular adverse events.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Use only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  Limited human data.  Animal studies show adverse effects at high doses.
* **Breastfeeding:** Beclometasone is excreted in breast milk in small amounts.  Use with caution. Monitor infant for potential side effects.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Beclometasone: Anti-inflammatory (corticosteroid); Formoterol: Bronchodilator (LABA)
* **Side Effects:**  Throat irritation, hoarseness, cough, oral candidiasis, headache, tremor, palpitations.  Rarely: paradoxical bronchospasm, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, cardiac arrhythmias, adrenal suppression.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to components.
* **Drug Interactions:** Beta-blockers, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, sympathomimetics, diuretics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
* **Dosage:** Asthma (adults/children ≥12 years): 1-2 inhalations twice daily (maintenance), + additional inhalations PRN (MART); COPD (adults): 2 inhalations twice daily.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Lung function (FEV1, PEF), blood glucose, serum potassium, signs of thrush, growth in children.


## **Popular Combinations**

Beclometasone and formoterol are typically used in a fixed-dose combination inhaler. Combining an ICS and LABA provides synergistic effects, achieving better asthma/COPD control compared to either drug alone.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Monitor for adverse effects, including oral candidiasis, hyperglycemia, and hypokalemia.
* **Specific Populations:**  Use with caution in patients with cardiac disease, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, and hypokalemia.  Monitor growth in children receiving long-term treatment.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Rinsing mouth after each inhalation and regular dental hygiene can help prevent oral thrush.  Advise patients to avoid smoking and exposure to respiratory irritants.
