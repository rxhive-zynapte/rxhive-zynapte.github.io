## **Usage**

Beclometasone + Fusidic acid is prescribed for inflammatory skin disorders, such as eczema and dermatitis, complicated by bacterial infection, especially those caused by *Staphylococcus aureus*.  It combines the anti-inflammatory action of a corticosteroid (Beclometasone) with the antibiotic effect of Fusidic acid.  

It's pharmacological classifications are:
- Corticosteroid (Beclometasone)
- Antibiotic (Fusidic acid)

Beclometasone reduces inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators. Fusidic acid inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, thus stopping bacterial growth.

## **Alternate Names** 

While "Beclometasone + Fusidic Acid" is the common generic name, variations exist internationally and regionally. Beclomethasone may sometimes be used interchangeably with Beclometasone. Some popular brand names include Fucicort, Fucibet, and Fusidil B.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Beclometasone, a glucocorticoid, exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm. This complex then translocates to the nucleus, modulating gene transcription and ultimately suppressing the inflammatory cascade. Fusidic acid inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to elongation factor G (EF-G), preventing translocation of the ribosome along mRNA.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Beclometasone, when applied topically, is absorbed percutaneously. The extent of absorption depends on factors like skin integrity and the use of occlusive dressings.  It's metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted via the kidneys and in bile. Fusidic acid, applied topically, has limited systemic absorption through intact skin. It primarily remains in the stratum corneum. However, some absorption can occur with compromised skin barrier or prolonged application, especially in children, leading to low systemic levels. It's excreted primarily in bile, with minimal renal excretion. 

**Mode of Action:** Beclometasone suppresses inflammation by binding to glucocorticoid receptors. Fusidic acid disrupts bacterial protein synthesis by binding to EF-G.

**Elimination pathways:** Both drugs are primarily excreted/eliminated through the hepato-biliary system, with Beclometasone having greater renal excretion than Fusidic Acid.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**  
#### **Adults:**  
Apply a thin layer to the affected area twice daily.  Treatment duration should not typically exceed two weeks.


#### **Children:**  
Use in children should be under strict medical supervision due to increased risk of systemic absorption and side effects. Use on large areas of skin and for prolonged durations should be avoided. Apply a thin layer to the affected area, frequency, and duration based on age, weight, and disease severity, as determined by the physician.


#### **Special Cases:**  
- **Elderly Patients:** Similar to adults, but monitor for skin atrophy with prolonged use.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution advised; monitor for systemic side effects if using over large areas or for prolonged periods.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution advised; monitor for systemic side effects if using over large areas or for prolonged periods.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with diabetes, Cushing's syndrome, glaucoma, or other conditions that may be exacerbated by corticosteroids.



### **Clinical Use Cases**  
Beclometasone + Fusidic Acid is intended for topical use on the skin. It is not relevant to clinical scenarios such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.



### **Dosage Adjustments**  
Dosage adjustments should be made based on patient response, disease severity, and the presence of any adverse effects. In patients with renal or hepatic impairment,  close monitoring for systemic side effects is recommended, especially with prolonged use or application over large skin areas.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**  
Itching, burning, irritation, dryness, redness, and rash at the application site.



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**  
Skin atrophy, telangiectasia (spider veins), hypopigmentation, hypertrichosis (increased hair growth), perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis. Systemic effects like adrenal suppression (with prolonged use over large areas, particularly in children).



### **Long-Term Effects**  
Skin thinning, striae (stretch marks), and changes in skin pigmentation.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Severe allergic reactions (rare).




## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to either Beclometasone, Fusidic acid, or any component of the formulation. Rosacea, acne, perioral dermatitis, primary bacterial, viral (e.g., herpes simplex, chickenpox), or fungal skin infections, tuberculosis or syphilis of the skin, open wounds, or ulcers.


## **Drug Interactions**


Clinically significant interactions with topical application are rare.  However, concomitant use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, especially over large areas or with occlusive dressings, might theoretically increase systemic absorption and side effects of Beclometasone.  Avoid concomitant use with other topical corticosteroids.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use only if clearly needed and the potential benefits outweigh the risks.  Topical application minimizes fetal exposure.  If used during breastfeeding, avoid application on the breasts to prevent infant ingestion.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Beclometasone: anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid, Fusidic acid: antibiotic inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis.
- **Side Effects:**  Common: Itching, burning, irritation, dryness, redness, rash at application site.  Serious: Skin atrophy, telangiectasia, hypopigmentation, hypertrichosis, allergic contact dermatitis, adrenal suppression.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, rosacea, acne, perioral dermatitis, viral/fungal/TB/syphilis skin infections, open wounds/ulcers.
- **Drug Interactions:** Limited with topical use; potential interaction with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors when applied over large areas.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks; avoid breast application during lactation.
- **Dosage:** Adults and children: Thin layer twice daily for up to 2 weeks; adjust for children based on age, weight, and condition.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for local skin reactions and signs of systemic absorption (e.g., Cushingoid features in children).


## **Popular Combinations**
Typically not combined with other drugs topically due to its dual action.

## **Precautions**
Do not apply near eyes, mouth, or open wounds. Do not occlude treated area unless directed by physician. Do not use on broken skin. Wash hands after application.
