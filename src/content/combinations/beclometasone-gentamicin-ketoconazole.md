## **Usage**

Beclometasone + Gentamicin + Ketoconazole is a topical combination medication primarily prescribed for inflammatory skin infections caused by fungi and bacteria.  It's effective against conditions like athlete's foot (tinea pedis), jock itch (tinea cruris), ringworm (tinea corporis), and other dermatophytoses and candidiasis.  This combination is particularly useful when inflammation, itching, and secondary bacterial infection accompany the fungal infection.

**Pharmacological Classifications:**

* **Beclometasone:** Corticosteroid (anti-inflammatory, antipruritic)
* **Gentamicin:** Aminoglycoside antibiotic (bactericidal)
* **Ketoconazole:** Imidazole antifungal (fungistatic/fungicidal)

**Mechanism of Action:**  Beclometasone reduces inflammation and itching by suppressing the immune response. Gentamicin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death. Ketoconazole disrupts fungal cell membrane synthesis by inhibiting ergosterol production.


## **Alternate Names**

This triple combination medication is not widely known by an international non-proprietary name (INN). It is usually referred to by the names of its constituents. Brand names vary depending on the region and manufacturer. Some examples of Brand names are Kenozole BG Cream.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Beclometasone:** Binds to glucocorticoid receptors, reducing inflammation by decreasing vascular permeability, inhibiting leukocyte migration, and suppressing inflammatory mediator release.
* **Gentamicin:** Irreversibly binds to bacterial 30S ribosomal subunits, inhibiting protein synthesis and causing cell death.
* **Ketoconazole:** Inhibits fungal cytochrome P450 enzymes, specifically 14-alpha-demethylase, which disrupts ergosterol synthesis, a critical component of the fungal cell membrane. This leads to increased cell membrane permeability and fungal cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

Topical application limits systemic absorption.  A small amount of Beclometasone may be absorbed, metabolized in the liver, and excreted in the urine and feces. Gentamicin is minimally absorbed topically.  Ketoconazole absorption is also limited after topical application. Any absorbed Ketoconazole is metabolized by the liver (primarily via CYP3A4) and excreted in the feces and urine.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  A thin layer of cream is usually applied to the affected area twice daily, in the morning and evening for 1-2 weeks depending on the infection. Consult specific product labeling as concentrations may vary.

#### **Children:** Use in children is not recommended for certain formulations.  Consult product-specific guidelines and pediatric recommendations.

#### **Special Cases:**
* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution. Monitor for skin thinning and other adverse effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Topical application minimizes risk; however, caution is advised.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Topical application minimizes risk; however, caution is advised.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution in patients with diabetes,  immunosuppression, or those with compromised skin barrier function.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources do not contain dosing recommendations for clinical use cases such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
Adjustments may be needed based on severity, location, and response to therapy.  Avoid prolonged use or application to large areas.
