## **Usage**

Beclometasone + Ketoconazole + Neomycin is a topical combination medication primarily prescribed for inflammatory skin disorders complicated by bacterial and fungal infections.  These infections include:

*   Bacterial skin infections like impetigo or folliculitis.
*   Fungal skin infections like tinea pedis (athlete's foot), tinea cruris (jock itch), or tinea corporis (ringworm).
*   Inflammatory skin conditions like eczema or dermatitis, with secondary bacterial/fungal infections.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This medication combines three drug classes:

*   **Beclometasone:** Corticosteroid (anti-inflammatory, antipruritic)
*   **Ketoconazole:**  Antifungal (imidazole derivative)
*   **Neomycin:**  Antibiotic (aminoglycoside)

**Mechanism of Action:**

*   **Beclometasone:**  Reduces inflammation and itching by suppressing the immune response and inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins.
*   **Ketoconazole:** Inhibits fungal growth by disrupting the synthesis of ergosterol, a crucial component of the fungal cell membrane.
*   **Neomycin:** Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death.


## **Alternate Names**

This triple combination medication doesn't have a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN).  It is referred to by the combination of its active ingredients.


**Brand Names:**

Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region. Some examples include:

*   Dermitor KT
*   Ketonate
*   Various other generic formulations



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

*   **Beclometasone:** Exerts its anti-inflammatory and antipruritic effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the skin, modulating gene expression and ultimately reducing inflammation.
*   **Ketoconazole:**  Acts by inhibiting the enzyme 14-alpha-demethylase, which is essential for ergosterol synthesis in fungi.  This leads to altered fungal cell membrane permeability and fungal cell death.
*   **Neomycin:**  Binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit in bacteria, interfering with protein synthesis and leading to bacterial cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

Topical application minimizes systemic absorption. However, some absorption may occur, particularly with prolonged use over large areas or with occlusive dressings.

*   **Beclometasone:** Metabolized primarily in the liver.
*   **Ketoconazole:** Metabolized in the liver.
*   **Neomycin:** Primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

A thin layer is applied to the affected skin two to three times daily. Duration of treatment usually ranges from 2 to 4 weeks depending on the condition and physician's assessment.

#### **Children:**

Use in children under 2 years is generally not recommended.  For children older than 2 years, the dosage and duration should be determined by a physician and is typically lower than the adult dose.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lowest effective dose and monitor closely for adverse effects.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Neomycin should be used with caution due to the potential for systemic absorption and nephrotoxicity.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution, as both beclometasone and ketoconazole are metabolized in the liver.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Monitor blood glucose levels in diabetic patients, as beclometasone can affect glucose metabolism.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The medication is specifically designed for topical dermatological use and hence is not used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. 


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments to dosage may be necessary depending on patient-specific factors like renal or hepatic impairment. It is essential to follow the physician's recommendations for dosage adjustments.



## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects**

*   Burning
*   Itching
*   Stinging
*   Dryness
*   Redness
*   Irritation at the application site


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

*   Allergic contact dermatitis
*   Skin atrophy
*   Hypopigmentation
*   Telangiectasia
*   Secondary infection


### **Long-Term Effects**

Prolonged use of topical corticosteroids can lead to skin atrophy, telangiectasia, and striae.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions are rare but require immediate medical attention. Symptoms may include rash, itching, swelling, dizziness, or difficulty breathing.



## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to any of the components.
*   Viral skin infections (e.g., herpes simplex, varicella).
*   Tuberculosis or syphilitic skin lesions.
*   Rosacea or acne.
*   Generally contraindicated in children under 2 years of age.





## **Drug Interactions**

*   Concurrent use of other topical steroids can increase the risk of side effects.
*   Oral corticosteroids may interact with topical beclometasone.
*   Ketoconazole is a CYP3A4 inhibitor and can interact with drugs metabolized by this enzyme.
*   Neuromuscular blocking agents may interact with neomycin.




## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult a physician before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Topical application minimizes systemic absorption, but potential benefits should be weighed against risks.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:**  Combination of a corticosteroid (anti-inflammatory), an antifungal, and an antibiotic.
*   **Side Effects:** Burning, itching, stinging, dryness, redness, and irritation; rarely, skin atrophy, hypopigmentation.
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, viral skin infections, tuberculosis/syphilitic lesions, acne, rosacea.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Other topical steroids, oral corticosteroids, CYP3A4 substrates, neuromuscular blockers.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Consult a physician before use.
*   **Dosage:**  Apply a thin layer 2-3 times daily, duration 2-4 weeks, as directed by a physician.
*   **Monitoring Parameters:** Observe the treated area for improvement or adverse reactions. Monitor blood glucose in diabetic patients.
