## **Usage**

Beclometasone + Ketoconazole is a topical medication primarily prescribed for fungal skin infections, such as athlete's foot (tinea pedis), jock itch (tinea cruris), ringworm (tinea corporis), and seborrheic dermatitis, especially when accompanied by inflammation and itching.  It combines a corticosteroid (Beclometasone) with an antifungal (Ketoconazole).

* **Pharmacological Classification:**  Corticosteroid (Beclometasone) and Antifungal (Ketoconazole) combination.

* **Mechanism of Action:** Ketoconazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis, a crucial component of fungal cell membranes, leading to fungal cell death.  Beclometasone, a corticosteroid, provides anti-inflammatory, antipruritic (anti-itch), and vasoconstrictive effects, thus reducing swelling, redness, and itching associated with the infection.


## **Alternate Names**

While "Beclometasone + Ketoconazole" is the generic name, the specific names may vary depending on the region.

* **Brand Names:** Various brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and country. Examples include Keto-B, Ketozix B, and others. Consult local pharmaceutical resources for specific brand names available in India.


## **How It Works**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Ketoconazole exerts its antifungal action by inhibiting the cytochrome P450 enzyme lanosterol 14Î±-demethylase, which is essential for ergosterol synthesis in fungal cell membranes.  This disruption of ergosterol production alters membrane permeability, causing leakage of cellular contents and ultimately fungal cell death. Beclometasone, a potent glucocorticoid, binds to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors, modulating gene expression and inhibiting the inflammatory cascade. It reduces the production of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes, leading to decreased vasodilation, edema, and pruritus.

* **Pharmacokinetics:** Beclometasone + Ketoconazole is applied topically.  Percutaneous absorption of both drugs is limited, minimizing systemic effects.  Absorbed Ketoconazole is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted in bile and feces, while Beclometasone is metabolized in the liver and excreted mainly in the urine.  

* **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism and biliary/fecal excretion for Ketoconazole. Primarily hepatic metabolism and urinary excretion for Beclometasone.  


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults and Children over 12:** Apply a thin layer to the clean, dry affected skin and surrounding area once or twice daily, as directed by a physician.  Treatment duration typically ranges from 2 to 6 weeks, depending on the infection and its severity.

#### **Children under 12:** Use in children under 12 is generally not recommended unless specifically directed by a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution. Monitor for local skin reactions and potential systemic absorption.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised. Closely monitor for adverse events.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised due to the potential for increased systemic absorption of Ketoconazole.  Closely monitor liver function tests (LFTs).
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with diabetes, glaucoma, cataracts, or other conditions that may be exacerbated by corticosteroids.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Beclometasone + Ketoconazole is **not** indicated for systemic use and therefore has no application in the following clinical settings:

* Intubation
* Surgical Procedures
* Mechanical Ventilation
* Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use
* Emergency Situations


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary depending on individual patient factors, such as the severity of infection, location and size of the affected area, and the patient's response to therapy. Close monitoring for efficacy and adverse events is crucial.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Itching
* Burning
* Stinging
* Dryness
* Redness at the application site
* Skin irritation


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Skin atrophy (thinning)
* Hypopigmentation (skin lightening)
* Telangiectasia (spider veins)
* Hypertrichosis (excess hair growth)
* Folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles)
* Allergic contact dermatitis


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Prolonged or excessive use of topical corticosteroids can lead to skin atrophy, telangiectasia, and other skin changes. Systemic absorption, though minimal, can potentially cause adrenal suppression with long-term use over large areas.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions (rare) including angioedema, urticaria, and anaphylaxis.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to Beclometasone, Ketoconazole, or any component of the formulation.
* Viral skin infections (herpes simplex, varicella zoster).
* Tuberculous or syphilitic skin lesions.
* Rosacea.
* Acne.
* Perioral dermatitis.


## **Drug Interactions**

* Other topical or systemic corticosteroids (may potentiate effects).
* Immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine).
* Antifungal medications (e.g., itraconazole, fluconazole, may alter metabolism).
* Certain antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Use with caution during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Topical application minimizes systemic absorption, but potential risks should be discussed with the patient.

* **Breastfeeding:** Exercise caution while breastfeeding. Although systemic absorption is limited with topical application, it is unknown whether Beclometasone and Ketoconazole are excreted in breast milk.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Ketoconazole: Inhibits ergosterol synthesis.  Beclometasone: Binds to glucocorticoid receptors, reducing inflammation.
* **Side Effects:** Local: Itching, burning, dryness, redness. Systemic (rare): Adrenal suppression, hyperglycemia.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, viral skin infections, tuberculosis, rosacea.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Other corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, antifungals, certain antibiotics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
* **Dosage:** Apply thinly once or twice daily to affected area.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for local skin reactions and signs of systemic absorption, especially with prolonged use. Liver function tests (LFTs) should be monitored periodically, particularly in patients with hepatic dysfunction.


## **Popular Combinations**

Beclometasone and Ketoconazole are frequently combined in a single formulation, representing the clinically relevant combination for topical treatment of inflammatory fungal skin infections. Combinations with neomycin (an antibiotic) are also available for infections with a suspected bacterial component.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** For external use only.  Avoid contact with eyes, nose, and mouth. Do not use on open wounds or broken skin. Wash hands after application.

* **Specific Populations:** Pregnant and breastfeeding women should use with caution under medical supervision. Not generally recommended for children under 12 years.
