      How should patients administer the inhaler?**


      **A:** Patients should be instructed on proper inhaler technique to ensure
      optimal drug delivery. This includes shaking the inhaler, exhaling
      completely, placing lips tightly around the mouthpiece, inhaling deeply
      while activating the inhaler, holding breath for 10 seconds, then exhaling
      slowly.  A spacer device may be helpful for some patients.

      Can Beclometasone + Levosalbutamol be used for acute asthma attacks?**


      **A:** No, this medication is intended for long-term prevention and

      bronchodilator (like Salbutamol) is usually prescribed as rescue
      medication.

## **Usage**

- Beclometasone + Levosalbutamol is prescribed for the prevention and management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  It is also indicated for managing bronchospasm in patients with reversible obstructive airway disease.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination drug containing a corticosteroid (Beclometasone) and a bronchodilator (Levosalbutamol).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Beclometasone reduces inflammation and swelling in the airways.  Levosalbutamol relaxes the muscles lining the airways, widening them and improving airflow.

## **Alternate Names**

- Beclomethasone Dipropionate + Levosalbutamol/Levalbuterol
-  Beclometasone + Levalbuterol (Levosalbutamol)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Beclometasone exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the airways, reducing the production and release of inflammatory mediators. Levosalbutamol, a short-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist, relaxes bronchial smooth muscle by stimulating beta2-adrenergic receptors, leading to bronchodilation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Both drugs are administered via inhalation.  Beclometasone has low systemic absorption, minimizing systemic side effects. Levosalbutamol is absorbed into the lungs, with some systemic absorption.  Both are metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily through the kidneys.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial: One to two puffs (40-80 mcg of beclometasone and levosalbutamol dosage will vary depending on the specific product) twice a day.
- Maintenance: Titrate to the lowest effective dose once asthma stability is achieved.  The maximum dose generally should not exceed 320 mcg twice daily (Beclometasone component). Levosalbutamol dosage will vary based on the product.

#### **Children:**

- **4 to 11 years:** Initial: One puff (containing 40 mcg of beclometasone, levosalbutamol dosage varies) twice daily.
- Maintenance: Dose can be increased up to 80 mcg beclometasone twice daily, with corresponding levosalbutamol dose adjustments.  Titrate to the lowest effective dose for maintenance.
- **Under 4 years:** Not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate therapy with a low dose and adjust carefully.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution; dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use cautiously in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, hypokalemia, and seizure disorders.


### **Clinical Use Cases**
- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations:** This combination is not typically used in these acute settings. Short-acting bronchodilators alone or in combination with systemic corticosteroids are preferred in these cases.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments should be made based on individual patient response, asthma severity, and any comorbid conditions. Patients with liver or kidney impairment may require lower doses.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Headache

- Cardiac glycosides (e.g., digoxin)
- Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., selegiline)
- Tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline)
- Other sympathomimetic agents (e.g., pseudoephedrine)

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (Consult a physician).  Use only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
- **Breastfeeding:**  It is unknown if beclometasone or levosalbutamol are excreted in breast milk. Use cautiously during breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Corticosteroid reduces inflammation; bronchodilator relaxes airway muscles.

## **Popular Combinations**

Beclometasone + Levosalbutamol is itself a popular combination, generally not combined with other respiratory medications. Long-acting bronchodilators (like Formoterol) might be added to the treatment regimen by physician.

## **Precautions**
