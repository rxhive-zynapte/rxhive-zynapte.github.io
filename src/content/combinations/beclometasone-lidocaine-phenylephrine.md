## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the treatment of hemorrhoids (piles) and anal fissures. It is also used to alleviate pain and inflammation following hemorrhoid surgery and in cases of mild proctitis.  It can also be used to prepare the nasal mucosa for surgery or endoscopy.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing a corticosteroid (beclometasone), a local anesthetic (lidocaine), and a decongestant (phenylephrine).

- **Mechanism of Action:** Beclometasone reduces inflammation and itching. Lidocaine provides local pain relief by blocking nerve signals. Phenylephrine constricts blood vessels, reducing swelling and congestion.

## **Alternate Names**

No alternate names are listed in the provided sources. Brand names may vary by region.

- **Brand Names:** Proctosedyl, No Pile Cream, StayHappi Cream (and other regional variations).  A lidocaine/phenylephrine combination is marketed as *Lidocaine and Phenylephrine Topical Solution.*

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Beclometasone exerts its anti-inflammatory action by binding to glucocorticoid receptors, inhibiting inflammatory mediators. Lidocaine blocks voltage-gated sodium channels, preventing nerve impulse transmission. Phenylephrine activates alpha-adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Beclometasone is minimally absorbed systemically when applied topically. Lidocaine is absorbed through mucous membranes, with the rate dependent on application site, dosage, and duration.  Phenylephrine's absorption is limited when applied topically.

- **Mode of Action:** The combination provides synergistic relief by targeting different aspects of anorectal inflammation and pain.

- **Elimination Pathways:**  Limited information is available on the specific metabolic and elimination pathways of this combination when applied topically.  Systemically administered beclometasone is metabolized by CYP3A4.  Systemically administered phenylephrine is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO).  Systemically administered lidocaine is metabolized in the liver.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a small quantity to the affected area two to three times daily, or before and after each bowel movement. Use the provided applicator for internal hemorrhoids.

#### **Children:**

This combination is generally not recommended for children under 12 years of age. For children 12 years and older, the adult dosage may be followed. However, pediatric use should be under strict medical supervision.  One source states that this drug combination is not safe for children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are mentioned, but caution is advised due to potential age-related changes in drug metabolism.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific adjustments. Exercise caution in patients with severe renal disease.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**
