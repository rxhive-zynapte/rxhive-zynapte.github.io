## **Usage**

Beclometasone + Miconazole + Neomycin is a combination topical medication prescribed for inflammatory skin conditions complicated by bacterial and fungal infections.  These conditions include:

*   Eczema
*   Dermatitis
*   Psoriasis
*   Tinea infections (e.g., athlete's foot, ringworm, jock itch)

**Pharmacological Classifications:**

*   **Beclometasone:** Corticosteroid (anti-inflammatory)
*   **Miconazole:** Antifungal (imidazole derivative)
*   **Neomycin:** Aminoglycoside antibiotic


**Mechanism of Action:** This triple-combination medication addresses multiple aspects of skin infection. Beclometasone reduces inflammation by inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators.  Miconazole inhibits fungal growth by disrupting the synthesis of ergosterol, a crucial component of the fungal cell membrane.  Neomycin acts as an antibiotic by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis.

## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination. However, numerous brand names are used depending on the manufacturer and region. Some examples based on source information include:

*   **MYCOMIN Cream**
*   **BECLEM Ointment**
*   **BIOVIDERM**
*   **VALBET Skin Cream**

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Beclometasone exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors, reducing the production of inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins. Miconazole disrupts fungal cell membrane integrity by inhibiting ergosterol synthesis. Neomycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Topical application limits systemic absorption. Some percutaneous absorption can occur, particularly with prolonged use or application to damaged skin.  Beclometasone is metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted via the kidneys. Miconazole is partially metabolized in the liver and excreted in feces and urine. Neomycin is minimally absorbed through intact skin, primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.

**Mode of Action:** At the cellular level, Beclometasone modulates gene expression to suppress inflammatory responses. Miconazole interferes with the fungal cell membrane by inhibiting the enzyme 14-Î± demethylase, which is essential for ergosterol synthesis. Neomycin binds to the bacterial 30S ribosome, disrupting protein synthesis and leading to bacterial cell death.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer to the affected area twice daily (morning and evening). The duration of treatment varies depending on the condition and severity (typically 1-4 weeks). Do not exceed 45g of cream or 45 ml of lotion per week unless under strict medical supervision.

#### **Children:** Use in children varies based on the specific product and local guidelines. Some formulations are not recommended for children under 2 years. When used in children, courses should be limited, with a maximum of 5 days in some cases. Consult product-specific information.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Use the minimum quantity for the shortest duration necessary due to potential age-related decreases in hepatic and renal function, which may delay elimination if systemic absorption occurs.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage reduction may be required.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Close monitoring is recommended. 
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized assessment is crucial.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of this combination is generally limited to topical skin infections. It's not indicated for systemic infections requiring intravenous administration or use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU care. For emergency situations, different classes of systemic medications are appropriate.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments based on renal or hepatic impairment, metabolic disorders, or other factors should be determined on a patient-specific basis under careful medical supervision.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Burning or stinging sensation
*   Itching
*   Irritation
*   Dryness
*   Redness


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Allergic reactions (rash, swelling)
*   Skin thinning (with prolonged use)
*   Secondary infections
*   Skin discoloration
*   Ototoxicity (hearing loss with neomycin, especially with prolonged use or broken skin)


### **Long-Term Effects:** Skin atrophy and telangiectasias can occur with prolonged use of topical corticosteroids like beclometasone.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** Report any signs of allergic reactions or severe skin reactions immediately.



## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication
*   Rosacea
*   Acne
*   Perioral dermatitis
*   Primary viral or bacterial skin infections (e.g., herpes simplex, chickenpox)
*   Tuberculosis of the skin
*   Extensive burns or open wounds (increased systemic absorption risk)



## **Drug Interactions**

*   **Warfarin:** Topical or intravaginal miconazole may potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. Monitor INR closely.
*   **Other Topical Medications:** Avoid concurrent use with other topical antibiotics, antifungals, or corticosteroids unless directed by a physician.
*   **Polyene Antibiotics:** Interactions with polyene antibiotics (filipin, amphotericin B, nystatin, natamycin) may occur with clotrimazole.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be limited to situations where the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus or infant. Consult a physician before use.
