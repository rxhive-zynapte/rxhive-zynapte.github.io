## **Usage**

Beclometasone + Neomycin is a topical combination medication primarily used for inflammatory skin disorders complicated by bacterial infection.  It is prescribed for conditions like eczema, psoriasis, contact dermatitis, and otitis externa where both inflammation and bacterial presence are observed.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Beclometasone is a corticosteroid (anti-inflammatory), and Neomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Beclometasone reduces inflammation by suppressing the immune response and inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins. Neomycin exerts its antibacterial effect by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis and leading to bacterial cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Beclometasone + Neomycin" is the common generic name, variations exist.  Beclomethasone may sometimes be referred to as "Beclometason" or "Beclamethasone." Neomycin sulfate is the common salt form used.  Brand names vary depending on the region and manufacturer.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Beclometasone binds to glucocorticoid receptors in the skin, leading to decreased inflammation, itching, and redness. Neomycin disrupts bacterial protein synthesis, causing bacterial cell death.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Beclometasone, after topical application, has limited systemic absorption. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in urine and feces. Neomycin also has minimal systemic absorption through intact skin; however, absorption can be increased with damaged or inflamed skin. It is excreted primarily unchanged by the kidneys.

- **Mode of Action:** Beclometasone acts on intracellular glucocorticoid receptors, influencing gene transcription related to inflammation. Neomycin binds to specific 30S-subunit proteins and 16S rRNA of the bacteria, interfering with protein synthesis.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Beclometasone is metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and feces. Neomycin is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** A thin layer of the cream or ointment is applied to the affected area two to three times daily.

#### **Children:**  Use in children should be limited and under strict medical supervision due to higher systemic absorption potential.  The dosage and frequency should be adjusted by a pediatrician based on the child's age, weight, and the severity of the condition.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Similar to adults, with careful monitoring for skin atrophy, which may occur more readily in elderly skin.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Close monitoring of renal function is advised, especially with prolonged use or on large areas of damaged skin.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** While primarily renally excreted, hepatic function monitoring is advisable for Beclometasone.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider underlying medical conditions like diabetes or systemic infections, which may affect healing or increase susceptibility to adverse effects.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Beclometasone + Neomycin combinations are primarily for topical skin applications and not generally used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU.   Its use in emergency situations is not indicated.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are made based on patient-specific factors like age, the severity of the condition, the size of the affected area, and the presence of skin damage.  Renal and hepatic function should also be considered.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:** Burning, stinging, itching, dryness, redness, and irritation at the application site.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:** Allergic contact dermatitis, skin atrophy (thinning), telangiectasia (spider veins), hypopigmentation (lightening of the skin), hypertrichosis (increased hair growth), secondary infections, and systemic effects of corticosteroids with prolonged use or use over large areas. Neomycin can rarely cause ototoxicity (hearing loss) and nephrotoxicity (kidney damage), particularly with systemic absorption.


### **Long-Term Effects:** Skin atrophy, striae (stretch marks), telangiectasia, and hypopigmentation.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Severe allergic reactions, skin rash, swelling, and systemic absorption of corticosteroids.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to either Beclometasone or Neomycin. Viral skin infections (e.g., herpes simplex, varicella), fungal skin infections (unless specifically indicated in combination formulations), tuberculosis or syphilis of the skin, acne rosacea, perioral dermatitis, and open wounds or lesions.

## **Drug Interactions**

Systemic aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin, streptomycin) increase the risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.  Other topical corticosteroids can potentiate local and systemic side effects. Immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine) may enhance immunosuppressive effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be under strict medical supervision and only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.  Neomycin has ototoxic potential in animal studies, posing a theoretical risk to fetal hearing.  Limited human data exists regarding the safety of Beclometasone during pregnancy.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Beclometasone: Anti-inflammatory corticosteroid; Neomycin: Aminoglycoside antibiotic.

- **Side Effects:** Burning, itching, irritation, skin thinning, allergic reactions.

- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, viral/fungal skin infections, acne, open wounds.

- **Drug Interactions:** Systemic aminoglycosides, other topical corticosteroids, immunosuppressants.

- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; potential risks to the fetus.

- **Dosage:** Apply thinly 2-3 times daily.

- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Renal function (if prolonged use), skin reactions.


## **Popular Combinations**

Beclometasone and Neomycin are sometimes combined with clotrimazole (antifungal) or lidocaine (local anesthetic) for broader coverage against mixed infections or to alleviate pain.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess for allergies, skin integrity, and concomitant medications. Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes.

- **Specific Populations:**  Pregnant/breastfeeding women should use under medical supervision.  Pediatric use requires careful dose adjustments and monitoring.

- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid tight bandages over treated area unless specifically directed.
