## **Usage**

Beclometasone + Salbutamol is prescribed for the maintenance treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in patients where the use of a combination product is appropriate.  It is not intended for relieving acute asthma attacks.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* **Beclometasone:** Corticosteroid, Anti-inflammatory
* **Salbutamol:**  β₂-adrenergic agonist, Bronchodilator

**Mechanism of Action:** Beclometasone reduces airway inflammation, while Salbutamol relaxes the bronchial smooth muscles, widening the airways.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Beclometasone + Salbutamol" is the generic name, the combination is marketed under various brand names, including *Ibicar S*. Regional variations in nomenclature might exist.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Beclometasone exerts its anti-inflammatory action by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm of airway cells.  This complex translocates to the cell nucleus, modulating gene transcription and ultimately decreasing the production of inflammatory mediators. Salbutamol, a short-acting β₂-agonist, relaxes bronchial smooth muscles by stimulating β₂-adrenergic receptors, leading to bronchodilation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Following inhalation, both drugs are absorbed systemically to varying extents. Beclometasone is metabolized primarily in the liver via CYP3A4 enzymes, whereas Salbutamol is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine.

**Elimination Pathways:**

* Beclometasone: Primarily hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion.
* Salbutamol: Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard dose is two inhalations (puffs) two to four times daily. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 12 inhalations. The dose is titrated according to the individual patient's response and the severity of their condition.

#### **Children (6 years and above):**

One to two inhalations twice daily or as directed by the physician. The maximum daily dose generally should not exceed eight inhalations. Adult supervision is recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient needs and response to therapy.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution should be exercised in patients with renal impairment. Dose adjustments may be required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution should be exercised in patients with hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Pre-existing conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, hyperthyroidism, and hypokalemia warrant careful consideration.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Beclometasone + Salbutamol is not indicated for acute management in settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its role is in the long-term control of asthma and COPD.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments should be individualized based on patient response, disease severity, and the presence of renal or hepatic impairment. Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism may also necessitate dosage modifications.

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

* Oral candidiasis (thrush)
* Hoarseness
* Throat irritation
* Headache
* Tremor
* Cough
* Palpitations
* Tachycardia

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Paradoxical bronchospasm
* Allergic reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema)
* Adrenal suppression (with prolonged high doses)
* Hypokalemia

### **Long-Term Effects**

* Reduced bone mineral density (with high doses)
* Growth retardation in children (with high doses)


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, paradoxical bronchospasm, and significant hypokalemia require immediate medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to beclometasone, salbutamol, or any other component of the formulation.
* Untreated respiratory infections.

## **Drug Interactions**

* β-blockers (may antagonize the bronchodilator effects of salbutamol)
* Diuretics (may potentiate hypokalemia)
* Xanthine derivatives (may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias)
* Tricyclic antidepressants (may enhance the cardiovascular effects of salbutamol)
* Some general anesthetics

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

This combination should be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Beclometasone:  Anti-inflammatory (corticosteroid); Salbutamol: Bronchodilator (β₂-agonist).
* **Side Effects:**  Oral thrush, hoarseness, tremor, headache, palpitations.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, untreated respiratory infections.
* **Drug Interactions:** β-blockers, diuretics, xanthines, tricyclic antidepressants.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 2 inhalations 2-4 times daily (max 12 inhalations/day); Children (6+ years): 1-2 inhalations twice daily (max 8 inhalations/day).
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Lung function tests (e.g., FEV1, peak flow), serum potassium levels, growth in children.

## **Popular Combinations**

Beclometasone + Salbutamol is itself a popular combination for managing asthma and COPD.

## **Precautions**

Assess patients for allergies, comorbidities, and potential drug interactions before initiating therapy. Monitor for side effects and adjust the dosage accordingly. Counsel patients on proper inhaler technique. Advise patients to rinse their mouths after each inhalation to minimize the risk of oral thrush.
