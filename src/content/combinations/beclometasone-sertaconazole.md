## **Usage**

Beclometasone + Sertaconazole is prescribed for the topical treatment of fungal skin infections, especially those accompanied by inflammatory skin conditions like eczema.  It is classified as a combination corticosteroid (Beclometasone) and antifungal (Sertaconazole) medication.

The Beclometasone component reduces inflammation by suppressing the release of chemical messengers that cause redness, itching, and swelling.  Sertaconazole exerts its antifungal effect by targeting the fungal cell membrane, disrupting its integrity, which eventually leads to the death of the fungal cells.

## **Alternate Names**

While the generic name is Beclometasone + Sertaconazole, several brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region. Some examples include Onabet-B, Sertacide-B,  Sertacream-B, Afserta-B, and Monoguard-B.  There might be other international or regional variations as well.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Sertaconazole acts by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol, a crucial component of the fungal cell membrane. This disruption leads to increased membrane permeability and ultimately fungal cell death.  Beclometasone, a glucocorticoid, binds to glucocorticoid receptors in the skin cells.  This binding inhibits inflammatory pathways, reducing the production of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins, thereby alleviating symptoms such as redness, itching, and swelling.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Topical application minimizes systemic absorption of both drugs.  The extent of percutaneous absorption depends on factors such as skin integrity, the area treated, and the use of occlusive dressings.

**Mode of Action:** Sertaconazole's antifungal activity stems from its ability to inhibit the enzyme lanosterol 14Î±-demethylase, responsible for ergosterol biosynthesis in fungi.  Beclometasone exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by modulating the transcription of inflammatory genes.

**Elimination Pathways:** Both drugs undergo hepatic metabolism and are primarily excreted via bile and urine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer of the cream to the affected area and surrounding skin twice daily for 2-4 weeks.  The duration of treatment depends on the severity and location of the infection.


#### **Children:**  Use in children under 12 years of age is generally not recommended due to the potential for systemic absorption of Beclometasone and the risk of HPA axis suppression with prolonged use.  If use is considered essential, it should be under strict medical supervision and for the shortest duration possible.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are generally required, but close monitoring for local and systemic side effects is advised.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Topical application minimizes systemic effects. However, caution is advised, and clinical monitoring is necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** As with renal impairment, topical application limits systemic exposure. However, careful observation for any adverse effects is essential.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** In patients with diabetes, blood glucose levels should be monitored closely, as topical corticosteroids can affect glucose metabolism.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The primary use of Beclometasone + Sertaconazole is for topical dermatological applications.  It is not indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be needed based on factors like the severity of the infection, the patient's response to treatment, and the presence of any complicating factors.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Itching or burning at the application site
* Dryness
* Redness

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic contact dermatitis (rash, hives, swelling)
* Skin atrophy (thinning)
* Telangiectasia (spider veins)
* Hypopigmentation (skin lightening)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Prolonged use, especially at high doses or under occlusion, can lead to systemic absorption of Beclometasone, potentially resulting in HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and other systemic corticosteroid effects.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Severe allergic reactions, signs of skin infection spreading or worsening, or any unusual skin reactions require prompt medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to Beclometasone, Sertaconazole, or any component of the formulation
* Viral skin infections (herpes simplex, varicella zoster, etc.)
* Rosacea
* Acne
* Open wounds or broken skin
* Tuberculosis (TB) of the skin
* Vaccinia

## **Drug Interactions**

* **CYP450 Interactions:** Beclometasone is metabolized by CYP3A4. Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) may increase the risk of systemic side effects.
* **Other Interactions:**  Potential interactions with certain HIV medications (e.g., cobicistat) and some antifungals have been reported.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Topical application minimizes systemic absorption; however, safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been definitively established.  Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus or nursing infant.  Consult a physician for guidance.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Sertaconazole: Inhibits ergosterol synthesis, disrupting fungal cell membranes.  Beclometasone: Binds to glucocorticoid receptors, suppressing inflammation.
* **Side Effects:** Common: itching, burning, dryness. Serious: allergic reactions, skin infections.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, viral skin infections, rosacea, acne, open wounds.
* **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors, some HIV and antifungal medications.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks. Consult a physician.
* **Dosage:** Topical, twice daily for 2-4 weeks.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Skin irritation, signs of infection, allergic reactions.  Long-term use: monitor for systemic effects.

## **Popular Combinations**

This product is itself a combination of Beclometasone and Sertaconazole.  It is sometimes prescribed along with oral antifungals for severe or persistent infections.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Avoid contact with eyes, nose, and mouth. Do not use on broken skin.  Wash hands after application.
* **Specific Populations:** Consult with a physician regarding use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
