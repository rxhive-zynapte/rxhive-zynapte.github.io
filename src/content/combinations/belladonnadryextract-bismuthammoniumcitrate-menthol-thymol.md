## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily used to treat gastrointestinal discomfort. It is classified as a gastrointestinal agent with anticholinergic, antacid, antiseptic, and carminative properties.

It's prescribed for:

* Hyperacidity
* Indigestion
* Gastric ulcers
* Diarrhea
* Flatulence
* Nausea
* Upset stomach
* Belching
* Dysentery

## **Alternate Names**

* Stomach Fit
* Stomafit
* Gastoma


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Belladonna dry extract:** Exerts anticholinergic effects, reducing stomach acid secretion and gut motility.  This helps control hyperacidity, spasms, and pain.
* **Bismuth Ammonium Citrate:** Acts as an antacid, neutralizing stomach acid and forming a protective layer over the stomach lining. It also exhibits some antibacterial properties against *H. pylori*.
* **Menthol:** Provides a soothing effect on the stomach lining and relaxes intestinal muscles, easing discomfort and aiding digestion.  It also has mild analgesic and carminative properties.
* **Thymol:** Acts as a carminative, aiding in relieving gas and promoting digestion. It also possesses antiseptic and antibacterial properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

The pharmacokinetics of this combination product are not well-defined as a whole.  Information about individual components is as follows:

* **Belladonna dry extract:** Atropine, the primary active component, is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine.
* **Bismuth Ammonium Citrate:**  Poorly absorbed from the GI tract. Most is excreted in the feces, causing darkening of the stool. A small amount is absorbed and excreted renally.
* **Menthol and Thymol:**  Absorption, metabolism, and excretion details for these components in this specific formulation are not readily available. Generally, these compounds are readily absorbed and metabolized in the liver.

**Mechanism of Action:**

* **Belladonna dry extract (Atropine):** Competitively antagonizes muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, inhibiting parasympathetic activity. This leads to decreased gastric acid secretion, reduced gut motility, and decreased spasms.
* **Bismuth Ammonium Citrate:** Neutralizes gastric acid through chemical reaction. It also may inhibit the activity of *H. pylori*.
* **Menthol:** Stimulates cold-sensitive TRPM8 receptors, producing a cooling sensation and relaxing smooth muscles in the GI tract.
* **Thymol:** Its carminative action is thought to be related to its ability to stimulate gastrointestinal motility and reduce gas formation.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

5-10 ml (1-2 teaspoons) taken orally three times daily after meals with half a cup of water.

#### **Children:**

Use in children under 12 is generally not recommended. Some sources suggest use in children older than 6, but clear dosing guidelines are lacking. Pediatric use should be under strict physician supervision.

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary. Consult a physician.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dosage adjustments may be required. Consult a physician.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dosage adjustments may be required. Consult a physician.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consult a physician for personalized recommendations, especially for patients with glaucoma, heart disease, myasthenia gravis, bleeding problems, or gout.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage for specific clinical situations (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations) is not established for this combination. It is primarily used for gastrointestinal discomfort management, not acute/critical care.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be needed based on patient response and tolerance. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment require careful monitoring and potential dosage adjustments by a physician.
