## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as a dietary supplement to address nutritional deficiencies. It may be prescribed for conditions like diabetic neuropathy, carnitine deficiency, or pyridoxine deficiency.  It supports overall health and wellness by improving nerve function and energy production. It is not classified under a single pharmacological class but acts as a nutritional supplement.

## **Alternate Names**

* Coenzyme Q10 + Pyridoxine + Levocarnitine + Resveratrol + Benfotiamine
* CoQ10 + Vitamin B6 + L-carnitine + Resveratrol + Benfotiamine
* Agenon (brand name)
* Ageless Tablet
* Aisa Tablet

## **How It Works**

This combination works synergistically through its individual components:

* **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10):**  This is an antioxidant that plays a crucial role in mitochondrial electron transport chain, thereby promoting energy production.  It also improves blood pressure and vascular function.

* **Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine):** This is essential for brain function, nerve health, and red blood cell production. It is also involved in protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism.

* **Levo-carnitine:** This facilitates fatty acid transport into the mitochondria for energy production and can improve heart function and reduce fatigue.

* **Resveratrol:**  This potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent protects against cellular damage and reduces inflammation.

* **Benfotiamine:** A fat-soluble form of vitamin B1 (thiamine), benfotiamine improves nerve function, and reduces symptoms of diabetic neuropathy, and supports energy production.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The pharmacokinetics of this combination haven't been specifically studied. However, the individual components have distinct pharmacokinetic profiles: CoQ10 is absorbed from the gut and transported via lipoproteins, while vitamin B6 is readily absorbed and metabolized in the liver. Levocarnitine is absorbed in the small intestine, and resveratrol undergoes rapid metabolism in the liver. Benfotiamine exhibits better bioavailability than thiamine and is converted into thiamine pyrophosphate. Elimination pathways for each component vary (renal/hepatic excretion, metabolism by CYP enzymes).


## **Dosage**

Dosage varies depending on individual patient needs and product formulation. Consult product packaging or a healthcare professional for precise instructions.
