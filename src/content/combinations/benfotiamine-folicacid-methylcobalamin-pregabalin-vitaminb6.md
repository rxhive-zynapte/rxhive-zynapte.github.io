## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the management of *neuropathic pain*, a type of chronic pain caused by nerve damage or dysfunction. Examples of conditions causing neuropathic pain include diabetic neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia (nerve pain following shingles), and spinal cord injury.  It may also be used for nerve pain resulting from vitamin B deficiencies.

This drug's pharmacological classifications include:
* **Analgesic:** Pregabalin component for pain relief
* **Anticonvulsant:** Pregabalin component for seizure control (although this combination is not typically used as a primary anticonvulsant)
* **Nutritional Supplement:** Vitamin B components (Benfotiamine, Folic Acid, Methylcobalamin, Vitamin B6) supporting nerve health.

The mechanism of action involves multiple pathways: Pregabalin modulates calcium channels in nerve cells, reducing the release of neurotransmitters associated with pain signals. B vitamins support nerve function and myelin production, facilitating nerve regeneration and protection.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no single international nonproprietary name (INN) for this combination. It's often referred to by its constituent components.  Brand names vary regionally; some examples include Neurofast, Nervijen, Nervijen-P, Upcyte-P, Pedwin, Meganeuron PG, and Pregamer Plus.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Pregabalin:** Binds to the alpha-2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system, decreasing the release of neurotransmitters like glutamate, noradrenaline, and substance P, reducing neuronal excitability and pain signal transmission.
* **B Vitamins:** Benfotiamine, a fat-soluble form of thiamine (B1), enhances transketolase activity, a crucial enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, protecting nerves from glucose toxicity. Methylcobalamin (B12) and pyridoxine (B6) are involved in myelin synthesis and nerve regeneration. Folic acid (B9) is essential for DNA synthesis and cell division, supporting nerve cell function.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Pregabalin:**  Rapidly absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1 hour.  It is minimally metabolized and primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. The half-life is approximately 6 hours.
* **B Vitamins:** These are water-soluble and absorbed variably in the gastrointestinal tract.  They undergo metabolic conversion in the liver and are excreted primarily in the urine.

**Elimination Pathways:** Pregabalin is mainly excreted renally. B vitamins are primarily eliminated renally, with some metabolic conversion in the liver.


## **Dosage**

Dosage is determined by the physician based on individual patient needs and response.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Typical dosages may involve pregabalin 75-150 mg twice daily, combined with varying doses of B vitamins depending on the specific formulation. 

#### **Children:**  Safety and efficacy have not been established in children below 12 years of age. Dosage adjustments are needed in children based on weight, age and medical condition.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary due to age-related decline in renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Pregabalin dosage must be reduced based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution advised in patients with severe liver disease, and dosage adjustments may be required for pregabalin.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Careful evaluation is necessary for patients with heart problems, chronic pulmonary insufficiency, suicidal tendencies, or a history of substance abuse.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosage for this combination drug is not typically modified for specific medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  In these cases, pain management is individualized based on the patient's condition and usually involves different medications tailored to acute needs.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are essential for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  Dosage adjustments are made for pregabalin based on creatinine clearance (renal) and liver function tests (hepatic).



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Dizziness, drowsiness, tiredness, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, dry mouth, peripheral edema, weight gain, difficulty concentrating.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, bronchospasm), angioedema, suicidal thoughts, changes in mental status.


### **Long-Term Effects**

Weight gain, peripheral edema, cognitive impairment (with prolonged pregabalin use), potential for dependence with pregabalin.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Angioedema, anaphylaxis, suicidal ideation, severe CNS depression (with concomitant use of CNS depressants).


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication.


## **Drug Interactions**

Pregabalin may interact with other CNS depressants (alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines, antihistamines), enhancing their sedative effects.  It can also interact with certain anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin, phenobarbital).  Antacids might reduce pregabalin absorption. B vitamins, especially folic acid, may interfere with some medications, including certain antibiotics and anticonvulsants.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregabalin is categorized as Pregnancy Category C (animal studies have shown adverse effects, human data limited). Use during pregnancy should be considered only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus.   B vitamins are generally considered safe during pregnancy and lactation, but high doses should be avoided.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Pregabalin modulates calcium channels, reducing neuronal excitability. B vitamins support nerve function, myelin production, and nerve regeneration.
* **Side Effects:** Dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, peripheral edema, weight gain.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:** CNS depressants, anticonvulsants, antacids.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Pregabalin-use with caution.  B vitamins-generally safe.
* **Dosage:** Varies based on individual needs and renal function.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Pain levels, neurological function, renal function, blood glucose (in diabetics), mood changes.


## **Popular Combinations**

This combination itself represents a popular therapeutic approach for neuropathic pain, combining pharmacological pain control with nutritional nerve support.  Other drugs like Alpha Lipoic Acid are sometimes added to this combination in some formulations.



## **Precautions**

*Renal and hepatic function must be assessed before starting treatment. *Patients should be monitored for mood changes and suicidal ideation, especially those with a history of depression. *Alcohol should be avoided due to additive CNS depressant effects. * Caution should be exercised in patients with chronic pulmonary insufficiency.
