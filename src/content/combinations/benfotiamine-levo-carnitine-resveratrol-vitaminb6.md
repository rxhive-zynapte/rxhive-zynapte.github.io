## **Usage**

- This combination is primarily prescribed as a dietary supplement to address nutritional deficiencies, particularly those related to thiamine (vitamin B1), carnitine, and vitamin B6. It may also be used to support nerve health and improve energy levels.  Conditions it may be used for include carnitine deficiency, pyridoxine deficiency, and diabetic neuropathy. It can also be used as an adjunctive treatment for conditions such as high cholesterol, heart disease, and cancer.
- **Pharmacological Classification**: This combination is classified as a nutritional supplement.  It does not fall under a single drug class like antibiotics or analgesics.  Each component has its own pharmacological classification. Benfotiamine is a vitamin, Levo-carnitine is classified under amino acids, Resveratrol is an antioxidant, and Vitamin B6 is a vitamin.
- **Mechanism of Action**: This combination works by replenishing essential nutrients and supporting various metabolic processes. Benfotiamine, a fat-soluble form of vitamin B1, improves thiamine uptake and utilization, supporting nerve function. Levo-carnitine facilitates fatty acid transport into mitochondria, enhancing energy production.  Resveratrol acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage and potentially reducing inflammation. Vitamin B6 is essential for various metabolic processes, including nerve function and red blood cell formation.

## **Alternate Names**

- This combination is commonly referred to by the names of its individual components. This combination does not have other international non-proprietary names (INNs). 
- **Brand Names**:  Ageless, Aisa, Agenon.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**:  Benfotiamine improves nerve function by increasing thiamine levels in nerve tissues.  Levo-carnitine improves energy production by facilitating fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria.  Resveratrol exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Vitamin B6 is a cofactor for various enzymes involved in metabolism.
- **Pharmacokinetics**:
    - *Absorption*: Benfotiamine is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  Levo-carnitine is absorbed primarily in the small intestine. Resveratrol absorption occurs mainly in the small intestine. Vitamin B6 is readily absorbed in the jejunum.
    - *Metabolism*: Benfotiamine is converted to thiamine. Levo-carnitine is not extensively metabolized, Vitamin B6 is mainly metabolized in the liver and is excreted through kidneys. Resveratrol is quickly metabolized and has very low bioavailability.
    - *Elimination*:  Thiamine and its metabolites are primarily excreted in urine. Levo-carnitine is mainly eliminated by the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action**: Benfotiamine enhances transketolase activity, a key enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, thus protecting against the damaging effects of advanced glycation end products (AGEs).  Levo-carnitine transports long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for beta-oxidation, generating ATP.  Resveratrol activates sirtuins, proteins involved in cellular health and longevity.  Vitamin B6 acts as a coenzyme in various metabolic pathways.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, Neurotransmitter Modulation**:  No specific receptor binding or neurotransmitter modulation has been described for this combination.  Benfotiamine indirectly inhibits the formation of AGEs.  Levo-carnitine interacts with carnitine acyltransferases.
- **Elimination Pathways**: Primarily renal excretion for all components.
