## **Usage**

- This combination is prescribed for the treatment and prevention of vitamin B1, B6, and B12 deficiencies, particularly in conditions like diabetic neuropathy and peripheral neuropathy, aiming to improve nerve function and reduce symptoms such as tingling, numbness, and pain.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Nutritional Supplement, Vitamin Combination.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination works synergistically to support nerve health. Benfotiamine, a fat-soluble form of thiamine (B1), enhances carbohydrate metabolism in nerve cells, reducing the accumulation of harmful metabolites. Methylcobalamin (B12) is crucial for myelin synthesis and nerve regeneration. Pyridoxine (B6) contributes to the synthesis of neurotransmitters essential for nerve function.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination.  Variations may occur based on the specific brand or manufacturer.
- **Brand Names:** Numerous brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region.  A few examples have been mentioned in available sources, but a comprehensive list is not readily available.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Benfotiamine improves transketolase activity, an enzyme vital for glucose metabolism. Methylcobalamin participates in methylation reactions and DNA synthesis, supporting nerve cell growth and function. Pyridoxine plays a role in the synthesis of neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and GABA.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Benfotiamine demonstrates better absorption and bioavailability than thiamine hydrochloride. Methylcobalamin is absorbed via passive diffusion and active transport. Pyridoxine is readily absorbed in the small intestine. All three components are metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily by the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:** Benfotiamine reduces the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which contribute to nerve damage in diabetes. Methylcobalamin supports myelin sheath formation and nerve regeneration. Pyridoxine facilitates neurotransmitter synthesis.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** The combination does not involve direct receptor binding or enzyme inhibition. However, it influences neurotransmitter synthesis and nerve cell metabolism.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

Dosage guidelines are not explicitly defined in available sources. The dose varies based on individual needs, the severity of the deficiency, and the specific product formulation. Consulting a physician is crucial for determining the appropriate dose.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

#### **Children:**

- Limited information regarding pediatric dosing is available. Consult a physician for guidance. Pediatric safety has not been firmly established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- Information on dose adjustments based on age, renal or hepatic impairment, or comorbid conditions is not specified in current sources. Consultation with a physician is necessary.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- The provided sources do not contain dosage recommendations for these specific medical settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dosage modifications are based on patient-specific factors, including renal/hepatic function and other medical conditions. Always consult a doctor for personalized recommendations.
