## **Usage**

- Benserazide + Levodopa is prescribed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and Parkinson-like syndromes. It helps manage symptoms like tremors, stiffness, slow movement, and difficulty with balance and coordination.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Dopamine precursor/peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor combination.
- **Mechanism of action:** Levodopa is a precursor to dopamine, crossing the blood-brain barrier and converting into dopamine within the central nervous system (CNS). This increase in dopamine levels helps alleviate Parkinsonian symptoms resulting from dopamine deficiency. Benserazide is a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor that prevents levodopa from being converted to dopamine outside the CNS, minimizing peripheral side effects and increasing levodopa availability to the brain.

## **Alternate Names**

- Levodopa/Benserazide
- **Brand Names:** Madopar, Prolopa (and various generics)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Levodopa replenishes depleted dopamine in the brain, improving motor function. Benserazide acts peripherally, preventing the conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the CNS. This reduces side effects like nausea and vomiting, and allows a lower dose of levodopa to be used.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Levodopa is readily absorbed from the small intestine. Benserazide does not cross the blood-brain barrier.  Levodopa is metabolized both peripherally and centrally. Peripheral metabolism involves decarboxylation to dopamine (inhibited by benserazide) and O-methylation to 3-O-methyldopa. Central metabolism occurs primarily via decarboxylation to dopamine. Levodopa and its metabolites are primarily excreted renally.
- **Mode of action:** Levodopa acts as a dopamine replacement in the striatum of the brain. Benserazide doesn't have a direct effect on Parkinsonian symptoms.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Levodopa indirectly acts as a dopamine receptor agonist after conversion to dopamine. Benserazide inhibits dopa decarboxylase peripherally.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: 50 mg levodopa/12.5 mg benserazide three times daily.
- Dose titration: Increased slowly by 50-100 mg levodopa/12.5-25 mg benserazide daily or every other day, adjusted according to the patient's response.
- Maintenance dose: 400-800 mg levodopa/100-200 mg benserazide daily, divided into 3 or more doses.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for use in patients under 25 years of age as skeletal development must be complete.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and titrate cautiously.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary. Close monitoring is recommended.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dose adjustment may be necessary. Close monitoring is recommended.
