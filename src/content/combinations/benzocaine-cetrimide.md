## **Usage**

Benzocaine + Cetrimide is a topical medication primarily used for the treatment of minor burns, scrapes, cuts, insect bites, and skin infections. It provides temporary relief from pain and itching associated with these conditions.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Benzocaine: Local anesthetic
* Cetrimide: Antiseptic, disinfectant

**Mechanism of Action:**

Benzocaine acts as a local anesthetic by reversibly binding to sodium channels on nerve membranes, blocking nerve impulse transmission and reducing pain sensation. Cetrimide is a quaternary ammonium compound that acts as an antiseptic by disrupting bacterial cell membranes, leading to cell death. It is effective against a broad range of bacteria, fungi, and some viruses.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is typically referred to as Benzocaine + Cetrimide. There isn't a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN) for this specific drug combination. Brand names include Healex Plus.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

Benzocaine exerts its local anesthetic effect by preventing the generation and conduction of nerve impulses. This leads to a localized loss of sensation, including pain. Cetrimide's antiseptic action is due to its ability to disrupt the cell membranes of microorganisms. This causes leakage of cellular contents and ultimately leads to microbial death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* Absorption: When applied topically, benzocaine is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation. Cetrimide also has limited systemic absorption following topical application.

* Metabolism:  Benzocaine is metabolized primarily in the plasma and liver. Cetrimide's metabolism is not well characterized.

* Elimination: Benzocaine's metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine. Cetrimide is primarily eliminated unchanged in the urine and feces.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a thin layer to the affected area as needed, typically up to 4 times per day. The dosage may vary depending on the product formulation and the severity of the condition.

#### **Children:**

Use with caution in children under 2 years of age. Consult a physician for appropriate dosing and safety considerations.  Avoid application to large areas of broken skin or mucous membranes in children. Not enough information is available on whether Benzocaine+cetrimide is safe for use in children below 12 years of age. Please consult your physician.



#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to the potential for increased systemic absorption.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustment is typically required but caution is advised.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustment is typically required, but caution is advised.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Contraindicated in patients with methemoglobinemia. Use with caution in patients with G6PD deficiency or other blood disorders.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Benzocaine + Cetrimide is generally not indicated for use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU. Its primary use is restricted to minor skin ailments.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are typically not necessary based on renal or hepatic function. However, exercise caution in patients with these conditions.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Application site reactions (e.g., burning, stinging, redness, itching, rash).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Methemoglobinemia (a serious blood disorder), allergic reactions (e.g., angioedema).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

No significant long-term adverse effects have been reported with topical use as directed.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Methemoglobinemia, severe allergic reactions.




## **Contraindications**

* Known hypersensitivity to benzocaine, cetrimide, or any component of the formulation.
* Methemoglobinemia.
* Large areas of broken skin or mucous membranes, especially in children.

## **Drug Interactions**

No clinically significant drug interactions have been specifically reported with topical Benzocaine + Cetrimide.  However, be mindful of potential additive effects if used with other topical anesthetics.  As cetrimide is an antiseptic, avoid concurrent use with other antiseptics on the same area.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult a doctor before using during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Safety data during these periods are limited.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Benzocaine blocks nerve impulses; cetrimide disrupts bacterial cell membranes.
