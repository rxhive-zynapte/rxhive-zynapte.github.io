## **Usage**

- This drug combination is prescribed for impacted earwax (cerumen) and keratosis obturans (a rare condition where the ear canal is blocked with a keratin plug).
- Pharmacological classification: Cerumenolytic, local anesthetic, antiseptic, and counterirritant.
- Mechanism of Action: The combined effect of paradichlorobenzene (cerumenolytic), benzocaine (local anesthetic), and chlorbutol (antiseptic and mild local anesthetic) softens earwax, reduces pain and discomfort, and provides mild antisepsis.
