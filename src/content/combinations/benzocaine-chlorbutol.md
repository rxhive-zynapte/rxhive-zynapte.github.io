## **Usage**

Benzocaine + Chlorbutol ear drops are primarily prescribed for impacted earwax (cerumen) and keratosis obturans (accumulation of keratin debris in the ear canal).  It's classified as an otic agent.  More specifically, it combines a local anesthetic (benzocaine), antiseptic (chlorbutol), and cerumenolytics (paradichlorobenzene and turpentine oil) to soften earwax, reduce pain, and prevent infection.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is often referred to as Benzocaine and Chlorbutol Ear Drops or Paradichlorobenzene + Benzocaine + Chlorbutol + Turpentine Oil Ear Drops. Some brand names include Otiflox WX, EDVAAR W, Ceruklin, and Audisol.  A/B Otic drops are also sometimes used, although they refer to only Antipyrine and Benzocaine without the Chlorbutol. Many other brand names exist.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Benzocaine:**  A local anesthetic that blocks voltage-gated sodium channels in nerve membranes, inhibiting nerve impulse transmission and reducing pain sensation.
* **Chlorbutol:**  Acts as a preservative with mild antiseptic and local anesthetic properties.
* **Paradichlorobenzene:**  Softens and dissolves earwax by disrupting its structure.
* **Turpentine Oil:**  Acts as a solvent and lubricant, facilitating wax removal. It may also have anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Primarily topical action within the ear canal. Systemic absorption is minimal, but individual ingredients undergo different metabolic and excretion pathways.

**Mechanism of Action:** Each drug in the formulation works by itself. There is no synergistic effect, there are independent effects at the site of topical application.

**Elimination Pathways:** Since systemic absorption is limited, excretion primarily occurs through the ear canal as softened earwax. Systemic routes such as urine and feces are not primary routes of elimination.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 2-3 drops into the affected ear, 2-3 times daily. Treatment duration varies depending on the severity of impaction.

#### **Children:**  Use in children under 12, and especially under 1 year old, is generally not recommended without consulting a healthcare professional. If used in children, please use under close medical supervision. Use in infants and small children should not happen without a consultation with a qualified physician.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with hearing problems, intestinal problems, kidney problems, myasthenia gravis, and Parkinson's disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The primary clinical use is for impacted earwax and keratosis obturans.  It is not typically used for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are generally not required, but caution is advised in patients with pre-existing conditions, especially those affecting the ear, kidney, or liver.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Temporary stinging or burning sensation in the ear
* Itching or redness in or around the ear
* Unpleasant taste in the mouth (if the drops flow into the mouth)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis: wheezing, fast heart rate, clammy skin, light-headedness, breathing difficulties)
* Methemoglobinemia (rare but serious blood disorder)
* Angioedema (swelling beneath the skin)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

No significant long-term effects are expected with short-term use.  Prolonged use may increase the risk of local irritation or sensitization.



## **Contraindications**

* Known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients (benzocaine, chlorbutol, paradichlorobenzene, or turpentine oil)
* Perforated eardrum
* Inflamed ear canal
* Eczema on the outer ear

## **Drug Interactions**

No specific drug interactions have been noted.  However, always inform your doctor about all medications you are taking to prevent any potential interactions.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
