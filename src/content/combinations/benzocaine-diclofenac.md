## **Usage**

Benzocaine + Diclofenac is prescribed for the short-term relief of pain associated with minor oral irritations such as mouth sores, sore throat, and teething pain.  Benzocaine acts as a local anesthetic, while Diclofenac provides anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects.

Its pharmacological classifications include:

* **Local Anesthetic:** (Benzocaine)
* **Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID):** (Diclofenac)
* **Analgesic:** (Diclofenac)

**Mechanism of Action:** Benzocaine reversibly binds to sodium channels on neuronal cell membranes, blocking nerve impulse transmission, leading to a localized anesthetic effect.  Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, primarily COX-2, which are responsible for the production of prostaglandins, substances that mediate inflammation and pain.  This leads to a reduction in inflammation and pain at the application site.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no officially recognized alternate name for the combination product. Individual components are known by the following:

* **Benzocaine:** Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate
* **Diclofenac:**  [2-(2,6-Dichlorophenyl)amino]benzeneacetic acid

Brand names vary depending on the formulation and region. Some examples for products containing Benzocaine or Diclofenac include Anbesol, Orajel, Voltaren, and Cataflam. However, a combined brand name is typically found on the commercially available product in the region it is sold.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Benzocaine acts locally by inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels in nerve membranes, leading to a loss of sensation at the site of application.  Diclofenac exerts its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects through the inhibition of COX enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis.

**Pharmacokinetics:** When applied topically to mucous membranes, benzocaine is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation and metabolized primarily by plasma esterases.  Diclofenac, when applied topically, is absorbed to some extent, with the majority undergoing hepatic metabolism (primarily by CYP2C9) and subsequent renal excretion.

**Mode of Action:**
* **Benzocaine:**  Blocks voltage-gated sodium channels on sensory neurons, preventing depolarization and subsequent nerve impulse transmission.
* **Diclofenac:** Inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, leading to a reduction in prostaglandin production.  Diclofenac preferentially inhibits COX-2, thereby exhibiting anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects.

**Elimination Pathways:**
* **Benzocaine:** Primarily metabolized by plasma cholinesterases. Metabolites are excreted in the urine.
* **Diclofenac:** Hepatic metabolism (primarily through CYP2C9) followed by renal excretion of metabolites (mainly as glucuronide conjugates).


## **Dosage**

Dosage depends on the specific product formulation (gel, spray, lozenge, etc.) and the individual patient.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  As directed on product packaging. Usually, a small amount of gel or spray is applied to the affected area every few hours as needed.

#### **Children:**  Use in children, especially those under 2 years of age, should be done with caution and under the guidance of a healthcare professional, due to the risk of methemoglobinemia associated with benzocaine. Dosage needs to be adjusted according to the product and age.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution and at the lowest effective dose due to potential age-related decline in hepatic and renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution and monitor renal function. Dose adjustment might be needed.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution and monitor liver function. Dose adjustment might be needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration should be given to patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, G6PD deficiency, or methemoglobinemia.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Topical benzocaine-diclofenac combinations are not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU. Their use is primarily restricted to symptomatic relief of minor oral pain.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, based on the degree of dysfunction. Always refer to the specific product labeling for guidance.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Local irritation, burning, or stinging at the application site.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* **Methemoglobinemia:** (especially with benzocaine in infants or those with G6PD deficiency)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic complications are rare with topical use, but prolonged or excessive use could potentially increase the risk of systemic adverse effects related to diclofenac, such as gastrointestinal issues or renal dysfunction.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Methemoglobinemia requires immediate medical attention. Allergic reactions should be promptly addressed.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to benzocaine, diclofenac, or any component of the formulation.
* Known history of methemoglobinemia.
* G6PD deficiency (with benzocaine).
* Third trimester of pregnancy (diclofenac).
* In the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Diclofenac:** May interact with other NSAIDs, anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), lithium, methotrexate, cyclosporine, and some antihypertensives.
* **Benzocaine:** May interact with medications that can induce methemoglobinemia (e.g., sulfonamides, nitrates).

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Diclofenac should be avoided during the third trimester due to the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.  Benzocaine use should be limited and only when the potential benefit outweighs the risk.
* **Breastfeeding:** While topical application minimizes risk, avoid applying to the nipple or breast area.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Benzocaine blocks sodium channels, providing local anesthesia. Diclofenac inhibits COX enzymes, reducing pain and inflammation.
* **Side Effects:** Local irritation, burning, stinging; rarely methemoglobinemia (benzocaine) or allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, methemoglobinemia, G6PD deficiency, third-trimester pregnancy, CABG surgery.
* **Drug Interactions:**  See above.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  See above.
* **Dosage:** As directed on the product label.  Pediatric and special population dosing require adjustments.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** For prolonged use, monitor for signs of methemoglobinemia (cyanosis, shortness of breath) and for systemic effects of diclofenac (GI bleeding, renal or hepatic dysfunction).

## **Popular Combinations**

Topical benzocaine is sometimes combined with other local anesthetics or antiseptics. Diclofenac is available in various formulations and combinations for systemic use. However, the specific combination of benzocaine and diclofenac for topical use does not have widely recognized companion drugs used simultaneously.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess for allergies, G6PD deficiency, and history of methemoglobinemia before use.  
* **Specific Populations:** Caution advised in pregnant/breastfeeding women, children under 2, elderly, and those with renal/hepatic dysfunction.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid alcohol, smoking, and other factors that may exacerbate side effects.
