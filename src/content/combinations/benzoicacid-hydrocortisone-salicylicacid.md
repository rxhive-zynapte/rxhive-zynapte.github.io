## **Usage**

This topical medication is primarily prescribed for inflammatory skin conditions like psoriasis, eczema, and dermatitis. It is also used to treat ringworm, warts, corns, and acne.  It can be classified as a keratolytic, anti-inflammatory, and antifungal agent.

The mechanism of action involves the synergistic effects of its components. Salicylic acid promotes exfoliation of the stratum corneum (outermost skin layer) by breaking down keratin, thereby removing scales and softening the skin.  Hydrocortisone, a corticosteroid, provides anti-inflammatory action by suppressing the immune response and reducing redness, itching, and swelling. Benzoic acid acts as an antiseptic and antifungal agent, inhibiting microbial growth.


## **Alternate Names**

While no official alternate names exist, it is often referred to as a combination of its individual components. Brand names under which it is marketed include "Keralin Ointment" and "Whitolyn DS Ointment".


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The combined action of benzoic acid, hydrocortisone, and salicylic acid leads to a reduction in inflammation, scaling, and microbial growth on the skin.  Salicylic acid increases skin cell turnover and loosens the connections between corneocytes (skin cells), resulting in exfoliation. Hydrocortisone reduces inflammation by inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators. Benzoic acid hinders the growth of fungi and some bacteria.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  The medication is applied topically, and the extent of systemic absorption depends on factors like the concentration applied, the area of application, and the integrity of the skin barrier. Generally, systemic absorption is minimal. Salicylic acid is metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Hydrocortisone, when absorbed systemically, is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in urine.  Benzoic acid is conjugated with glycine in the liver and excreted in the urine as hippuric acid.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer to the affected skin area twice daily.

#### **Children:** Use with caution in children older than two years.  Consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosage based on the child's age and condition. Use is not recommended for children under two years.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution due to potential for increased systemic absorption. Monitor for adverse effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution is advised, as salicylic acid is excreted renally. Monitor for signs of salicylate toxicity.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advised, as both salicylic acid and hydrocortisone are metabolized in the liver.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with diabetes, as topical corticosteroids can affect blood glucose control.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical use cases such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not applicable as this medication is for topical use only.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustment is not usually required, but treatment duration should be limited to avoid adverse effects.
