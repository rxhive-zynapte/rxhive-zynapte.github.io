## **Usage**

Benzoxonium Chloride + Lidocaine is prescribed for the symptomatic treatment of mild mouth and throat infections, such as gingivitis, mouth ulcers (canker sores), stomatitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, and sore throat associated with colds.  It can also be used as an adjunctive therapy for tonsillitis.

Its pharmacological classifications include:

* **Antiseptic:** Benzoxonium chloride
* **Local anesthetic:** Lidocaine

**Mechanism of Action:** Benzoxonium chloride acts as an antiseptic, killing bacteria and other microorganisms. Lidocaine provides local pain relief by blocking nerve signals.


## **Alternate Names**

There is no widely recognized international nonproprietary name (INN) for this fixed-dose combination. However, the individual components have the following INNs:

* **Benzoxonium Chloride:** Benzoxonium chloride
* **Lidocaine:** Lidocaine

Brand names may vary in different countries. Some examples include Orocil Lido and Lidocam.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Benzoxonium Chloride:** A quaternary ammonium compound that disrupts the cell membranes of bacteria, fungi, and some viruses, leading to their inactivation or death.
* **Lidocaine:**  Blocks voltage-gated sodium channels in nerve cell membranes, inhibiting nerve impulse conduction and resulting in a localized loss of sensation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Benzoxonium Chloride:** Primarily acts locally with minimal systemic absorption. Data is available for a combination of benzoxonium/lidocaine product.
* **Lidocaine:** When applied topically in the mouth, some absorption may occur, although systemic levels are usually low. It is metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted by the kidneys.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

The dosage may vary depending on the specific product formulation (lozenges, spray, solution) and the severity of the infection. It's crucial to follow the instructions provided by the doctor or on the product label.

#### **Adults:**

Dosages for adults vary based on formulation and indication. Check the particular product literature.

#### **Children:**

Use in children should be under the guidance of a physician. Some formulations are indicated for children over 4 years old, while others are contraindicated in children under a certain age, or specific dosage recommendations cannot be given for this age group. 


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically required but use with caution, as with any medication.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Due to minimal systemic absorption, dosage adjustment is generally not needed.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Lidocaine is metabolized in the liver, but with topical oral use, significant systemic levels are unlikely. However, caution is advisable in severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consideration should be given to potential drug interactions and comorbid conditions, particularly cardiovascular disease.




### **Clinical Use Cases**

Benzoxonium Chloride + Lidocaine is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU. Its use is primarily limited to the management of mild oral and throat infections.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to benzoxonium chloride, lidocaine, or any other component of the formulation.

## **Drug Interactions**

Clinically significant drug interactions with topical Benzoxonium Chloride + Lidocaine are unlikely due to minimal systemic absorption. However, it is always best to inform your physician of all medications you are taking, including prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal products.
