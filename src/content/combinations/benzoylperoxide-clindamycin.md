## **Usage**

Benzoyl peroxide + clindamycin is prescribed for the topical treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris, particularly inflammatory lesions.  It is a fixed-dose combination product classified as a topical antibiotic and keratolytic agent. The combination exerts a synergistic effect by addressing both bacterial infection and follicular hyperkeratinization associated with acne.

## **Alternate Names**

Benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin topical is available under various brand names, including Acanya, Benzaclin, Duac, Neuac, Onexton, and Z-Clinz.  There may be other international or regional variations as well.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Clindamycin:**  A lincosamide antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria, primarily *Cutibacterium acnes* (formerly *Propionibacterium acnes*), a key contributor to acne inflammation.
* **Benzoyl Peroxide:** A keratolytic and antibacterial agent. It releases free radical oxygen species that oxidize bacterial proteins, leading to bacterial cell death. Additionally, it promotes desquamation and reduces comedone formation by breaking down keratin, a protein that contributes to clogged pores.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Clindamycin:**  Minimal systemic absorption occurs after topical application, minimizing the risk of systemic side effects.
* **Benzoyl Peroxide:**  Primarily exerts its effects locally within the skin.  A small amount of benzoyl peroxide may be absorbed and converted to benzoic acid, which is then excreted in the urine.

**Mode of Action (Cellular/Molecular):**

* **Clindamycin:**  Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit.
* **Benzoyl Peroxide:** Induces oxidative stress in bacterial cells, leading to their destruction.

**Elimination:**

* **Clindamycin:** Primarily excreted unchanged in the feces. A small amount of clindamycin that is systemically absorbed is metabolized by the liver.
* **Benzoyl Peroxide:** Converted to benzoic acid and excreted in the urine.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer of the gel or lotion to the affected area(s) once or twice daily, as directed by the physician.

#### **Children:** Use in children younger than 12 years of age is generally not recommended, as safety and efficacy have not been established in this population. For adolescents 12 years and older, the dosage is typically the same as for adults.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required due to minimal systemic absorption.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advised, as a small portion is metabolized by the liver.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient factors, such as a history of gastrointestinal disorders, and adjust accordingly.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Benzoyl peroxide + clindamycin is intended solely for topical use in the treatment of acne vulgaris. It is not indicated for use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are not generally required based on renal or hepatic function due to limited systemic absorption. If excessive dryness or irritation occurs, the frequency of application may be reduced or temporarily discontinued.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Dry skin
* Itching
* Peeling skin
* Redness
* Burning sensation
* Stinging sensation


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Antibiotic-associated colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis)


### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term use may lead to the development of antibiotic resistance in *C. acnes*.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

* Severe skin irritation
* Allergic contact dermatitis



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to clindamycin, benzoyl peroxide, lincomycin, or any components of the formulation.
* History of regional enteritis, ulcerative colitis, or antibiotic-associated colitis.



## **Drug Interactions**

* **Erythromycin:**  Concomitant use may result in antagonistic effects, as both drugs act on the bacterial ribosome.
* **Neuromuscular Blocking Agents:** Clindamycin has neuromuscular blocking properties and may potentiate the effects of these agents.
* **Topical Retinoids (e.g., tretinoin, tazarotene):**  May increase skin irritation if used concurrently. Consider applying at different times of day.
* **Other Topical Acne Medications:**  Concomitant use may increase the risk of cumulative irritation.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Limited data available. Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Not known if clindamycin or benzoyl peroxide is excreted in human milk. Exercise caution.  Avoid applying to the chest area to prevent infant exposure.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. Benzoyl peroxide is antibacterial and keratolytic.
* **Side Effects:** Dry skin, itching, peeling, redness, burning/stinging.  Rarely, allergic reactions or colitis.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, history of colitis.
* **Drug Interactions:** Erythromycin, neuromuscular blocking agents, topical retinoids.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Limited data; caution advised.
* **Dosage:** Apply thinly once or twice daily.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Observe for signs of skin irritation, allergic reactions, or gastrointestinal symptoms.

## **Popular Combinations**

Benzoyl peroxide + clindamycin is itself a popular combination. It is sometimes used in conjunction with oral antibiotics for more severe cases of acne, but this approach should be carefully considered due to concerns about antibiotic resistance.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Advise patients to avoid contact with eyes, mouth, and mucous membranes. Benzoyl peroxide can bleach hair and fabrics.
* **Specific Populations:** As above under "Pregnancy and Breastfeeding" and "Dosage - Special Cases".
* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Advise patients to use sunscreen and protective clothing, as this medication may increase sun sensitivity.
