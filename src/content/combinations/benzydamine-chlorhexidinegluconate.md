## **Usage**

Benzydamine + Chlorhexidine Gluconate is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of painful inflammatory conditions of the mouth and throat, such as gingivitis, stomatitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, aphthous ulcers (mouth ulcers), and oral mucositis (especially after radiotherapy or chemotherapy).  It also aids in mouth and throat antisepsis and can be used before and after dental procedures.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Benzydamine: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), Analgesic, Local anesthetic
* Chlorhexidine Gluconate: Antiseptic, Disinfectant

**Mechanism of Action:**

Benzydamine acts as an NSAID by stabilizing cell membranes and inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, thereby reducing inflammation and pain. It also provides local anesthetic action. Chlorhexidine gluconate exerts its antiseptic effect by disrupting bacterial cell membranes and inhibiting bacterial growth.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for the combination product itself. However, the individual components have other names:

* Benzydamine Hydrochloride
* Chlorhexidine digluconate

**Brand Names:**

Several brand names exist for products containing this combination, including Difflam-C, Andolex-C, Orofit, Oryza-C, Bensodyl, and Kloroben.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

Benzydamine's anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects stem from its action on cell membranes and prostaglandin synthesis. Its local anesthetic effect provides further pain relief. Chlorhexidine gluconate's antiseptic action comes from disrupting bacterial cell membranes, preventing their growth and spread.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Benzydamine is well-absorbed from the oral mucosa. Chlorhexidine gluconate has limited systemic absorption.
* **Metabolism:** Benzydamine is primarily metabolized in the liver.  Chlorhexidine is minimally metabolized.
* **Elimination:** Benzydamine and its metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine.  Chlorhexidine is excreted primarily in feces with a small portion in urine.

**Mode of Action:**

Benzydamine interacts with cell membranes, reduces prostaglandin production, and provides local anesthetic action. Chlorhexidine gluconate binds to bacterial cell walls and disrupts their integrity.

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**  Benzydamine stabilizes cell membranes and inhibits prostaglandin synthesis.  Chlorhexidine directly affects bacterial membranes without involving specific receptors or enzymes.

**Elimination pathways:**  Benzydamine undergoes hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.  Chlorhexidine primarily undergoes fecal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

15 ml of solution as a gargle or rinse every 1.5 to 3 hours. Alternatively, 4-8 sprays (0.15% solution) or 2-4 sprays (0.3% solution) every 1.5-3 hours, directed at the affected area.

#### **Children:**

Children over 12 years of age:  Same as adult dose.

Children under 12 years: Not recommended due to limited clinical data.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment typically required.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution advised; consider systemic effects due to potential accumulation of benzydamine and metabolites.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution advised; consider systemic effects due to benzydamine's hepatic metabolism.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Assess individual cases, particularly in patients with hypersensitivity reactions, asthma, or fructose intolerance.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  Dosage for specific medical settings aligns with standard adult or pediatric recommendations, as there are no specific guidelines for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use.  In emergency situations, the drug's use is not typically indicated.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Close monitoring is recommended. Consider other factors such as concurrent medications and individual patient response.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Oral numbness, altered taste perception, dry mouth, staining of teeth and tongue (mostly with chlorhexidine), burning or stinging sensation in the mouth.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic shock),  dizziness, headache.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic complications from prolonged use are rare, but may include increased calculus formation and persistent taste alteration with chlorhexidine.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, angioedema, hypotension, unconsciousness.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to benzydamine or chlorhexidine, pregnancy, breastfeeding.  Use cautiously in patients with a history of asthma or allergies to NSAIDs.


## **Drug Interactions**

Few drug interactions have been reported. Chlorhexidine is incompatible with anionic compounds like soap.  It is compatible with cationic and non-ionic surfactants, but high concentrations of these can reduce chlorhexidineâ€™s activity. The effect of anionic substances like sodium lauryl sulfate in toothpaste can interact with the cationic chlorhexidine, making brushing before use to reduce staining possibly counterproductive. Therefore, rinse thoroughly with water after toothbrushing prior to use.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential fetal risks and lack of data on breast milk excretion.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Benzydamine: NSAID, analgesic, local anesthetic. Chlorhexidine: antiseptic.
* **Side Effects:** Oral numbness, taste alteration, staining, burning/stinging sensation. Rarely: allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, pregnancy, breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** Limited. Incompatibility of Chlorhexidine with anionic substances.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
* **Dosage:** Adults/Children >12 years: 15ml rinse/gargle every 1.5-3 hours, or 4-8 sprays (0.15%)/ 2-4 sprays (0.3%) every 1.5-3 hours.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Observe for local side effects and allergic reactions.


## **Popular Combinations**

This combination itself is commonly used.  There are no other established popular drug combinations with this specific mix.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:**  Screen for allergies.  Use cautiously in patients with asthma or a history of allergic reactions to NSAIDs.
* **Specific Populations:** Avoid use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Not recommended for children under 12.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Limit consumption of staining agents like tea, coffee, and red wine during treatment with chlorhexidine. Brush teeth *before* use. Driving or operating machinery is generally not affected.
