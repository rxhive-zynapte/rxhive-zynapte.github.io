## **Usage**

This combination medication addresses nutritional deficiencies related to calcium, vitamin D3, and vitamin B12. It is prescribed to prevent or treat low blood calcium levels, especially in individuals with inadequate dietary calcium intake.  Additionally, it contributes to bone health, mitigates osteoporosis risk, supports red blood cell formation, and enhances iron absorption.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Nutritional Supplement, Vitamin/Mineral Supplement.

**Mechanism of Action:** Replenishes deficient nutrients; calcium gluconate supplies calcium, vitamin D3 promotes calcium absorption, and cyanocobalamin aids hematopoiesis and iron absorption. Benzyl alcohol serves as a local anesthetic at the injection site and the other added ingredients act as preservatives.

## **Alternate Names**

No officially recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination product. Individual components have alternate names (e.g., vitamin D3 as cholecalciferol, cyanocobalamin as vitamin B12). Brand names under which it's marketed include Sigmacal Vit and Brackt.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** This combination provides the body with essential nutrients: calcium for nerve and muscle function, bone health, and blood clotting; vitamin D3 for calcium absorption and bone health; and vitamin B12 for red blood cell production and nerve function.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:** Calcium gluconate absorption is influenced by vitamin D3 and dietary factors. Vitamin D3 is absorbed from the gut. Cyanocobalamin requires intrinsic factor for absorption in the small intestine.
* **Metabolism:** Vitamin D3 undergoes hepatic and renal metabolism to its active form, calcitriol. Cyanocobalamin is stored in the liver.
* **Elimination:** Calcium is excreted through urine and feces. Vitamin D3 metabolites are eliminated via bile and urine. Vitamin B12 undergoes enterohepatic circulation and renal excretion. Benzyl alcohol is metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** Calcium is crucial for numerous cellular processes. Vitamin D3 modulates gene expression related to calcium homeostasis. Cyanocobalamin is a cofactor in DNA synthesis and red blood cell formation.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Vitamin D3 binds to vitamin D receptors, regulating gene transcription.  Cyanocobalamin acts as a cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA synthesis.

## **Dosage**
