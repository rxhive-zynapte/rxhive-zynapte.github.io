## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily used topically for the relief of musculoskeletal pain associated with conditions such as:

* Sprains
* Strains
* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Back pain

**Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product with multiple classifications:

* **Diclofenac:** Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
* **Lidocaine:** Local anesthetic
* **Menthol & Methyl Salicylate:** Counterirritants
* **Tramadol:** Opioid analgesic
* **Linseed Oil:** Anti-inflammatory agent
* **Benzyl Alcohol:** Preservative, local anesthetic

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination targets pain through multiple pathways.  Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, thus decreasing inflammation and pain. Lidocaine blocks sodium channels, inhibiting nerve impulse transmission and providing local anesthesia.  Menthol and methyl salicylate act as counterirritants, creating cooling and warming sensations that distract from pain. Tramadol binds to mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system, altering pain perception. Linseed oil, rich in alpha-linolenic acid, further contributes to anti-inflammatory effects. Benzyl alcohol acts as a preservative and also has weak local anesthetic properties.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination, lacking a specific International Nonproprietary Name (INN), is typically referenced by its constituent drugs. Marketing varies by manufacturer, leading to different brand names, such as "Dolig Gel," "Imore Gel," and "Synofia Gel."  Some manufacturers might use variations on these names.



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  The combined effects of the ingredients produce analgesia and reduce inflammation at the application site. Diclofenac reduces prostaglandin synthesis; lidocaine provides local anesthetic action; menthol and methyl salicylate create counterirritant effects; and tramadol acts on opioid receptors for pain relief. Linseed oil adds to the anti-inflammatory action, while benzyl alcohol primarily acts as a preservative with minor local anesthetic effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  The ingredients are absorbed through the skin to varying degrees. Diclofenac and methyl salicylate are absorbed systemically to a small extent. Tramadol has limited systemic absorption when applied topically. Lidocaine, menthol, and linseed oil have minimal systemic absorption.  Metabolism and elimination pathways differ for each component, with diclofenac and tramadol being metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted renally. Methyl salicylate is metabolized to salicylic acid and excreted renally. Lidocaine is metabolized in the liver.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a thin layer to the affected area 3-4 times daily. The amount will depend on the size of the area.  Do not exceed the recommended dose or duration.


#### **Children:**

This combination is generally not recommended for use in children under 14 years of age. Some sources suggest contraindication for children under 2, while others suggest caution for children between 2 and 12. Pediatric use requires careful consideration and should be directed by a physician.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution. Due to potential age-related decrease in hepatic and renal function, consider dose reduction and monitor closely.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dose adjustment may be required based on creatinine clearance.  Tramadol, diclofenac, and methyl salicylate are renally cleared.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Diclofenac and tramadol are metabolized in the liver. Dose adjustment may be necessary.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise particular caution in patients with asthma, cardiovascular disease, or a history of gastrointestinal bleeding.  This combination can exacerbate these conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  The provided sources focus on pain relief from musculoskeletal conditions. There is no data supporting its use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or emergency situations. 


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments must be made based on individual patient factors like renal or hepatic function, age, and concurrent medications. Patient response should also guide any dosage modifications.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
* Application site reactions (itching, redness, burning sensation, dryness)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, angioedema, difficulty breathing)
* Seizures (with tramadol overuse)
* Serotonin syndrome (with tramadol and other serotonergic drugs)
* Respiratory depression (with tramadol overdose)


### **Long-Term Effects:**

* Skin thinning or discoloration (with prolonged topical corticosteroid use, if present in some formulations)
* Tramadol dependence (with chronic use)

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any serious or unexpected reaction needs immediate reporting to a healthcare professional.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any component
* Third-trimester pregnancy
* Severe hepatic or renal impairment
* Respiratory depression
* Acute intoxication with alcohol, hypnotics, centrally acting analgesics, opioids, or psychotropic drugs
* Concomitant use of MAO inhibitors
* Asthma, urticaria, or acute rhinitis precipitated by aspirin or other NSAIDs
* Patients with renal impairment
* Hypersensitivity


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Diclofenac:** Anticoagulants (warfarin), lithium, methotrexate, other NSAIDs, aspirin
* **Lidocaine:** Antiarrhythmic drugs, certain antidepressants
* **Tramadol:** Other opioids, antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs), MAO inhibitors, alcohol, sedatives, CYP2D6 inhibitors or inducers
* **Methyl Salicylate:** Anticoagulants (warfarin)
* **Menthol:** Warfarin (oral) may decrease effectiveness.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Contraindicated in the third trimester. Use with caution during the first and second trimesters only if the benefits outweigh the risks. May cause harm to the fetus and complications with labor/delivery. 

* **Breastfeeding:** Consult a physician before use. Tramadol is present in breastmilk in small amounts. Diclofenac and ibuprofen are often preferred for breastfeeding mothers. Other components have limited data regarding breast milk excretion. Exercise caution.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Multimodal: NSAID (diclofenac and methyl salicylate), local anesthetic (lidocaine), counterirritant (menthol and methyl salicylate), opioid analgesic (tramadol), anti-inflammatory (linseed oil).

* **Side Effects:** Itching, redness, burning at application site; rarely, allergic reactions, seizures (tramadol), serotonin syndrome, respiratory depression.

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, third-trimester pregnancy, severe hepatic/renal impairment, respiratory depression, concomitant MAOI use.

* **Drug Interactions:**  See Drug Interactions section.

* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult a physician. Contraindicated in third-trimester pregnancy.  Caution advised during breastfeeding.

## **Popular Combinations**

This combination itself is already a mix of several active ingredients.  Additional combinations are generally not recommended unless specifically directed by a physician.  Concomitant use of oral pain medications, especially NSAIDs or opioids, should be carefully considered due to interaction risks.
