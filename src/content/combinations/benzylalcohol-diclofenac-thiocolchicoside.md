## **Usage**

- This combination is prescribed for the relief of pain and muscle spasm associated with musculoskeletal conditions such as low back pain, neck pain (e.g., torticollis), sprains, strains, frozen shoulder, and other musculoskeletal injuries.  Topical formulations are used for localized relief, while injections are used for systemic delivery when needed.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) + Muscle relaxant + Antimicrobial preservative (benzyl alcohol, primarily in topical formulations).

## **Alternate Names**

- Diclofenac + Thiocolchicoside + Benzyl Alcohol
- Brand names: Aquafast TH, Dicwed TH, Dolense Th, Serofin-TH, and others.  Many different brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and specific formulation.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, thereby diminishing inflammation and pain. Thiocolchicoside acts centrally to reduce muscle tone and spasm, likely by activating GABA inhibitory pathways. Benzyl alcohol provides additional local anesthetic and antiseptic effects in topical preparations.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - Diclofenac: Well-absorbed orally and intramuscularly. Metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2C9. Excreted renally and in bile.
    - Thiocolchicoside: Metabolized in the liver. Excreted primarily in the urine.
    - Benzyl alcohol: Metabolized to benzoic acid and excreted in the urine.
- **Mode of Action:** Diclofenac's principal mechanism of action is the inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. COX enzymes catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, which play essential roles in pain and inflammation. Thiocolchicoside's action is believed to be through modulation of GABAergic neurotransmission within the spinal cord, reducing muscle tone and spasm.  In topical formulations, benzyl alcohol acts as a local anesthetic and antiseptic.

## **Dosage**

Dosage varies significantly depending on the formulation (injection, gel, cream) and specific product.  Always consult the specific product information and follow the prescribing physician's directions.
