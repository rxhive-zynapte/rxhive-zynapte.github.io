## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the topical treatment of fungal skin infections, such as:

*   Athlete's foot (tinea pedis)
*   Jock itch (tinea cruris)
*   Ringworm (tinea corporis)

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Antifungal (allylamine class) and topical anesthetic.

**Mechanism of Action:** Naftifine inhibits squalene epoxidase, a crucial enzyme in fungal ergosterol biosynthesis. This disrupts the fungal cell membrane, leading to cell death. Benzyl alcohol provides local anesthesia, relieving itching and discomfort. It also acts as a preservative in the cream formulation.

## **Alternate Names**

*   Naftifast Cream
*   Nafbor 2% Cream


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Naftifine's antifungal action stems from squalene epoxidase inhibition. This enzyme is essential for ergosterol synthesis, a vital component of fungal cell membranes. Its inhibition causes squalene accumulation and ergosterol deficiency, disrupting membrane integrity and resulting in fungal cell death.  Benzyl alcohol provides a local anesthetic effect, relieving itching and pain.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Topical application leads to minimal systemic absorption of both naftifine and benzyl alcohol.

**Mode of Action:** Naftifine inhibits squalene epoxidase.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Inhibits the enzyme squalene epoxidase.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily through hepatic metabolism, with minimal renal excretion due to low systemic absorption.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer to the affected skin and surrounding area once daily for two weeks.

#### **Children:**

*   **2 years and older:** Apply a thin layer once daily to the affected area and surrounding area for two weeks (for tinea corporis).

*   **Under 2 years (tinea corporis) and under 12 years (tinea cruris and tinea pedis):** Safety and effectiveness not established. Consult a doctor.



#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are needed unless renal or hepatic impairment is present.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No adjustments needed due to minimal systemic absorption.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No adjustments needed due to minimal systemic absorption.
