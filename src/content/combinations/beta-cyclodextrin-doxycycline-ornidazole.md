## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for various bacterial infections, including:

*   Respiratory tract infections (pneumonia, bronchitis)
*   Sexually transmitted infections (gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis)
*   Urinary tract infections
*   Skin and soft tissue infections (cellulitis, acne)
*   Gum disease (periodontitis)
*   Certain parasitic infections (amebiasis, giardiasis, trichomoniasis)

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic

**Mechanism of Action:** This drug combines three active ingredients:

*   **Doxycycline:** A tetracycline antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, thus halting bacterial growth.
*   **Ornidazole:** A nitroimidazole antibiotic that damages bacterial DNA by forming reactive intermediates, leading to bacterial death. It is particularly effective against anaerobic bacteria and certain parasites.
*   **Beta-Cyclodextrin:** A complexing agent that enhances the solubility and absorption of doxycycline and ornidazole, increasing their bioavailability and effectiveness.

## **Alternate Names**

*   Dox-M-OZ
*   Doxycycline + Ornidazole + Beta-Cyclodextrin

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

*   Doxycycline: Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis.
*   Ornidazole: Disrupts bacterial DNA structure and function.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   Absorption: Both doxycycline and ornidazole are well-absorbed orally. Beta-cyclodextrin enhances their absorption.
*   Metabolism: Doxycycline is primarily excreted unchanged. Ornidazole is metabolized in the liver.
*   Elimination: Doxycycline is eliminated through urine and feces. Ornidazole metabolites are excreted in the urine.

**Mode of Action:**

*   Doxycycline: Binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit, inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis.
*   Ornidazole: Forms reactive intermediates that interact with and damage bacterial DNA.

**Elimination Pathways:**

*   Doxycycline: Renal and fecal excretion.
*   Ornidazole: Hepatic metabolism followed by renal excretion of metabolites.


## **Dosage**

Dosage and duration are determined by the infection's type and severity and should be adjusted based on individual patient factors.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   One tablet (Doxycycline 100mg + Ornidazole 500mg + Beta-Cyclodextrin 50mg) once or twice daily.
*   Treatment duration: 5 to 14 days.

#### **Children:**

*   Dosage is determined by weight or age, and the infection's type and severity.
*   Tetracyclines like doxycycline should be used cautiously in children younger than 8 years old due to the risk of permanent tooth discoloration.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Adjustments may be necessary based on kidney and liver function.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment may be required in severe renal impairment.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary in severe liver disease.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider adjustments for conditions affecting drug metabolism or clearance (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease).

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical settings (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, emergency situations) are not specifically defined for this fixed-dose combination.  Dosage is adjusted based on the infection, patient condition, and other clinical factors.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications might be necessary based on patient-specific factors such as renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

*   Headache
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Diarrhea
*   Stomach pain
*   Photosensitivity
*   Loss of appetite

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

*   Severe allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, shortness of breath)
*   Blood disorders (bruising, bleeding, sore throat, fever, fatigue)
*   Severe diarrhea (watery or bloody stools)
*   Liver dysfunction
*   Kidney damage

### **Long-Term Effects**

*   Permanent tooth discoloration (especially in children)

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs requiring immediate intervention include severe allergic reactions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.

## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to tetracyclines or nitroimidazoles
*   Pregnancy (especially second and third trimesters)
*   Children under 8 years old (except for severe or life-threatening infections)

## **Drug Interactions**

*   Antacids, iron supplements, calcium supplements, and multivalent cations reduce doxycycline absorption.
*   Alcohol can cause a disulfiram-like reaction with ornidazole.
*   Doxycycline may potentiate the effects of anticoagulants (warfarin).
*   This medication may alter the metabolism of antiepileptic drugs.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

*   **Pregnancy:** Contraindicated, particularly in the second and third trimesters, due to fetal harm risk (tooth discoloration and skeletal development issues).
*   **Breastfeeding:** Safety not established. Use with caution.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** Doxycycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis; ornidazole damages bacterial DNA; beta-cyclodextrin enhances absorption.
*   **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, photosensitivity (common); severe allergic reactions, blood disorders (rare but serious).
*   **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, children under 8, hypersensitivity to components.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Antacids, iron/calcium supplements, alcohol, anticoagulants, antiepileptic drugs.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy; caution during breastfeeding.
*   **Dosage:** Adults: one tablet once or twice daily; pediatric: weight/age-based.
*   **Monitoring Parameters:** Infection resolution, adverse reactions, liver/kidney function.

## **Popular Combinations**

This drug is a combination product. Combining it with additional antibiotics is generally avoided unless specifically indicated and monitored for drug interactions.

## **Precautions**

*   **General:** Pre-screening for allergies, metabolic disorders, organ dysfunction.
*   **Pregnant Women:** Avoid use.
*   **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Use with caution.
