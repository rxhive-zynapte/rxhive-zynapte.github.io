## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for gastrointestinal infections caused by susceptible bacteria and protozoa, including diarrhea and dysentery.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic, antiprotozoal.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Norfloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair. Tinidazole, a nitroimidazole antibiotic, disrupts the DNA of anaerobic bacteria and some protozoa. Beta-cyclodextrin enhances the solubility and absorption of norfloxacin and tinidazole.

## **Alternate Names**

- Norflosh-TZ
- N Flox TZ
- Floxnor TZ
- **Brand Names:**  Floxnor TZ, N Flox TZ, Norpex TZ

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Norfloxacin exerts a bactericidal effect by inhibiting bacterial topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV.  Tinidazole interacts with microbial DNA, causing strand breakage and inhibiting nucleic acid synthesis, ultimately leading to cell death. Beta-cyclodextrin improves the solubility and dissolution rate of norfloxacin and tinidazole, thereby enhancing their absorption.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Norfloxacin is partially absorbed orally and undergoes hepatic metabolism. It is primarily excreted renally. Tinidazole is well-absorbed orally, metabolized hepatically, and also excreted renally. Beta-cyclodextrin improves the bioavailability of both norfloxacin and tinidazole.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for both norfloxacin and tinidazole.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
One tablet (Norfloxacin 400mg + Tinidazole 600mg + Beta-cyclodextrin 10mg) twice daily for 3 to 7 days.  The maximum dosage should not exceed 800mg of Norfloxacin and 1200mg of Tinidazole per day. Administer orally, with or without food.

#### **Children:**
This combination is generally not recommended for children due to the risk of tendon rupture and cartilage damage.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:**  Administer with caution due to potential age-related decline in renal function. Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment is necessary based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution advised, especially in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, seizures, or myasthenia gravis.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. It is specifically indicated for gastrointestinal infections.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
Dosage adjustments may be required for patients with renal or hepatic impairment based on creatinine clearance or liver function tests, respectively.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Peripheral neuropathy and tendon damage (rare).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Tendon rupture, seizures, severe allergic reactions, *C. difficile* infection.

## **Contraindications**

- History of tendon rupture with fluoroquinolones.
- Myasthenia gravis.
- Pregnancy (especially first trimester).
- Breastfeeding.
- Children.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Antacids, sucralfate, metal cations (calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc), and multivitamins can reduce norfloxacin absorption.
- Norfloxacin can enhance the effects of warfarin and other anticoagulants.
- Concurrent use with other QT-prolonging drugs should be avoided.
- Alcohol should be avoided during and shortly after tinidazole treatment.
- Probenecid may increase tinidazole levels.
- Other antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin), NSAIDs (e.g., aspirin), vaccines for cholera and typhoid.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Contraindicated, especially during the first trimester, due to the potential for fetal harm.
- **Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated as norfloxacin and tinidazole are excreted in breast milk.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Norfloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV; tinidazole disrupts microbial DNA; beta-cyclodextrin enhances absorption.
- **Side Effects:**  Nausea, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, seizures.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, tendon rupture history, myasthenia gravis, pregnancy, breastfeeding, children.
- **Drug Interactions:** Antacids, warfarin, QT prolonging drugs, alcohol, probenecid, other antibiotics, NSAIDs.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
- **Dosage:** Adults: One tablet (400mg/600mg/10mg) twice daily for 3-7 days. Adjust for renal/hepatic impairment.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, liver function, signs of tendonitis/rupture, neurological symptoms.

## **Popular Combinations**

This medication is a combination product. Combining it with other antibiotics is not typically recommended unless specifically indicated by a specialist for complex or resistant infections.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess renal and hepatic function before and during treatment. Screen for allergies.
