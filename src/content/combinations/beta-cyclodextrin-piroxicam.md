## **Usage**

Beta-cyclodextrin + piroxicam is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of various inflammatory and painful conditions, including:

*   Rheumatoid arthritis
*   Osteoarthritis
*   Ankylosing spondylitis
*   Musculoskeletal and joint disorders
*   Gout
*   Soft-tissue disorders
*   Post-operative pain
*   Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (mentioned in one source)

**Pharmacological Classification:** Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID)

**Mechanism of Action:** Piroxicam, the active ingredient, inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing the production of prostaglandins, which are mediators of inflammation, pain, and fever. Beta-cyclodextrin enhances piroxicam's solubility and absorption.

## **Alternate Names**

While "piroxicam beta-cyclodextrin" is the common generic name, there are several brand names under which this drug is marketed, including:

*   Brexin
*   Nysa
* Feldene Flash

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Piroxicam exerts its analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic effects primarily through the inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. This action reduces the synthesis of prostaglandins, which are involved in mediating inflammation, pain, and fever.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Piroxicam is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations reached within 30 to 60 minutes. Beta-cyclodextrin enhances its solubility and dissolution, leading to faster absorption compared to unmodified piroxicam. Beta-cyclodextrin itself is not absorbed.
*   **Metabolism:** Piroxicam is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by hydroxylation and conjugation with glucuronic acid.
*   **Elimination:** Piroxicam is primarily eliminated through the kidneys (urine), with a small amount excreted in the feces. It has a long elimination half-life of approximately 50 hours.  Enterohepatic recycling occurs.

**Mode of Action:** Piroxicam's mechanism of action involves non-selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. By binding to the active sites of both COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms, it reduces the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin precursors, effectively lowering prostaglandin levels. This disruption of prostaglandin synthesis accounts for piroxicam's analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. The complexation with beta-cyclodextrin improves piroxicam's aqueous solubility, thereby enhancing its bioavailability.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** The primary mechanism involves enzyme inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2).


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The recommended initial dose is 20 mg once daily.

#### **Children:** Dosage and indications in children have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** A lower initial dose of 10 mg daily is recommended, and the duration of treatment should be limited.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary based on creatinine clearance.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Careful monitoring and potential dose adjustment may be required.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustment should be individualized based on the specific comorbidity.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The sources do not provide specific dosage recommendations for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) use, or emergency situations. Dosage should be determined on a case-by-case basis, considering patient-specific factors.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage should be adjusted for elderly patients, patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and those with comorbid conditions. Individualized adjustments are necessary.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Gastrointestinal issues (dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea)
*   Headache
*   Dizziness

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
*   Stevens-Johnson syndrome
*   Toxic epidermal necrolysis
*   Severe skin reactions
*   Renal impairment

### **Long-Term Effects:** Chronic use can increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as ulcers and bleeding.

*   Antihypertensives (reduced antihypertensive effect)
*   Diuretics (decreased diuretic effect)
*   Lithium (increased lithium levels)
*   Methotrexate (increased methotrexate toxicity)
*   Other NSAIDs (increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects)

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Piroxicam is generally avoided during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, due to the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. It is also not recommended during breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:**  COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor, reduces prostaglandin synthesis.
*   **Side Effects:**  GI issues, headache, dizziness, rash, serious GI bleeding, skin reactions, renal impairment.

*   **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, antihypertensives, diuretics, lithium, methotrexate, other NSAIDs.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Generally avoided.
*   **Dosage:** Adults: 20mg daily (initially), Elderly: 10 mg daily.
*   **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, liver function, signs of GI bleeding, blood pressure.

## **Popular Combinations**

Information on popular combinations isn't available in the provided sources. However, combination therapy with gastroprotective agents (e.g., proton pump inhibitors) should be carefully considered, especially in elderly patients.

## **Precautions**

*   Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.
*   Monitor for GI bleeding, renal function, and liver function.
*   Caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or risk factors for cardiovascular events.
