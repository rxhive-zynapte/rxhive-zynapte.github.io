## **Usage**

This combination of nutrients is primarily used as a dietary supplement to address nutritional deficiencies and support overall health.  It is often prescribed to prevent chronic diseases, promote healthy growth and development, and improve immune function.  It does not fit a single pharmacological classification but acts as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune booster through the synergistic effects of its components.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination product may be marketed under various brand names such as WAYLIC-PLUS, MV-4G, Lycoprax, Begold, and Oxivik. There are no widely recognized international or regional variations for this specific combination.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Beta-carotene and Lycopene:**  Act as antioxidants, scavenging free radicals and protecting cells from oxidative damage.  Beta-carotene is a precursor to vitamin A, contributing to eye health, immune function, and healthy skin.  Lycopene is associated with cardiovascular health and a reduced risk of certain cancers.
* **Black Grape Seed Extract:** Contains antioxidants (oligomeric proanthocyanidin complexes or OPCs) that may further reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, contributing to cardiovascular and skin health.
* **Lutein:** Primarily concentrated in the macula of the eye, it acts as a light filter, protecting eye tissues from sunlight damage and age-related macular degeneration.
* **Selenium dioxide:**  Essential for the proper functioning of selenoproteins, which play a role in antioxidant defense, thyroid hormone metabolism, and immune function.
* **Zinc sulfate:** Crucial for immune function, wound healing, cell growth, and maintaining gut health.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The combined pharmacokinetics of this formulation aren't fully understood. The individual components have established pharmacokinetic profiles, but their interactions within this combination are not comprehensively studied.  Zinc and selenium are primarily excreted in the urine, with some elimination through the feces. Beta-carotene, lycopene, and lutein are metabolized and excreted via the liver and bile.
