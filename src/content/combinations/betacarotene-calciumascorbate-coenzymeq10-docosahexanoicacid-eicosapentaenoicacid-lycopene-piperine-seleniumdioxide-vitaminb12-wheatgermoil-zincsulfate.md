## **Usage**

This combination of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fatty acids is primarily used to treat and prevent nutritional deficiencies. It supports overall health by supplementing essential nutrients that may be lacking in the diet. It's often prescribed for general well-being, immune support, and to address specific deficiencies.  It is not classified under a single pharmacological classification, but rather as a nutritional supplement. Its mechanism of action involves providing the body with essential nutrients to support various physiological processes.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no internationally recognized non-proprietary name for this specific combination. Several brand names exist (e.g., AV-Ten, Q-Mac). The exact composition may vary slightly between brands.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Each component has specific effects. Beta-carotene, lycopene are antioxidants. Vitamin B12 is crucial for nerve function and red blood cell production.  Coenzyme Q10 is involved in cellular energy production.  Docosahexanoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are omega-3 fatty acids important for brain health and cardiovascular function. Zinc supports immune function and cell growth. Calcium ascorbate (vitamin C) is an antioxidant and supports collagen synthesis. Selenium is an essential trace mineral with antioxidant properties. Piperine enhances the bioavailability of certain nutrients. Wheat germ oil provides additional nutrients like vitamin E.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Absorption, metabolism, and elimination vary for each component. For example, fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) are absorbed with fats, while water-soluble vitamins (B and C) are absorbed directly into the bloodstream.  Piperine can enhance the absorption of some components. Elimination occurs through various pathways including renal and hepatic excretion.
