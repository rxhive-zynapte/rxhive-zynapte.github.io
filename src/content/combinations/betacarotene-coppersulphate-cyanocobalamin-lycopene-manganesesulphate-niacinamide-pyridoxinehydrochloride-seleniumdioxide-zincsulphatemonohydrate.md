## **Usage**

This combination of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to address deficiencies in these nutrients. It is generally prescribed for individuals with poor diets, conditions affecting nutrient absorption, increased nutrient demands (e.g., pregnancy, lactation), recovery from illness or surgery, and specific dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarianism, veganism).  It supports various bodily functions, including vision, immune function, skin health, energy production, and tissue formation.

## **Alternate Names**

* Albuvit Softgel Capsule (brand name)

## **How It Works**

This combination product works through the synergistic action of its individual components:

* **Beta-carotene:**  A precursor to vitamin A, acts as an antioxidant and supports vision, immune function, and skin health. It is converted to vitamin A as needed by the body.
* **Copper Sulphate:**  Copper is a component of several enzymes involved in energy production, iron metabolism, tissue formation, and neurotransmitter synthesis.
* **Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12):** Essential for red blood cell formation, nerve function, and DNA synthesis.
* **Lycopene:** An antioxidant that may protect against certain types of cancer and cardiovascular disease.
* **Manganese Sulphate:** Essential for bone health, blood sugar regulation, wound healing, and also acts as an antioxidant.  It contributes to the metabolism of cholesterol, glucose, amino acids, and carbohydrates. It also plays a significant role in blood clotting and bone formation.
* **Niacinamide (Vitamin B3):**  Plays a vital role in energy metabolism, DNA repair, and cell signaling.
* **Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6):**  Involved in various metabolic processes, including protein synthesis, red blood cell formation, and nerve function.
* **Selenium dioxide:**  A source of selenium, an antioxidant that protects cells from damage and may have roles in thyroid function and immune health. Prevents cell damage and protects the body from the poisonous effects of heavy metals.
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:** Zinc supports immune function, protein synthesis, wound healing, and cell division.

The pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of this combination product are complex due to the different properties of each component. Generally, these nutrients are absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, metabolized in the liver, and excreted through urine or feces.
