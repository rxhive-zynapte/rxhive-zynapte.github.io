## **Usage**

This combination is prescribed for the management and treatment of combined nutritional deficiencies of beta-carotene, copper, manganese, selenium, and zinc.  It is also used as a therapeutic nutritional adjunct in conditions where the intake or absorption of vitamins and minerals is suboptimal. This might be in cases such as: malignancy, immune deficiency syndromes, malabsorption, inflammatory bowel disease, short bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, during convalescence from illness or surgery, patients on restricted diets, food intolerance, or when concurrent medication decreases vitamin and mineral absorption.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Nutritional Supplement, Antioxidant

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination replenishes deficient micronutrients. Beta-carotene converts to vitamin A, crucial for vision, immunity, and skin health. Copper, manganese, selenium, and zinc are cofactors for enzymes involved in antioxidant defense, bone health, immune function, and wound healing.


## **Alternate Names**

Beta Carotene + Copper + Manganese + Selenium + Zinc Sulfate; Multivitamin/Multimineral Supplement; Antioxidant Formula.  Some brand names include Dermoxid-HC Softgel Capsule and Glowishma Softgel Capsule.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Beta-carotene acts as a precursor to vitamin A, an essential nutrient for cell growth and differentiation, vision, reproduction, and immune function. Copper is vital for iron metabolism, collagen formation, and nerve function. Manganese is involved in bone formation, wound healing, and metabolism. Selenium is crucial for thyroid hormone metabolism and antioxidant function.  Zinc supports immune function, cell growth, and wound healing.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Absorption, metabolism, and elimination vary for each component. Beta-carotene is absorbed in the small intestine and converted to vitamin A. Copper is absorbed and transported by ceruloplasmin, while manganese absorption is limited. Selenium is readily absorbed and incorporated into selenoproteins. Zinc is absorbed in the small intestine and bound to proteins. Elimination pathways include renal and hepatic excretion.


**Mode of Action:** Beta-carotene acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from free radical damage. Copper, manganese, selenium, and zinc are cofactors for various enzymes involved in metabolic processes.  This may include receptor binding, enzyme activation, and neurotransmitter modulation.


## **Dosage**

Dosage is individualized based on the specific deficiencies and patient factors.  A healthcare professional should be consulted to determine the appropriate dosage.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** No standardized dosage exists.  Dosage depends on individual needs and product formulation. Physician consultation is crucial.

#### **Children:** Dosage is determined by age, weight, and the specific deficiency. Consultation with a pediatrician is essential.

#### **Special Cases:** Dosage adjustments are made based on individual patient factors such as age, organ function, and comorbid conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific clinical settings is determined by the patient's nutritional needs and the severity of their condition. No specific dosage guidelines are available for this combination in situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be necessary based on renal or hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, upset stomach, and yellowing of skin (with excessive beta-carotene intake).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

 Allergic reactions, copper toxicity (with excessive intake).

### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential long-term effects depend on the individual components and their dosages.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs are rare but may include gastrointestinal issues and allergic reactions.


## **Contraindications**

Known hypersensitivity to any of the components.  Caution is advised in patients with Wilson's disease (copper accumulation) and hemochromatosis (iron overload).

## **Drug Interactions**

Interactions may occur with certain medications, such as those affecting mineral absorption.  Alcohol may interfere with the absorption of some nutrients.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult with a healthcare professional before use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Dosages should not exceed the recommended daily allowance.
