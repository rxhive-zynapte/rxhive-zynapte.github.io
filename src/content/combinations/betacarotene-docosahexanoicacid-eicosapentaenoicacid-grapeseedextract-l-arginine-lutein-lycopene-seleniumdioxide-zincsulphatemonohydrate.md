## **Usage**

This combination of ingredients is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to support overall health and address specific deficiencies.  It is often recommended for its potential antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-boosting properties. While it isn't a drug prescribed for treating specific diseases, it's suggested for promoting general well-being and preventing chronic diseases, potentially reducing the risk of eye problems, enhancing skin hydration, reducing inflammation, and supporting immune function. It does not fall under a single pharmacological classification, but rather acts as a multivitamin and multimineral supplement. The mechanism of action involves the combined effects of its individual components, contributing to various physiological processes.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination does not have a universally recognized International Nonproprietary Name (INN). It is generally referred to by its constituent ingredients.  One brand name identified is OMEGASHINE L.  Other brand names might exist.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** This combination exerts its effects through the synergistic action of its components.

* **Beta-carotene:** A precursor to vitamin A, it acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals.
* **Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) and Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA):** Omega-3 fatty acids crucial for brain and eye health, with anti-inflammatory effects.
* **Grape Seed Extract:** Rich in antioxidants that may help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress.
* **L-Arginine:** An amino acid involved in various metabolic processes, including nitric oxide production, which promotes vasodilation.
* **Lutein and Lycopene:** Carotenoids that act as antioxidants and are particularly beneficial for eye health.
* **Selenium dioxide:** An essential trace mineral with antioxidant properties, supporting immune function.
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:**  Essential for immune function, cell growth, and wound healing.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  The absorption, metabolism, and elimination of each component vary. 

* **Beta-carotene:** Absorbed in the small intestine, converted to vitamin A in the liver, and stored primarily in the liver.
* **DHA and EPA:** Absorbed in the small intestine, incorporated into cell membranes, and metabolized in the liver.
* **Other components:** Absorbed and metabolized through various pathways, with elimination primarily through renal and hepatic routes.

Specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation for each component is complex and beyond the scope of this summary.
