## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for Ménière's disease, a disorder of the inner ear that can cause vertigo (spinning sensation), tinnitus (ringing in the ears), hearing loss, and nausea.  Domperidone is added to alleviate nausea and vomiting associated with vertigo.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Betahistine is a histamine analogue with weak H1 agonist and stronger H3 antagonist activity, while domperidone is a dopamine antagonist and antiemetic.  This combination falls under the classes of vestibular agents and antiemetics.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Betahistine improves blood microcirculation in the inner ear and inhibits neuronal excitability in the vestibular nuclei, reducing the symptoms of Ménière's disease. Domperidone acts as an antiemetic by blocking dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), located in the brain's medulla oblongata.  This action helps to suppress nausea and vomiting.


## **Alternate Names**

There isn't a globally recognized alternate name for this specific combination.  However, the components are sometimes referred to as:
* **Betahistine:**  Sometimes referred to as betahistine dihydrochloride.
* **Domperidone:** Sometimes referred to as domperidone maleate.

Brand names vary by region.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Betahistine enhances blood flow to the inner ear, stabilizing the endolymphatic system, thus reducing vestibular symptoms.  Domperidone peripherally and centrally blocks dopamine receptors, relieving nausea and vomiting.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    * **Betahistine:** Well-absorbed orally, extensively metabolized, primarily in the liver, and excreted in the urine.
    * **Domperidone:** Orally absorbed but subject to significant first-pass metabolism; primarily metabolized in the liver (by CYP3A4) and excreted in urine and feces.

- **Mode of Action (Cellular/Molecular):** Betahistine is believed to act as a partial agonist at H1 receptors, improving microcirculation and reducing endolymph pressure in the inner ear. Its H3 antagonism in the vestibular nuclei further modulates neuronal activity.  Domperidone acts as a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist in the CTZ.


- **Elimination Pathways:** Both drugs are primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism with subsequent renal excretion.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Betahistine is typically started at 8-16 mg three times a day, taken orally with meals. The dose may be increased to a maximum of 48 mg per day, adjusted according to individual response.  Domperidone is typically administered at 10 mg three times a day, with a maximum daily dose of 30 mg.  The combination may be prescribed as a fixed-dose tablet containing 16 mg betahistine and 10 mg domperidone, taken three times daily.


#### **Children:**

The combination is generally not recommended for pediatric use unless specifically directed by a specialist. Individual components may be used under specialist guidance with careful dose adjustment based on age and weight.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Start with lower doses and titrate cautiously, monitoring renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustment of both drugs may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Domperidone is contraindicated in moderate to severe hepatic impairment. Betahistine should be used with caution and at lower doses.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with cardiovascular conditions, as domperidone may prolong the QT interval.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination's use is focused on managing Ménière's disease. Other specific clinical use cases where this combination might be employed off-label are best determined on a case-by-case basis by a specialist, considering potential risks and benefits.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are required in renal/hepatic impairment. Consider genetic polymorphisms affecting CYP3A4 activity when using domperidone.


## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects:**

- Headache
- Nausea (though domperidone is intended to reduce it)
- Dyspepsia
- Drowsiness

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- QT prolongation (domperidone)
- Extrapyramidal symptoms (domperidone) – more common in children


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term side effects of the combination are not well-established.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Cardiac arrhythmias with domperidone use necessitate urgent attention.


## **Contraindications**

- Phaeochromocytoma (betahistine)
- Moderate to severe hepatic impairment (domperidone)
- Concomitant use of QT-prolonging drugs or potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (domperidone)
- Gastrointestinal obstruction, hemorrhage, or perforation (domperidone)
- Prolactin-releasing pituitary tumor (domperidone)


## **Drug Interactions**

- Anticholinergics may reduce the effectiveness of domperidone.
- CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin) increase domperidone levels.
- QT-prolonging agents increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Betahistine:**  Limited data suggest it may be used cautiously during pregnancy if the benefits outweigh risks.
- **Domperidone:**  Use with caution; it is present in breast milk, and although serious effects in infants are rare, they are possible.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Betahistine: Improves inner ear microcirculation and modulates vestibular neuronal activity. Domperidone: Dopamine D2 antagonist, suppressing nausea and vomiting.
- **Side Effects:** Headache, nausea, dyspepsia, QT prolongation (domperidone).
- **Contraindications:**  See detailed section above.
- **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors, QT-prolonging agents, anticholinergics.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use cautiously if benefits outweigh risks; domperidone is present in breast milk.
- **Dosage:** Betahistine: 8-48 mg/day; Domperidone: up to 30 mg/day.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Cardiac rhythm (ECG for QT interval) with domperidone, particularly in higher doses or the elderly.


## **Popular Combinations**

While betahistine and domperidone are prescribed together, data on other popular combinations is limited, and their use should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by a specialist.


## **Precautions**

Standard precautions regarding allergies and organ function should be observed. Special care for pregnant/breastfeeding women and children.  Driving may be affected due to vertigo or drowsiness.
