## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** This combination is primarily prescribed for Ménière's disease, a condition affecting the inner ear that causes vertigo (dizziness), tinnitus (ringing in the ears), nausea, and hearing difficulties. It may also be used for other conditions like vertigo of vascular origin and to improve memory and concentration.  
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Betahistine is classified as an anti-vertigo agent and a histamine analogue. Ginkgo biloba is considered an herbal medicine, often categorized for its claimed antioxidant, neuroprotective, and vasodilatory properties.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Betahistine primarily acts on the histamine H1 and H3 receptors in the inner ear, improving blood flow and reducing fluid pressure, thus alleviating symptoms of Ménière's disease. Ginkgo biloba is thought to enhance blood circulation in the brain and inner ear while potentially exhibiting antioxidant and neuroprotective effects.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination product. However, the individual components may have other names.
- **Brand Names:** While brand names may vary regionally, this combination can be found in various formulations marketed under different trade names (some of which include a combination of betahistine, ginkgo biloba, and other ingredients such as piracetam and vinpocetine), depending on the region and manufacturer.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Betahistine acts as a partial H1 receptor agonist and an H3 receptor antagonist in the inner ear and central nervous system, affecting vascular permeability and neurotransmission, and ultimately impacting inner ear fluid balance. Ginkgo biloba’s pharmacodynamics are not fully understood.  Its purported effects include antioxidant activity, improvements in blood flow, and neurotransmitter modulation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Betahistine is readily absorbed after oral administration. It is extensively metabolized in the liver and primarily excreted in the urine. The pharmacokinetics of Ginkgo biloba are complex and not fully elucidated, involving multiple active compounds with varying absorption and metabolism profiles.
- **Mode of Action:** Betahistine’s action at H1 and H3 receptors contributes to vasodilation and improved blood flow in the inner ear.  Ginkgo biloba’s components, including flavonoids and terpenoids, are proposed to work via multiple mechanisms, including free radical scavenging and modulation of neurotransmitters.
- **Elimination:** Betahistine is primarily eliminated through renal excretion following hepatic metabolism. The elimination pathways of Ginkgo biloba components are not entirely clear but likely involve both hepatic and renal routes.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

A common dosage is 24 mg of betahistine and 60 mg of ginkgo biloba administered once or twice daily, often taken with meals.  Dosage and duration of treatment should be determined by the prescribing physician based on individual patient needs.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be needed depending on individual patient characteristics and comorbidities.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose modification may be necessary based on the degree of renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments might be needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Considerations for conditions such as asthma, peptic ulcers, and hypotension are necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The available sources primarily focus on the use of Betahistine + Ginkgo Biloba for Ménière's disease and vertigo. Dosing in other clinical contexts is not well-defined and should be guided by clinical experience and patient-specific factors.
