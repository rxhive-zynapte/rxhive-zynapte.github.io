## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for inflammatory skin disorders complicated by secondary bacterial and/or fungal infections.  

**Pharmacological Classifications:**

* **Corticosteroid:** Betamethasone valerate (provides potent anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive actions)
* **Aminoglycoside Antibiotic:** Neomycin sulfate (offers bactericidal activity against a range of gram-negative and some gram-positive bacteria)
* **Antifungal:** Tolnaftate (exhibits fungistatic properties, primarily targeting dermatophytes)
* **Antibiotic/Antifungal:** Clioquinol (exerts both bacteriostatic and weak antifungal effects)
* **Preservative:** Chlorocresol (prevents microbial growth in the cream formulation)

**Mechanism of Action:**  Betamethasone reduces inflammation. Neomycin disrupts bacterial protein synthesis. Tolnaftate inhibits fungal ergosterol synthesis, disrupting the fungal cell membrane. Clioquinol is believed to act through chelation of trace metals essential for bacterial growth. Chlorocresol acts as a preservative.


## **Alternate Names**

* Quadriderm
* Qwikderm
* Triderm
* Tigboderm
* Betamethasone/Clioquinol Cream (for combinations containing only these two actives)
* Other brand names may exist regionally.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Betamethasone exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by binding to glucocorticoid receptors, modulating gene expression, and ultimately suppressing inflammatory cascades. Neomycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death.  Tolnaftate inhibits fungal ergosterol synthesis, disrupting fungal cell membrane integrity. Clioquinol is believed to act through chelation of trace metals essential for bacterial growth.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Topical absorption of betamethasone can vary depending on skin integrity, application site, and the use of occlusive dressings. Neomycin, clioquinol, and tolnaftate also exhibit limited percutaneous absorption. Metabolism of betamethasone occurs primarily in the liver, and excretion is mainly renal. Neomycin is excreted mostly unchanged by the kidneys.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer to the affected skin area once or twice daily. Treatment duration should typically not exceed four weeks.

#### **Children:** Use in children aged 2 years and older is generally considered safe for short durations under close medical supervision. Apply sparingly to limited areas. Avoid long-term use due to potential systemic absorption and adverse effects like growth retardation and adrenocortical suppression. Do not use on children under 2 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution and for limited periods, monitoring for skin atrophy.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Neomycin can be nephrotoxic if absorbed systemically. Caution is advised, especially with extensive application or compromised skin barrier.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Monitor liver function with prolonged use, especially in patients with pre-existing hepatic conditions.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate on a case-by-case basis.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources do not contain dosage recommendations for specific medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) use, or emergency situations. This combination is intended for topical use on skin infections.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications should be considered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and in the elderly. Prolonged use in children should be avoided.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Burning sensation
* Itching
* Irritation
* Dryness at the application site
* Changes in skin color

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Allergic reactions (rashes, itching, swelling, shortness of breath)
* Increased risk of infection
* Skin atrophy (thinning of the skin)

### **Long-Term Effects**

* Skin atrophy
* Cushingoid features (with extensive use)
* Nephrotoxicity (with systemic absorption of neomycin)
* Ototoxicity (with systemic absorption of neomycin)

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

* Hypersensitivity reactions
* Contact dermatitis



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any of the components
* Primary bacterial, viral (e.g., herpes simplex, varicella), or fungal skin infections (unless complicated by secondary bacterial/fungal infection susceptible to this combination)
* Tuberculosis of the skin
* Rosacea
* Acne vulgaris
* Perioral dermatitis
* Children under 2 years old


## **Drug Interactions**

Clinically significant interactions with topical application are rare. However, concomitant use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, itraconazole) might increase systemic exposure to betamethasone. Concurrent use of other topical corticosteroids should be avoided due to the potential for cumulative effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be limited to small areas and short durations, only if clearly necessary. The safety profile in these populations is not well established. Avoid application to the breast area during lactation.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Multifaceted; anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal actions via various mechanisms.
* **Side Effects:** Local reactions (burning, itching, dryness), skin atrophy, allergic reactions, systemic effects with prolonged/extensive use (Cushingoid features, nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, primary viral/fungal infections, tuberculosis of the skin, rosacea, acne vulgaris, perioral dermatitis, children under 2 years old.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, other topical corticosteroids.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution, limited areas, short durations.
* **Dosage:**  Adults: Thin layer once or twice daily, not exceeding four weeks. Children (2+ years): Sparingly, limited areas, short durations.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Skin condition, signs of infection, evidence of systemic absorption.

## **Popular Combinations**

Not applicable for this combination.

## **Precautions**

* Avoid use on broken skin, large areas, or for extended periods.
* Monitor for signs of local and systemic side effects.
* Use caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
