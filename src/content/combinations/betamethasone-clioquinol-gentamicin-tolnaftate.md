## **Usage**

This combination medication is a topical preparation indicated for inflammatory dermatoses, especially where secondary bacterial and/or fungal infections are present or suspected.  It is prescribed for conditions such as:

* Infected eczema and dermatitis
* Intertrigo
* Tinea infections (e.g., athlete's foot, ringworm)
* Minor infected wounds or burns
* Otitis externa

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Corticosteroid (Betamethasone)
* Antibiotic (Gentamicin)
* Antifungal (Tolnaftate and Clioquinol)


**Mechanism of Action:**  This combination product works through the synergistic action of its components:

* **Betamethasone:**  Provides anti-inflammatory and antipruritic effects by inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators.
* **Gentamicin:**  An aminoglycoside antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis.
* **Tolnaftate:**  Antifungal agent that inhibits ergosterol synthesis, disrupting fungal cell membrane formation.
* **Clioquinol:** Exerts antifungal and antibacterial effects by disrupting cell membrane function.


## **Alternate Names**

* Quadriderm
* Amiderm
* Uniderm
* Polyderm 4
* Quatroderm
* Tigboderm
* Dermitop
* Quadri Mix
* Betamethasone + Gentamicin + Tolnaftate + Iodochlorhydroxyquin
* Betamethasone valerate + Gentamicin sulfate + Tolnaftate + Clioquinol
* ซีโต้-เดิร์ม (Thailand)
* DERMA - 3 (Colombia)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The combined effect of the four components addresses the inflammatory and infectious aspects of dermatological conditions. Betamethasone reduces inflammation and itching, while gentamicin, tolnaftate, and clioquinol combat bacterial and fungal infections.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Primarily topical; systemic absorption is minimal under normal use but can increase with prolonged use, application to large areas, or use of occlusive dressings.
* **Metabolism:** Betamethasone is metabolized primarily in the liver. Gentamicin, tolnaftate, and clioquinol are minimally metabolized when applied topically.
* **Elimination:** Betamethasone metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine and bile.  Gentamicin is excreted renally, while tolnaftate and clioquinol are primarily excreted unchanged in the feces and urine.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin film to the affected area two to three times daily.

#### **Children:** Not recommended for children under 2 years of age. For children over 2 years, use as directed by a physician.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on age and body weight.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments, but use with caution, especially with prolonged application.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Systemic absorption is minimal, but monitor for potential systemic effects with prolonged or extensive use.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Monitor for potential increased systemic levels of betamethasone with prolonged or extensive use.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate the overall clinical picture, particularly in patients with diabetes, as corticosteroids can affect glucose control.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  The dosage for this combination product is not generally adjusted for specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It is designed for topical dermatological use.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be needed based on the severity of the condition and patient response.  For tinea pedis, longer therapy (2-4 weeks) may be required.
