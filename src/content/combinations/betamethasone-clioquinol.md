## **Usage**

Betamethasone + Clioquinol is a topical medication prescribed for inflammatory skin disorders complicated by secondary bacterial and/or fungal infections.  These skin conditions may include:

* Eczema (atopic, discoid, etc.)
* Psoriasis (excluding widespread plaque psoriasis)
* Contact dermatitis
* Seborrheic dermatitis
* Discoid lupus erythematosus
* Insect bites with secondary infection
* Intertrigo (anal and genital)

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Betamethasone: Corticosteroid (potent, topical)
* Clioquinol: Anti-infective (antibacterial and antifungal)

**Mechanism of Action:** Betamethasone reduces inflammation, itching, and vasoconstriction. Clioquinol combats bacterial and fungal infections at the application site.

## **Alternate Names**

* **International and Regional Variations:** Betamethasone valerate + Clioquinol, Betamethasone + Iodochlorhydroxyquin
* **Brand Names:**  Betnovate-C, Barquinol-B,  (Note: Brand names can vary regionally; this list is not exhaustive.)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Betamethasone, a glucocorticoid, binds to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors. This complex modulates gene expression, resulting in decreased production of inflammatory mediators (e.g., prostaglandins, leukotrienes, cytokines). Clioquinol, a halogenated hydroxyquinoline, chelates divalent cations essential for microbial enzyme function, leading to inhibition of bacterial and fungal growth.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Betamethasone's percutaneous absorption varies based on factors like skin integrity, vehicle used, and occlusion.  Absorption is higher in inflamed skin or under occlusion.
* **Metabolism:**  Betamethasone is metabolized primarily in the liver.
* **Elimination:** Mainly renal excretion; some hepatic elimination. Clioquinol is minimally absorbed systemically when used topically.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer to the affected area two or three times daily.  Reduce frequency as the condition improves (once daily or less). Limit treatment courses to a maximum of 5 days when possible.

#### **Children (2 years and older):** Similar to adult dosing but with increased caution due to a higher risk of systemic absorption. Limit treatment courses to a maximum of 5 days when possible. Do not use on children under 2 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Similar to adult dosing but monitor for skin thinning.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution advised, especially with prolonged use.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution advised, especially with prolonged use.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution in patients with diabetes, hypertension, and other conditions that may be exacerbated by corticosteroids.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of betamethasone and clioquinol is not typically indicated for use in situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU care, or emergency settings.  Its primary role is in treating localized skin inflammation with secondary infection.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Avoid prolonged use and high doses, especially in children and the elderly, to minimize systemic absorption and side effects. Adjust the dosage according to the severity of the condition and patient response.  Monitor patients with renal or hepatic impairment closely.
