## **Usage**

Betamethasone + Mupirocin is prescribed for inflammatory skin disorders complicated by bacterial infection.  These include:

*   Eczema (atopic dermatitis) with secondary bacterial infection
*   Psoriasis with secondary bacterial infection
*   Contact dermatitis with secondary bacterial infection
*   Impetigo (a highly contagious bacterial skin infection)
*   Folliculitis (inflammation of hair follicles)
*   Furunculosis (boils)

**Pharmacological Classification:**

*   Betamethasone: Corticosteroid (topical)
*   Mupirocin: Antibiotic (topical)

**Mechanism of Action:** Betamethasone, a potent corticosteroid, provides anti-inflammatory, antipruritic (anti-itch), and vasoconstrictive effects. It works by suppressing the immune response that triggers inflammation, thereby reducing redness, itching, and swelling.  Mupirocin, a topical antibiotic, inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, effectively halting bacterial growth. The combination provides a dual-action approach for treating skin conditions where both inflammation and bacterial infection are present.


## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for the combination product itself.  However, the individual components have other names:

*   **Betamethasone:**  Various esters exist (e.g., betamethasone dipropionate, betamethasone valerate) which are used in different topical formulations.
*   **Mupirocin:** Also known as pseudomonic acid.

**Brand Names:**  BACTREAT-B, Mupin-B (Note: Brand names can vary regionally; this list is not exhaustive)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Betamethasone exerts its anti-inflammatory action by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the skin. This leads to decreased production of inflammatory mediators (like prostaglandins and leukotrienes) and reduced vascular permeability. Mupirocin inhibits bacterial isoleucyl transfer-RNA synthetase, an enzyme essential for bacterial protein synthesis.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Topical application results in minimal systemic absorption of both betamethasone and mupirocin when used as directed on intact skin.

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Betamethasone binds to glucocorticoid receptors. Mupirocin inhibits bacterial isoleucyl transfer-RNA synthetase.

**Elimination pathways:** Primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted via the kidneys (for the small amount that is systemically absorbed).


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer to the affected skin area 2-3 times daily.

#### **Children:** Use in children younger than 12 years of age is not recommended without the careful consideration of a healthcare professional.  Dosage should be determined based on the child's age, weight, and the specific skin condition.
