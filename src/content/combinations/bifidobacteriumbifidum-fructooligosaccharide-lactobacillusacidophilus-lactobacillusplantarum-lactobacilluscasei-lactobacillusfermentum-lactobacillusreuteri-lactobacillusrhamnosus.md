## **Usage**

This combination of probiotics and a prebiotic (fructooligosaccharide) is primarily used to improve digestive health and restore the balance of gut flora. It is indicated for the prevention and treatment of various gastrointestinal issues, including antibiotic-associated diarrhea, infectious diarrhea (such as rotaviral diarrhea), traveler's diarrhea, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  It may also be beneficial for other conditions like eczema and for improving semen parameters in men with varicocele.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Probiotic, Prebiotic (Fructooligosaccharide)
- **Mechanism of Action:** Probiotics work by colonizing the gut and competing with harmful bacteria, thus promoting a healthy gut microbiome. They produce lactic acid, which lowers the pH of the intestine, creating an unfavorable environment for pathogenic bacteria.  Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) act as prebiotics, providing nourishment for the beneficial bacteria, further enhancing their growth and activity in the gut.

## **Alternate Names**

This specific combination does not have a widely recognized international non-proprietary name (INN). It is often referred to as a multi-strain probiotic or probiotic blend.

- **Brand Names:**  This combination is available under various brand names. One example found in the sources is Florita LL. Due to constant changes in the pharmaceutical market, an up-to-date list of all brand names is not feasible.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The probiotics in this formulation exert their effects by competitively excluding pathogenic bacteria, producing antimicrobial substances (like lactic acid and bacteriocins), modulating the immune system, and enhancing the intestinal barrier function.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Orally administered probiotics primarily reside in the gastrointestinal tract. They are not absorbed systemically in significant amounts. The viability of the probiotics is crucial for their efficacy and depends on factors such as gastric pH and bile acid concentration. FOS, being a prebiotic, is not digested by the human host but is fermented by the gut microbiota.
- **Mode of Action:** Probiotics compete for resources and adhesion sites within the gut, limiting the colonization of pathogenic bacteria. They also produce substances like lactic acid and bacteriocins that inhibit the growth of harmful microbes.  FOS selectively promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria in the colon.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Probiotics are eliminated primarily through the feces. The byproducts of FOS fermentation, such as short-chain fatty acids, are absorbed and utilized by the host or further metabolized by the gut microbiota.

## **Dosage**

Dosage varies depending on the product formulation and the specific condition being treated.
