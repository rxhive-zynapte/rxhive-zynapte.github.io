## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the relief of cough and upper respiratory symptoms, including nasal congestion, associated with allergies or the common cold.
- **Pharmacological Classifications:**  Antihistamine (Bilastine), Antitussive (Dextromethorphan Hydrochloride), Nasal Decongestant (Phenylephrine Hydrochloride).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Bilastine acts as a peripheral H1-receptor antagonist, reducing the effects of histamine, a chemical mediator responsible for allergic symptoms. Dextromethorphan hydrochloride suppresses the cough reflex by acting centrally on the cough center in the brain. Phenylephrine hydrochloride acts as a nasal decongestant by constricting blood vessels in the nasal mucosa, reducing swelling and congestion.

## **Alternate Names**
-  Bilastine/Dextromethorphan/Phenylephrine combination.
- **Brand Names:** Alex-BL Syrup, Bisalatin Dexter Syrup, Costus BT Syrup. (Please note that brand names may vary regionally.)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Bilastine selectively blocks peripheral H1 receptors, mitigating the effects of histamine release (itching, sneezing, runny nose). Dextromethorphan suppresses the cough reflex centrally.  Phenylephrine constricts blood vessels in the nasal mucosa, alleviating congestion.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Bilastine:** Well absorbed orally, minimally metabolized, primarily excreted renally.  Food or fruit juice can decrease its absorption.
    - **Dextromethorphan:**  Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6.  Genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6 can influence its effectiveness and potential for adverse events.
    - **Phenylephrine:**  Metabolized by monoamine oxidase in the intestine and liver.
- **Mode of Action:** Bilastine competitively antagonizes histamine at H1 receptors. Dextromethorphan acts on sigma opioid receptors in the central nervous system to suppress cough. Phenylephrine acts on alpha-adrenergic receptors in the nasal mucosa.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Bilastine mainly renal excretion.  Dextromethorphan primarily hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.  Phenylephrine hepatic and intestinal metabolism.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- Typically, 10 mL (containing Bilastine 3.3 mg, Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide 10 mg, and Phenylephrine Hydrochloride 5 mg) every 4-6 hours as needed.  
- Do not exceed 4 doses (40 mL) within a 24-hour period.

#### **Children:**
- **12 years and older:**  Same as adult dosage.
- **6 to under 12 years:**  5 mL every 4-6 hours as needed, not exceeding 4 doses (20 mL) in 24 hours.
- **Under 6 years:** Consult a physician. This combination is generally not recommended for young children.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Start with a lower dose and monitor closely for side effects. Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Bilastine dosage adjustment is generally not necessary. However, caution is advised with Dextromethorphan, and adjustments might be needed depending on the severity of the impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is recommended. Monitor for adverse effects.  Dose adjustments, especially for dextromethorphan, might be necessary based on the degree of impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, or prostatic hypertrophy.  Consult a physician for individualized dosing recommendations.
