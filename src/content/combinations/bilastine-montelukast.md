## **Usage**

Bilastine + Montelukast is prescribed for the treatment of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and asthma.  It is also sometimes used to manage refractory and non-responsive urticaria (hives).  It belongs to the pharmacological classifications of antihistamines (bilastine) and leukotriene receptor antagonists (montelukast). This fixed-dose combination therapy addresses both the early and late phases of allergic responses. Bilastine works by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical released during allergic reactions. Montelukast inhibits leukotrienes, which contribute to inflammation and bronchoconstriction.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for the combination itself.  However, it's marketed under various brand names such as Bilafast-M, Bilaset M, Montek BL, Bilazest M, Bilazap M, Odastin M, Bilacad M, Bilahenz M, Prulastin M, Bilagra M, Billasi M, Bilanta M, Bilachek M, Antegy M, Bilafav M, Bilamed M, and Belatin M.  It is also sometimes known as AllerDuo.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Bilastine is a selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist that doesn't readily cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to fewer central nervous system side effects like drowsiness. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist, specifically CysLT1.  It blocks the binding of leukotrienes, preventing airway constriction and inflammation.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Bilastine is well-absorbed orally and metabolized primarily through hepatic glucuronidation, with a smaller amount undergoing CYP3A4 metabolism. It is excreted mainly in feces and to a lesser extent in urine. Montelukast is also well-absorbed orally, extensively metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, and primarily eliminated through the biliary route with minimal renal excretion.

**Mode of Action:**  Bilastine competitively inhibits histamine binding to H1 receptors, reducing allergic symptoms. Montelukast blocks the CysLT1 receptor, inhibiting the effects of leukotrienes which include bronchoconstriction, mucus secretion, and eosinophil recruitment, thereby reducing inflammation.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Bilastine binds to H1 histamine receptors.  Montelukast binds to and antagonizes CysLT1 receptors.  The combination does not significantly modulate neurotransmitters or inhibit enzymes other than CYP metabolism mentioned previously.

**Elimination Pathways:** Bilastine is excreted primarily in feces through hepatic glucuronidation and some CYP3A4 metabolism. Montelukast is excreted primarily through bile after metabolism by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard dose is one tablet containing 20mg bilastine and 10mg montelukast taken orally once daily, with or without food.  

#### **Children:**

* For children aged 6-11 years weighing at least 20kg: A formulation containing bilastine 10mg + montelukast 4mg per 5ml suspension is available, with the dosage determined by the physician.
