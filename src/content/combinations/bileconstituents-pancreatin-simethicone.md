## **Usage**

This medication is prescribed for pancreatic enzyme deficiency or pancreatic insufficiency. These conditions occur when the pancreas doesn't produce enough enzymes needed for digestion in the small intestine. This leads to indigestion, stomach pain, bloating, and a feeling of fullness.  This drug belongs to the pharmacological classifications of digestive enzymes and antifoaming agents.  It works by providing the missing enzymes (pancreatin and bile constituents) to aid digestion and by reducing gas bubbles (simethicone) to relieve bloating and discomfort.

## **Alternate Names**

While the generic name is Bile constituents + Pancreatin + Simethicone, several brand names exist (e.g., Dyzerax, Nichzyme, Xylase, Enzoset PB, Evanzyme, Ntzyme, Pankreoflat HD, Enzygut Forte).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Pancreatin supplements the deficient pancreatic enzymes (lipase, protease, amylase) enabling the digestion of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. Bile constituents enhance fat emulsification and absorption. Simethicone, an antifoaming agent, reduces the surface tension of gas bubbles, leading to their coalescence and easier passage.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Pancreatin acts locally in the digestive tract with limited systemic absorption. Bile constituents are partially reabsorbed via enterohepatic circulation. Simethicone is not absorbed systemically and is eliminated in the feces.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** One to two tablets or capsules with each meal. Dosage should be individualized based on the patient's condition and response.

#### **Children:**  Dosage for children should be determined by a pediatrician based on weight, age, and specific condition. Close monitoring is essential. For simethicone dosing in children:
* Under 10.9 kg: 20 mg orally after meals and at bedtime as needed. Maximum dose: 240 mg/day.
* Over 10.9 kg: 40 mg orally after meals and at bedtime as needed. Maximum dose: 480 mg/day.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage may need adjustment based on individual needs and digestive function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised. Dose adjustment might be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised. Dose adjustment might be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Conditions like gout, Crohn's disease, and hyperuricemia require careful monitoring and potential dose adjustments.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical situations (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, Emergency Situations) should be determined by the treating physician based on individual patient needs. There are no standardized dosage adjustments specific to these situations. Please note that this might change with future research.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments should be based on individual patient factors like renal or hepatic dysfunction, other medical conditions, and response to therapy. Regular monitoring of symptoms and digestive function is important.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
Nausea, abdominal pain or cramps, diarrhea, constipation, headache, vomiting, bloating, and gas.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Severe abdominal discomfort, frequent/painful urination, joint pain, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), fibrosing colonopathy (with high doses in children).

### **Long-Term Effects**
Long-term use, especially at high doses, can potentially increase the risk of fibrosing colonopathy, especially in children with cystic fibrosis.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Severe allergic reactions require immediate medical attention. Report any unusual or severe side effects to the physician immediately.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to pork protein or any component of the formulation; acute pancreatitis; worsening of chronic pancreatitis; complete blockage of the pancreatic or biliary ducts; gout; stomach or intestinal obstruction; Crohn's disease.


## **Drug Interactions**

Acarbose; miglitol; iron supplements; oral contraceptives; anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin); some medications for type 2 diabetes; hormonal medications (e.g., levothyroxine).  It may also impair the oral absorption of folic acid. Avoid alcohol consumption.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult a physician before using this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Safety during these periods has not been fully established. The potential benefits should be weighed against the potential risks.
