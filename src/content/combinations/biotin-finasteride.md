## **Usage**

Biotin + Finasteride is primarily prescribed for **male pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia)**. Androgenetic alopecia is a common type of hair loss affecting men.  It is characterized by a receding hairline and thinning hair on the crown. The combination of Biotin and Finasteride addresses both nutritional deficiencies and hormonal influences on hair loss. Biotin is categorized as a vitamin supplement, while Finasteride belongs to the class of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors.

Finasteride works by inhibiting the 5-alpha-reductase enzyme, which converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is a hormone that plays a significant role in the miniaturization of hair follicles, leading to hair loss. By reducing DHT levels, Finasteride helps slow down hair loss and promotes hair regrowth.

Biotin, a B vitamin, supports healthy hair growth by promoting keratin production, a protein that forms the structural basis of hair. While Biotin deficiency is rare, supplementation can be beneficial in individuals with marginal biotin status or increased needs.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Biotin + Finasteride" accurately represents the drug's composition, there might not be a universally recognized alternate name for this specific combination. Brand names may vary depending on the manufacturer and geographical location. Some popular brand names containing Finasteride include Propecia (1mg for hair loss) and Proscar (5mg for benign prostatic hyperplasia), and Biotin is often included in multivitamins and hair growth supplements, usually not under a specific brand name.  


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Finasteride inhibits Type II 5α-reductase, thus decreasing DHT levels in the scalp and serum. This reduction in DHT leads to a decrease in prostatic volume and helps reverse the miniaturization of hair follicles. Biotin functions as a coenzyme in carboxylase reactions, facilitating metabolic processes involved in cell growth and keratin production, thereby contributing to healthy hair and skin.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Finasteride is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentration within 1-2 hours. It is metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4 enzymes and excreted primarily through feces and urine. Biotin is absorbed in the small intestine, and excess biotin is excreted in the urine. Biotin does not accumulate in the body.

**Mode of Action:**  Finasteride competitively binds to and inhibits Type II 5α-reductase, reducing the conversion of testosterone to DHT. Biotin enhances the activity of carboxylases, enzymes crucial for fatty acid synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and amino acid metabolism. This contributes to the synthesis of keratin, a key component of hair.

**Elimination Pathways:** Finasteride is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the feces and to a lesser extent in the urine. Biotin, being water-soluble, is primarily excreted in the urine.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Finasteride is typically prescribed at 1 mg per day for androgenetic alopecia. The recommended daily intake for Biotin is 30-100 mcg.  Biotin + Finasteride combination formulations may contain varying dosages of Biotin.

#### **Children:**

Biotin + Finasteride is contraindicated in children under 18 years of age. Finasteride can affect the development of male genitalia in a developing fetus, so it is extremely important that this medication is not handled by pregnant women.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are generally required for elderly patients, but caution should be exercised in those with hepatic or renal impairment.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary depending on the degree of renal impairment.  Creatinine clearance should be monitored.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Finasteride is metabolized in the liver, so caution is advised in patients with hepatic dysfunction.  Liver function tests should be monitored.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution should be exercised in patients with pre-existing prostate cancer, liver or kidney diseases.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of Biotin and Finasteride is not typically used in acute medical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It is primarily intended for long-term management of androgenetic alopecia.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be required in specific cases as detailed above.  Monitoring renal function and liver function tests may be necessary.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Decreased libido
* Erectile dysfunction
* Ejaculation disorders
* Gynecomastia
* Testicular pain


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Allergic reactions (e.g., rash, itching, swelling of lips, face, or tongue)
* Depression


### **Long-Term Effects**

The long-term effects of Finasteride are generally related to sexual function and may persist even after discontinuation of the medication. 


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions and persistent sexual dysfunction should be considered as clinically significant ADRs.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to Finasteride or Biotin
* Women of childbearing potential, pregnant women, and breastfeeding women
* Children
* Prostate cancer



## **Drug Interactions**

* **CYP450 Interactions:** Finasteride is metabolized by CYP3A4, so interactions are possible with drugs that inhibit or induce this enzyme.
* **Commonly prescribed medications:** Interactions are not frequently reported, but it's always best to disclose all medications being used.
* **OTC drugs and supplements:**  Biotin supplementation above recommended dosages can interfere with laboratory tests utilizing biotin-streptavidin technology.
* **Food and lifestyle factors:**  Alcohol consumption may decrease Finasteride absorption.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Finasteride is contraindicated in women of childbearing potential, pregnant women, and breastfeeding women due to the risk of fetal abnormalities.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Finasteride inhibits 5α-reductase, reducing DHT levels; Biotin acts as a coenzyme for carboxylases, promoting keratin production.
* **Side Effects:** Decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation disorders, gynecomastia, testicular pain.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, women of childbearing potential, pregnancy, breastfeeding, children, prostate cancer.
* **Drug Interactions:** Potential interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers; Biotin interference with lab tests.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
* **Dosage:** Finasteride 1mg/day for hair loss, Biotin 30-100mcg/day.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Liver function tests, PSA levels (if being used for enlarged prostate), renal function tests (if needed).


## **Popular Combinations**

Finasteride is sometimes combined with Minoxidil, a topical medication for hair loss.


## **Precautions**

* Monitor liver and renal function as needed.
* Assess PSA levels in patients being treated for BPH.
* Women should not handle crushed or broken Finasteride tablets.
