## **Usage**

This combination of vitamins and minerals is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to address deficiencies and support overall well-being. It is often prescribed for conditions like peripheral neuropathy, general debility, and to support hair, skin, and nail health.  It may also be used to prevent and treat vitamin B7 deficiency. This combination is not classified under a single pharmacological category, as it comprises multiple nutrients with diverse mechanisms.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no single international nonproprietary name (INN) for this combination.  It is often referred to simply as a multivitamin or vitamin and mineral supplement. Brand names can vary depending on the manufacturer, such as Mycomin-Z and Meconerv Z.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Each component of this combination exerts specific effects on the body:

* **Biotin (Vitamin B7):** Essential for cell growth, fatty acid production, and metabolism of fats and amino acids. It plays a role in keratin production, which is crucial for hair, skin, and nail health.
* **Folic Acid (Vitamin B9):** Vital for DNA synthesis, cell division, red blood cell formation, and neural tube development during pregnancy.
* **Lysine:** An essential amino acid crucial for protein synthesis, tissue repair, and immune function.  It is involved in carnitine production, important for energy metabolism.
* **Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B12):** Plays a key role in nerve function, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis. It's involved in myelin production, protecting nerve fibers.
* **Niacinamide (Vitamin B3):**  Supports skin health, reduces inflammation, and has antioxidant properties.
* **Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol):** Essential for calcium absorption, promoting bone health, and also plays a role in immune function.
* **Zinc:** Supports immune function, wound healing, and cell growth. It also contributes to hair growth and prevents hair loss.

**Pharmacokinetics:** 

Absorption, metabolism, and excretion vary for each ingredient. Biotin, folic acid, niacinamide, and vitamin B12 are water-soluble and generally excreted in the urine.  Vitamin D3 is fat-soluble and stored in the liver and fatty tissues. Zinc is absorbed in the small intestine. Methylcobalamin is converted into active coenzyme forms, adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin, involved in various metabolic reactions.  Lysine is metabolized in the liver. Specific receptor interactions and elimination pathways vary among the components.
