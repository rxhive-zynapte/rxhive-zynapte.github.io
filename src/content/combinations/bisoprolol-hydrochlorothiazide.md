## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Bisoprolol + Hydrochlorothiazide is primarily prescribed for the management of hypertension (high blood pressure).  Lowering blood pressure helps reduce the risk of complications such as stroke, heart attack, and kidney failure.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This medication is a combination of two drug classes:
    - Bisoprolol: Beta-1 adrenergic receptor blocker (Cardio-selective beta blocker)
    - Hydrochlorothiazide: Thiazide diuretic

- **Mechanism of Action:**
    - Bisoprolol selectively blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, decreasing heart rate and the force of heart contractions, thereby lowering blood pressure.
    - Hydrochlorothiazide increases the excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys, reducing blood volume and further contributing to blood pressure reduction.  The combination offers a synergistic effect in managing hypertension.

## **Alternate Names**

- **Generic Name:** Bisoprolol fumarate/hydrochlorothiazide
- **Brand Name:** Ziac

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Bisoprolol reduces cardiac output and inhibits renin release, which leads to vasodilation and lowered blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide reduces blood volume through its diuretic action, directly lowering blood pressure.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Both drugs are well-absorbed orally. Food does not significantly affect the absorption of bisoprolol.
    - **Metabolism:** Bisoprolol is metabolized in the liver.
    - **Elimination:**  Bisoprolol is eliminated through both renal and hepatic routes. Hydrochlorothiazide is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.

- **Mode of Action:** Bisoprolol exerts its effects by competitively binding to beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart and vascular smooth muscle, preventing the binding of catecholamines such as adrenaline. Hydrochlorothiazide inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron, promoting natriuresis (sodium excretion) and diuresis (increased urine output).


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial: 2.5 mg bisoprolol/6.25 mg hydrochlorothiazide orally once daily.
- The dosage may be increased every two weeks based on blood pressure response.
- Maximum: 20 mg bisoprolol/12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide orally once daily.
- Administer the dose at the same time each day, preferably in the morning.

#### **Children:**

- The safety and efficacy of bisoprolol + hydrochlorothiazide have not been established in children.


#### **Special Cases:**


- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate therapy with a low dose and titrate cautiously, as elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of the drug, especially if they have impaired renal or hepatic function.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be necessary.  Use with caution in severe renal impairment.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments may be necessary.  Use with caution in severe hepatic dysfunction.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**
    - Diabetes: Monitor blood glucose levels closely, as bisoprolol may mask symptoms of hypoglycemia.
    - Asthma/COPD: Use with caution, as bisoprolol may exacerbate bronchospasm.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  

This combination is specifically indicated for hypertension management and does not have specific dosing recommendations for scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or emergency situations. For such situations, appropriate hemodynamic management may involve other medications and interventions.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on patient-specific factors, including renal or hepatic impairment, other medical conditions, and concomitant medications.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Dizziness, lightheadedness
- Fatigue, weakness
- Diarrhea, nausea
- Headache
- Cough

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
- Hypotension (low blood pressure)
- Worsening heart failure
- Electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hyponatremia)
- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Electrolyte disturbances
- Worsening of glucose control in diabetes
- Increased risk of skin cancer (hydrochlorothiazide)

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Angioedema (rare but serious swelling)
- Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome)
- Pancreatitis
- Liver damage


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to bisoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide, or sulfonamides
- Cardiogenic shock
- Second- or third-degree heart block
- Severe sinus bradycardia
- Severe heart failure
- Anuria (kidney failure)

## **Drug Interactions**

- Other antihypertensives (additive hypotensive effect)
- Calcium channel blockers (may exacerbate bradycardia or hypotension)
- Digoxin (increased risk of bradycardia)
- Insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents (masked hypoglycemia)
- Lithium (increased lithium levels)
- NSAIDs (reduced antihypertensive effect)
- Corticosteroids (reduced antihypertensive effect)


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Bisoprolol + Hydrochlorothiazide is generally not recommended during pregnancy. Use only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Thiazides can cause fetal harm. 
- **Breastfeeding:** Hydrochlorothiazide passes into breast milk.  It is unknown if bisoprolol passes into breast milk.  Breastfeeding is generally not recommended while taking this medication. 


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Bisoprolol: Beta-1 blocker, reduces heart rate and cardiac output. Hydrochlorothiazide: Thiazide diuretic, reduces blood volume.
- **Side Effects:** Dizziness, fatigue, nausea, headache, electrolyte disturbances, bradycardia.
- **Contraindications:** Heart block, severe bradycardia, severe heart failure, anuria.
- **Drug Interactions:** Other antihypertensives, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, insulin, lithium, NSAIDs, corticosteroids.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Not recommended.
- **Dosage:** Start with 2.5mg/6.25mg once daily, titrate to a maximum of 20mg/12.5mg.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, heart rate, electrolytes (especially potassium), renal function, blood glucose (in diabetics).

## **Popular Combinations**

Bisoprolol + Hydrochlorothiazide is itself a popular combination. Other antihypertensives may be added if needed.

## **Precautions**

- Monitor for electrolyte imbalances, especially hypokalemia.
- Monitor blood glucose in diabetic patients.
- Use cautiously in patients with asthma or COPD.
- Avoid abrupt discontinuation, which can exacerbate angina or cause myocardial infarction.
- Advise patients about potential dizziness and orthostatic hypotension.
