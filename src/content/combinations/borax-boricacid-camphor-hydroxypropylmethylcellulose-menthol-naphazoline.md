## **Usage**

This combination of drugs is primarily used as an ophthalmic solution for symptomatic relief of minor eye irritation, redness, and discomfort caused by allergies, dryness, or other environmental factors.  It is not intended to treat infections.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination includes several drug classes:
    - Naphazoline: Decongestant, Vasoconstrictor, Alpha-adrenergic agonist
    - Boric Acid & Borax: Antiseptic, buffering agent
    - Camphor & Menthol: Counterirritants, providing a cooling sensation
    - Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose: Lubricant, viscosity enhancer

- **Mechanism of Action:** Naphazoline acts as a vasoconstrictor, reducing redness and swelling in the eye. Boric acid and borax provide mild antiseptic action and act as a buffer, helping maintain the solution's pH. Menthol and camphor produce a cooling sensation, relieving itching and discomfort. Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acts as a lubricant and helps the solution spread evenly across the eye's surface.


## **Alternate Names**

There is no single international nonproprietary name (INN) for this combination product.  It is often referred to by the names of its individual components.

- **Brand Names:** Ocurest Plus, Napzol Plus, I Boric Eye Drops (and possibly others depending on the region and manufacturer).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Naphazoline stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors in the blood vessels of the conjunctiva, causing vasoconstriction. This reduces blood flow, alleviating redness and swelling. Boric acid and borax have weak antiseptic properties and help maintain the solution's pH. Menthol and camphor activate cold receptors, creating a cooling sensation that counteracts itching and irritation.  Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose increases the viscosity of the solution and lubricates the ocular surface.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Naphazoline is absorbed locally in the eye.  Systemic absorption is minimal with topical application. The other components are also minimally absorbed.  Elimination pathways for naphazoline are not well-defined following topical ophthalmic use.

- **Mode of Action:** Naphazoline acts as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, specifically targeting alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the ocular blood vessels.

- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Naphazoline directly binds to and activates alpha-adrenergic receptors, mimicking the effects of norepinephrine and epinephrine. This leads to vasoconstriction.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Instill 1-2 drops in the affected eye(s) every 3-4 hours as needed.  Do not exceed recommended dosage.

#### **Children:**  Consult a pediatrician before use in children. Safety and efficacy in children have not been fully established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution. Monitor for potential systemic effects like increased blood pressure.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Use with caution.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, or narrow-angle glaucoma.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU.  Its use is primarily for symptomatic relief of minor eye irritation.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary in elderly patients or those with certain medical conditions. Always follow the physician's recommendations.
