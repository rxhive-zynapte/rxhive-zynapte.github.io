      Can these eye drops be used with contact lenses?**


      **A:**  Some brands may be compatible with contact lenses.  However, it's
      generally recommended to remove contact lenses before instilling the drops
      and wait 15-20 minutes before reinserting them. It's essential to consult
      the product packaging and/or a physician or pharmacist for specific
      instructions regarding contact lens use.  Some formulations may contain
      benzalkonium chloride, which can be absorbed by soft contact lenses and
      cause discoloration or irritation.

## **Usage**

This ophthalmic solution is prescribed primarily for the treatment of dry eye syndrome (DES) or keratoconjunctivitis sicca. It acts as a lubricant, offering temporary relief from burning, irritation, and discomfort associated with dry eyes.  It can also be used for lubricating artificial eyes and hard contact lenses, and to protect the cornea during certain ophthalmic procedures. Its pharmacological classification is a lubricant and demulcent.

The mechanism of action involves Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) increasing tear film viscosity, improving its stability, and reducing evaporation. Borax and boric acid help maintain a pH similar to natural tears, and potassium chloride and sodium chloride ensure isotonicity of the solution.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is commonly known as Artificial Tears, Lubricant Eye Drops, or Hypromellose Eye Drops.  Some brand names include Moisol, Freshkon, and Lubitina Plus.  A more general term for similar formulations is Ophthalmic Demulcent Solution.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** HPMC lubricates the ocular surface, thus minimizing friction and discomfort.  Borax and boric acid buffer the solution to maintain a pH compatible with the ocular surface. Potassium and sodium chloride maintain isotonicity, preventing osmotic stress to the ocular surface cells.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Topical administration results in minimal systemic absorption. The components are eliminated primarily through tear drainage.

**Mode of Action:** HPMC, a viscous polymer, increases the viscosity of the tear film, improving its stability and reducing tear evaporation.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** This ophthalmic solution does not exhibit receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation. Its therapeutic action is primarily physical, enhancing lubrication and maintaining a healthy tear film.

**Elimination Pathways:**  The components of the eye drops are primarily eliminated via tear drainage, with negligible systemic absorption.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Instill 1-2 drops into the affected eye(s) as needed, typically up to 3-4 times per day, or as directed by a physician.

#### **Children:** The dosage for children is generally the same as for adults, although a physician should be consulted before administration, particularly for infants and young children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustment is usually necessary.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustment is needed, given negligible systemic absorption.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustment is needed, given negligible systemic absorption.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  No specific adjustments are typically required unless the comorbid condition directly affects ocular health. In such cases, consult an ophthalmologist.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The standard dosage of 1-2 drops as needed (up to 3-4 times/day or as directed by the physician) applies across various clinical situations, including intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency scenarios.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are not generally needed.  If symptoms do not improve with regular use, an ophthalmologist should be consulted.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Temporary blurred vision
- Mild burning or stinging upon instillation
- Eye irritation (rare)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (e.g., itching, redness, swelling) - discontinue use and consult a physician immediately.

### **Long-Term Effects**

No long-term adverse effects have been reported with this combination of ingredients.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs are rare. If any unusual reactions occur, discontinue use and seek medical advice.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.

## **Drug Interactions**

HPMC can potentially prolong the contact time of other ophthalmic medications, possibly increasing their effects.  Consult a physician if using other eye drops concurrently.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Limited data is available on the use of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Due to minimal systemic absorption from topical ophthalmic administration, the risk is considered low.  However, it is advisable to consult a physician if pregnant or breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** HPMC lubricates; borax/boric acid buffers pH; sodium/potassium chloride maintains isotonicity.
- **Side Effects:** Blurred vision, burning/stinging, eye irritation (rare).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.
