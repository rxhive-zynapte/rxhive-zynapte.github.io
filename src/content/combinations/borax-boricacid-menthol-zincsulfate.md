## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as an ophthalmic solution for minor eye irritations such as redness, burning, itching, and discomfort caused by dryness, wind, dust, sun, smoke, air pollutants, or close work.  It may also provide relief from mild symptoms associated with conjunctivitis. It is classified as an antiseptic and astringent.

## **Alternate Names**

Opticure Eye Drops, New Ocurest Sterile Eye Drop

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Boric acid and Borax:** These ingredients act as mild antiseptics, maintaining the solution's pH balance and potentially exhibiting some antifungal properties at high concentrations. Borax may also help retain moisture, offering relief from dryness.
* **Zinc sulfate:** This acts as an astringent, causing tissue constriction and reducing inflammation. It may support the eyeâ€™s natural healing process.
* **Menthol:** Provides a cooling effect, relieving itching and discomfort, and exhibiting antipruritic and analgesic properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

Limited information is available on the pharmacokinetics of this specific ophthalmic combination. However, it's known that boric acid is absorbed after ingestion and from open wounds but has limited skin absorption.  When applied as eye drops, systemic absorption is expected to be minimal. Boric acid is primarily excreted renally.  Zinc sulfate's systemic absorption from eye drops is expected to be negligible.
