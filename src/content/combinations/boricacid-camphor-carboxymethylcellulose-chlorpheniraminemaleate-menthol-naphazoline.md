## **Usage**

This combination medication was primarily used as an ophthalmic solution for symptomatic relief of allergic conjunctivitis and eye irritation.  This fixed-dose combination has been banned in India. The information below is provided for historical context and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for use.

It addressed various aspects of ocular discomfort:

* **Naphazoline:**  A vasoconstrictor, it reduces redness and swelling.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An antihistamine, it relieves itching and other allergic symptoms.
* **Boric Acid:** An antiseptic and buffering agent.
* **Carboxymethylcellulose:** A lubricant providing relief from dryness.
* **Menthol and Camphor:** Produce a cooling sensation.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Decongestant, antihistamine, lubricant, antiseptic.


## **Alternate Names**

There's no universally recognized non-proprietary name. It's often identified by its components. Some brand names have included "Geezol Plus Eye Drops."  Regional variations existed before the ban.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Naphazoline constricts conjunctival blood vessels, reducing redness and edema. Chlorpheniramine maleate competitively antagonizes histamine H1 receptors, mitigating allergic manifestations. Carboxymethylcellulose lubricates the ocular surface. Menthol and camphor provide a cooling sensation. Boric acid acts as a mild antiseptic and buffer.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Information on the combined formulation's pharmacokinetics is limited.  Individual components have distinct absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles. Naphazoline, when applied topically, has minimal systemic absorption. Chlorpheniramine, though primarily topical, can have some systemic absorption.  Boric acid, camphor, and menthol can also be absorbed systemically after topical ocular administration.

**Mode of Action:** Naphazoline acts on alpha-adrenergic receptors in the conjunctiva. Chlorpheniramine blocks the action of histamine at H1 receptors.
