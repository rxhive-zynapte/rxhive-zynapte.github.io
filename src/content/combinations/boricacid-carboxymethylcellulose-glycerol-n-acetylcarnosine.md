## **Usage**

This ophthalmic solution is primarily prescribed for the treatment of dry eye syndrome.  It provides relief from symptoms such as dryness, burning, irritation, and discomfort by lubricating the ocular surface. It may also be used to alleviate symptoms associated with other minor eye irritations or to support overall eye health. While some sources suggest potential benefits for cataracts based on the antioxidant properties of n-acetylcarnosine, more research is needed to confirm this specific use.  It belongs to the pharmacological class of eye lubricants or artificial tears.

The mechanism of action involves the synergistic effects of its components: carboxymethylcellulose and glycerol act as lubricants, mimicking natural tears; n-acetylcarnosine functions as an antioxidant, potentially offering protection from oxidative damage; and boric acid acts as a buffer, helping maintain the solution's pH.

## **Alternate Names**

There isn't a universally recognized alternate name for this specific combination. However, it may be referred to generally as "lubricant eye drops" or "artificial tears." Brand names under which similar formulations are marketed include Aquanac, Oxytears, Oxycool, and Brite.  

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Carboxymethylcellulose and glycerol lubricate the ocular surface, providing a soothing and moisturizing effect. N-acetylcarnosine acts as an antioxidant, protecting ocular tissues from oxidative stress. Boric acid helps maintain the physiological pH of the solution.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The primary action of this combination is topical. Systemic absorption is minimal following ophthalmic administration.

**Mode of Action:**  Carboxymethylcellulose and glycerol increase the viscosity of the tear film, improving its stability and reducing tear evaporation. N-acetylcarnosine scavenges free radicals, reducing oxidative damage to ocular tissues. Boric acid maintains a stable pH environment that is compatible with the eye.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** This combination does not have any known direct effects on receptors, enzymes, or neurotransmitters in the eye.

**Elimination Pathways:** Due to minimal systemic absorption, the components are primarily eliminated through tear drainage.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  The typical dosage is 1-2 drops instilled into the affected eye(s) four times daily, or as directed by the physician.

#### **Children:**  Use in children should be under the supervision of a pediatrician or ophthalmologist. The dosage may be adjusted based on the child's age and the severity of symptoms.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are typically required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustments are needed for topical ophthalmic use.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific dose adjustments are needed for topical ophthalmic use.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Patients with conditions like diabetes or cardiovascular disease should be monitored, as carnosine may have potential effects on blood sugar and blood pressure, although this is more relevant to systemic administration.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations is generally for ocular lubrication and protection, as needed. Dosage should be determined by the physician based on individual patient needs.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are generally made based on the severity of dry eye symptoms and individual patient response.


## **Side Effects**
