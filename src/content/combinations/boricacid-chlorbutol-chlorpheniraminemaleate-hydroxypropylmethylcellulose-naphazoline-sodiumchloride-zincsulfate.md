## **Usage**

This combination is prescribed for the temporary relief of minor eye irritations, such as redness, discomfort, burning, and itching, often associated with allergies or exposure to irritants like pollen, dust, or smoke.  It is also used to relieve dryness of the eye.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination includes several classes of drugs:
    - **Decongestant:** Naphazoline
    - **Antihistamine:** Chlorpheniramine maleate
    - **Lubricant:** Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose
    - **Astringent:** Zinc sulfate
    - **Antiseptic:** Boric Acid and Chlorbutol


- **Mechanism of Action:** This ophthalmic solution works through multiple mechanisms:
    - Naphazoline constricts blood vessels in the eye, reducing redness.
    - Chlorpheniramine maleate blocks histamine receptors, relieving itching and allergic reactions.
    - Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose lubricates the eye surface, providing relief from dryness and irritation.
    - Zinc sulfate acts as an astringent.
    - Boric acid and Chlorbutol act as mild antiseptics.



## **Alternate Names**

No specific alternate names exist for this precise combination of ingredients.  However, it is often referred to as an "ophthalmic decongestant and antihistamine solution."  Several brand names are available, such as Zoline and Redif.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The combined effects of the ingredients provide symptomatic relief from eye irritation and redness. Naphazoline, as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, constricts conjunctival blood vessels, thereby reducing redness. Chlorpheniramine maleate, an H1 receptor antagonist, counteracts the effects of histamine, mitigating allergic symptoms like itching and watering. Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, a lubricant, soothes the eye surface. Zinc sulfate acts as an astringent, while Boric Acid and Chlorbutol serve as mild antiseptics.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Information on the pharmacokinetics of this specific combination is limited. However, ophthalmic administration primarily leads to local effects in the eye, with minimal systemic absorption.
