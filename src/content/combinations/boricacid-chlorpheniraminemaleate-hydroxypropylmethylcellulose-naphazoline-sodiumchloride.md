## **Usage**

This ophthalmic solution is prescribed for the temporary relief of redness, itching, swelling, and watering of the eyes associated with allergic conjunctivitis and minor eye irritations. It also provides relief from burning and irritation due to dryness.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This combination product includes:

* **Naphazoline:** Decongestant, Vasoconstrictor
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Antihistamine
* **Boric Acid:** Antiseptic
* **Sodium Chloride:** Isotonic agent
* **Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose:** Lubricant

**Mechanism of Action:**  The combined effects of the components in this solution alleviate the symptoms of allergic eye disease by targeting different aspects of the inflammatory response. Naphazoline constricts conjunctival blood vessels, reducing redness and swelling. Chlorpheniramine blocks the action of histamine, a chemical mediator responsible for itching, watering, and other allergic symptoms. Boric acid acts as a mild antiseptic. Sodium chloride maintains the solution's isotonicity, ensuring compatibility with ocular tissues. Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose is a lubricant that increases the solution's viscosity, providing a soothing effect, prolonging contact time with the eye, and enhancing drug delivery.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for this specific drug combination. However, it's marketed under various brand names such as Zoneph Eye Drop, Redif Ophthalmic Solution, Borizol Eye Drop, Kaytears Plus, and Trikool Eye Drop. Regional variations in the name may exist.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Naphazoline:** Stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors in the conjunctiva, causing vasoconstriction, which reduces redness and swelling.
* **Chlorpheniramine:**  Antagonizes histamine H1 receptors, relieving itching, watering, and other allergic symptoms.
* **Boric Acid:** Mild antiseptic action.
* **Sodium Chloride:**  Maintains isotonicity.
* **Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose:** Lubricates and soothes the eye, prolonging the medication's contact time.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Topical ophthalmic administration results in minimal systemic absorption of naphazoline and chlorpheniramine. The drugs are primarily eliminated through metabolism and renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**
