## **Usage**

This ophthalmic solution is primarily prescribed for bacterial eye infections (e.g., conjunctivitis, blepharitis) and ocular allergies.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Antibiotic (Sulphacetamide)
* Antihistamine (Chlorpheniramine Maleate)
* Antiseptic (Boric Acid, Zinc Sulfate)
* Lubricant (Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose)
* Isotonic Agent (Sodium Chloride)


**Mechanism of Action:**

This combination medication works through the synergistic action of its components:  Sulphacetamide inhibits bacterial growth, Chlorpheniramine Maleate reduces allergic reactions, Boric Acid and Zinc Sulfate provide antiseptic action, Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose lubricates the eye, and Sodium Chloride maintains isotonicity.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination does not have a widely recognized single alternate name. It is often referred to by its component names or by brand names like Tekmide. Regional variations may also exist.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Sulphacetamide:** Inhibits bacterial dihydropteroate synthase, disrupting folic acid synthesis and impeding bacterial growth (bacteriostatic effect).
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Antagonizes histamine H1 receptors, reducing ocular allergic manifestations (itching, redness, watering).
* **Boric Acid/Zinc Sulfate:** Exert antiseptic and astringent effects, soothing eye irritation.
* **Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose:** Enhances tear film viscosity, prolonging drug contact time with the ocular surface.
* **Sodium Chloride:** Maintains physiological osmotic balance.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily topical action; limited systemic absorption. Sulphacetamide and Boric Acid can be absorbed systemically.  Elimination pathways are primarily renal.

**Mode of Action:**  See pharmacodynamics above.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Instill 1–2 drops in the affected eye(s) every 4–6 hours, or as directed by a physician.

#### **Children:**

Use with caution in children. Consult a pediatrician or ophthalmologist for appropriate dosing based on the child's age and weight.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific adjustments are typically necessary, but close monitoring for adverse effects is advised.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use cautiously. Dosage adjustment might be required due to systemic absorption potential of boric acid and sulfacetamide.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically recommended, but monitor for adverse reactions.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate on a case-by-case basis, considering potential drug interactions and disease-specific factors.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specialized clinical settings should be guided by individual patient needs and clinical judgment. The standard dosage recommendations generally apply.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be necessary for patients with renal/hepatic impairment and other relevant medical conditions. Consider patient-specific factors like age, weight, and concurrent medications.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Transient local irritation, burning, stinging, or blurred vision.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe allergic reactions (e.g., angioedema, anaphylaxis), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (rare).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

With prolonged use, potential for secondary infections or development of resistant bacterial strains.  

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any sign of hypersensitivity or severe local reaction necessitates immediate discontinuation and medical evaluation.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to sulfonamides or any component of the formulation.

## **Drug Interactions**

Sulphacetamide can potentiate the effects of anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin).  Silver preparations are incompatible with sulphacetamide.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Safety during these periods has not been fully established.  Consider the potential benefits versus risks.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Combined antibiotic, antihistamine, antiseptic, lubricant, and isotonic action.
* **Side Effects:** Local irritation, rare serious allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Sulfonamide hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, silver preparations.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use cautiously.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 1–2 drops in the affected eye(s) every 4–6 hours. Pediatric dosing requires specialist consultation.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Observe for local reactions and signs of hypersensitivity.

## **Popular Combinations**

This combination itself represents a frequently used formulation in ophthalmology. No specific additional combinations are commonly recommended.


## **Precautions**

Evaluate patient history for allergies, relevant comorbidities (renal/hepatic impairment), and concurrent medications.  Exercise caution in pregnant/breastfeeding patients, children, and the elderly. Advise patients about potential temporary blurred vision and its impact on activities requiring visual acuity.
