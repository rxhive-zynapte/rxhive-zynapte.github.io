## **Usage**

This ophthalmic solution is prescribed for the temporary relief of symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis, such as redness, itching, watering, swelling, burning or stinging sensation, and discomfort caused by dryness. It can also provide relief from minor eye irritation caused by environmental factors like wind, sun, dust, smoke, air pollutants, and close work.

**Pharmacological Classification**: This is a combination product containing:

* **Decongestant (Naphazoline):** Narrows blood vessels in the eye to decrease redness and swelling.
* **Antihistamine (Chlorpheniramine Maleate):** Blocks the action of histamine, reducing itching, watering, and other allergic symptoms.
* **Lubricant (Methylcellulose):** Moisturizes the eyes, relieving dryness and discomfort.
* **Antiseptic (Boric Acid and Zinc Sulfate):** Prevents the growth of microorganisms, providing relief from irritation and redness. Zinc sulfate also acts as an astringent, further reducing redness.

## **Alternate Names**

Some alternate names and brand names include: Allerdrop, Andre, I-Top DPS, Imaze Eye Drop, Mezol Eye Drops, MICROSOL, Naifa, NAPPO-ZER, NCZ, Nefacool Eye Drops, Persil Eye Drops, Zetex-O, Zincula, Zoneph, Zoline Eye, Zoline Plus.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics**:

* **Naphazoline:** Acts as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, constricting conjunctival blood vessels, leading to decreased redness and swelling.
* **Chlorpheniramine:** An H1-receptor antagonist, blocking histamine's effects, reducing itching, watering, and other allergic manifestations.
* **Methylcellulose:** Increases tear film viscosity, providing lubrication and soothing irritated eyes.
* **Boric Acid and Zinc Sulfate:** Act as antiseptics and astringents, reducing microbial growth and redness.

**Pharmacokinetics**:

* **Absorption:** Primarily absorbed through the conjunctiva, with limited systemic absorption.
* **Metabolism and Elimination:**  The metabolic pathways and elimination routes for this combination product when used ophthalmically are not clearly defined in current research.  Given minimal systemic absorption, the metabolic burden and elimination through renal or hepatic routes are expected to be low.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Instill 1-2 drops in the affected eye(s) up to four times daily.

#### **Children:**

Use only if prescribed by a doctor. Dosage will depend on age and weight. Pediatric safety considerations include careful monitoring for potential side effects, especially drowsiness and central nervous system effects. Children under 6 should generally not use this medication without direct physician supervision.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution. Monitor for systemic side effects, especially cardiovascular effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Monitor for potential adverse effects.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Monitor for potential adverse effects.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use cautiously in patients with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism. Close monitoring is recommended.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  This medication is not typically used in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its use is primarily limited to outpatient management of allergic conjunctivitis and minor eye irritation.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on patient response and the severity of symptoms. Always follow the prescribing physician's recommendations.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Burning or stinging sensation in the eyes

* Eye pain
* Worsening redness/itching/swelling in or around the eyes
* Dizziness, nausea, sweating, drowsiness, weakness

### **Long-Term Effects**

Prolonged use can lead to rebound congestion, where the blood vessels become more dilated than before, potentially worsening redness and swelling. Overuse may damage blood vessels in the eye.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) are rare but require immediate medical intervention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication.
* Angle-closure glaucoma.
* Concurrent use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).


## **Drug Interactions**

* MAOIs can potentiate the effects of naphazoline, leading to a hypertensive crisis.

* Systemic antihistamines or decongestants may have additive effects.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
