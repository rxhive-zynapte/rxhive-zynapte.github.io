## **Usage**

This ophthalmic solution is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of allergic eye diseases. It alleviates redness, itching, burning, swelling, and watering of the eyes caused by allergens like pollen, pet dander, dust mites, and other environmental irritants.  It also offers relief from minor eye irritations and dryness.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing:

* **Chlorpheniramine maleate:** Antihistamine (H1 receptor antagonist)
* **Naphazoline:** Decongestant (alpha-adrenergic agonist)
* **Zinc sulfate monohydrate:** Astringent
* **Boric acid:** Antiseptic

**Mechanism of Action:**  The combined action of its components provides relief: Chlorpheniramine blocks histamine action, naphazoline constricts blood vessels to reduce redness and swelling, zinc sulfate acts as an astringent reducing swelling, and boric acid acts as a mild antiseptic.


## **Alternate Names**

This combination is marketed under various brand names, including Allercool, Borosol, Eyecon, Imaze, Mil, Optihist, and Zecool Eye Drops.  Andre Ophthalmic Solution is another recognized name. Other names for the combination include Boric Acid + Chlorpheniramine + Naphazoline + Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate Eye Drop, and Naphazoline+methylcellulose+boric Acid+zinc Sulfate+chlorpheniramine Maleate.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The four ingredients work synergistically. Chlorpheniramine maleate antagonizes H1 receptors, mitigating histamine's effects. Naphazoline hydrochloride activates alpha-adrenergic receptors, leading to vasoconstriction and reduced redness. Zinc sulfate monohydrate exerts astringent effects, while boric acid provides antiseptic action.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily administered as eye drops, limiting systemic absorption. While some naphazoline may be absorbed systemically, the amount is generally low.


**Mode of Action:** Chlorpheniramine competitively inhibits histamine binding to H1 receptors. Naphazoline stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors in the vascular smooth muscle of the conjunctiva, causing vasoconstriction. Zinc sulfate and boric acid cause a local astringent and antiseptic effect.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily eliminated through renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 1-2 drops in the affected eye(s) every 4-6 hours, not exceeding 8 drops per eye per day.

#### **Children:**  Use only as directed by a physician. Dosage is adjusted based on age and weight.

#### **Special Cases:**
* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution, starting with a lower dose and monitoring for adverse effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dose adjustments may be required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dose adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use cautiously in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, hypertension, heart disease, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, or difficulty urinating. Dosage adjustments may be required.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of this combination in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations is generally not indicated. Its primary use is for temporary relief of allergic conjunctivitis symptoms.


### **Dosage Adjustments**
Adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient response and tolerability. Consider renal or hepatic function and other comorbid conditions when determining the appropriate dose.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**
Burning or stinging sensation in the eyes, blurred vision, dryness of the eyes, dilated pupils.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Eye pain, vision changes, worsening redness/itching/swelling, dizziness, nausea, sweating, drowsiness, weakness, nervousness, headache, decrease in body temperature, irregular heartbeat. Severe allergic reactions (rash, itching/swelling, severe dizziness, trouble breathing) are rare but require immediate medical attention.


### **Long-Term Effects**
Prolonged naphazoline use can cause rebound congestion (worsening redness and swelling). Long-term use is generally not recommended.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Severe allergic reactions requiring immediate medical attention.



## **Contraindications**
Hypersensitivity to any component, narrow-angle glaucoma, severe cardiovascular disease, and concomitant use of MAO inhibitors.


## **Drug Interactions**
Other ophthalmic medications (maintain a 5-minute interval between applications), MAO inhibitors (avoid concomitant use), beta-blockers (may enhance naphazoline's systemic effects).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
Consult a physician before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding as the safety profile is not fully established.
