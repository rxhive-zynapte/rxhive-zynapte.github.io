## **Usage**

Boric acid + ciprofloxacin otic suspension is prescribed for the treatment of specific bacterial ear infections.  Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, targets gram-negative bacteria like *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and gram-positive bacteria like *Staphylococcus aureus*. Boric acid acts as a drying agent and antiseptic, creating an acidic environment unfavorable for microbial growth. This combination is particularly effective against susceptible bacteria in acute otitis externa (outer ear infection) in patients aged six months and older, and acute otitis media (middle ear infection) in patients aged six months and older with tympanostomy tubes (ear tubes).  Its pharmacological classifications include antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) and antiseptic (boric acid). Ciprofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, essential enzymes for bacterial DNA replication and repair, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination drug is often referred to as ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone otic suspension or ciprofloxacin-dexamethasone otic. Common brand names include Ciprodex and Cetraxal. Note: Some sources mention a combination of ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone with boric acid listed as an inactive ingredient. This information focuses on the combination of boric acid and ciprofloxacin where both are active ingredients, while also acknowledging the existence of the ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone combination containing boric acid as an inactive ingredient.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ciprofloxacin exerts its bactericidal effect by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. This action disrupts DNA replication and repair in susceptible bacteria, ultimately leading to cell death. Boric acid works by creating an acidic environment that inhibits the growth of many microorganisms and helps dry the ear canal.

**Pharmacokinetics:** When administered as ear drops, the systemic absorption of both ciprofloxacin and boric acid is minimal, reducing the risk of systemic side effects. The small amount absorbed is metabolized by the liver and primarily excreted by the kidneys.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**  
#### **Adults and Children (≥ 6 months for AOE, ≥ 6 months with Tympanostomy tubes for AOM):**  

- **Acute Otitis Externa (AOE):** Four drops instilled into the affected ear twice daily for seven days.
- **Acute Otitis Media (AOM) with Tympanostomy Tubes:** Four drops instilled into the affected ear twice daily for seven days.

**Administration:**
1. Warm the ear drops by holding the bottle in your hand for 1-2 minutes.
2. Shake the bottle well.
3. The patient should lie with the affected ear upward.
4. Instill the prescribed number of drops.
5. Maintain this position for 60 seconds to facilitate penetration.


#### **Special Cases:**  
Since systemic absorption is minimal, dosage adjustments for elderly patients, patients with renal impairment, patients with hepatic dysfunction, or patients with comorbid conditions are generally not necessary when using otic formulations.  However, always consider the patient's overall clinical picture. Oral or IV ciprofloxacin requires dose adjustment based on renal function.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  
The dosage for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations is not applicable for this otic formulation. These scenarios would typically involve systemic administration of ciprofloxacin, which has different dosage guidelines.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**  
- Discomfort, itching, or pain in the ear
- Changes in taste perception


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**  
- Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
- Superinfection (overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms)


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to ciprofloxacin, boric acid, other quinolones, or any component of the medication
- Viral infections of the external ear canal, including herpes simplex
- Fungal or other parasitic ear infections



## **Drug Interactions**

Systemic drug interactions are unlikely due to minimal absorption of the otic formulation. However, theoretical interactions may occur with drugs that prolong the QT interval.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  While systemic absorption is low, there is limited data on the safety of these medications in these populations.  Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks to the fetus or infant.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Ciprofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA synthesis; boric acid provides antiseptic and drying action.
- **Side Effects:** Ear discomfort, pain, itching, changes in taste, rarely allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, viral/fungal/parasitic ear infections.
- **Drug Interactions:** Potential for QT prolongation with certain medications, although low risk due to minimal systemic absorption.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; weigh potential benefits and risks.
- **Dosage:**  See Standard Dosage section above.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Resolution of infection symptoms, signs of allergic reactions.

## **Popular Combinations**

Boric acid + ciprofloxacin is itself a combination product. Concurrent use of other otic preparations is generally not recommended.



## **Precautions**
- For otic use only. Do not use in the eyes.
- Discontinue use at the first sign of a hypersensitivity reaction.
