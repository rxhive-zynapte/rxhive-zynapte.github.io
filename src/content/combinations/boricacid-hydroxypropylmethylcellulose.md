## **Usage**

Boric acid + hydroxypropylmethylcellulose ophthalmic solution is primarily used as a lubricant and artificial tear for the relief of dry eyes and ocular irritation. It is also used during eye examinations and surgical procedures to maintain corneal moisture and protect the eye surface.  Boric acid, in combination with other ingredients like hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, acts as a buffer and helps maintain the pH of the solution. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose is a lubricant. Thus this drug combination is classified as an ophthalmic lubricant and demulcent.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Boric Acid + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose" is the generic name, this combination is often referred to as artificial tears.  Various brand names exist, and some include "ART Eye Drop."

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) is a viscosity-enhancing agent. It increases the thickness of the tear film, prolonging its contact time with the ocular surface and providing lubrication. Boric acid acts as a buffering agent, helping to maintain the physiological pH of the tear film. This combined effect alleviates dryness, irritation, and discomfort associated with dry eye conditions.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  HPMC is not systemically absorbed following topical ocular administration. Boric acid, when used in ophthalmic solutions at recommended concentrations, is minimally absorbed. The small amount that might be absorbed is excreted primarily by the kidneys.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Instill 1-2 drops into the affected eye(s) three to four times daily, or as needed.

#### **Children:** The dosage for children is generally the same as for adults, but should be administered under the supervision of a healthcare professional.  Specifically, for children above two years of age, use under the supervision of a medical professional. Its use is contraindicated in children below the age of two.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required, but monitoring for potential adverse effects is advisable.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment is usually unnecessary due to minimal systemic absorption.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustment is usually unnecessary due to minimal systemic absorption.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with glaucoma or other ocular conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The standard dosage generally applies to these clinical scenarios:

- **Intubation:** Use as needed for ocular lubrication.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Use during ophthalmic procedures to maintain moisture and protect the cornea.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Apply regularly to prevent corneal drying.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Frequent instillation is recommended.
- **Emergency Situations:** Use as needed to alleviate ocular irritation or dryness.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

While not routinely necessary, dosage adjustments may be considered in individual cases based on patient response and tolerance.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
- Transient blurred vision
- Mild stinging or burning upon instillation
- Sticky eyelashes

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
- Eye pain
- Vision changes
- Severe eye irritation or redness
- Allergic reactions (e.g., rash, itching, hives)

### **Long-Term Effects:** No significant long-term adverse effects have been reported with typical use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** Clinically significant ADRs are rare but may include severe allergic reactions.



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to boric acid or HPMC.
- Children under 2 years of age.


## **Drug Interactions**

No significant drug interactions have been reported with boric acid + hydroxypropylmethylcellulose ophthalmic solution. However, always inform your doctor about all other medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements, that you are using.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Data regarding the use of boric acid + HPMC ophthalmic solution during pregnancy and breastfeeding is limited. Consult with a healthcare professional to weigh the potential benefits and risks before use in these populations. As a precaution, use of this drug combination is not recommended in pregnancy and breastfeeding.
