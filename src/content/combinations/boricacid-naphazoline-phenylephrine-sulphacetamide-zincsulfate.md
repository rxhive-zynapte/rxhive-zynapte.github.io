## **Usage**

This ophthalmic solution is primarily prescribed for the treatment of superficial bacterial infections of the eye, most notably bacterial conjunctivitis (pink eye).  It addresses multiple facets of the infection due to its combined antibiotic, decongestant, and antiseptic properties.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Ophthalmic antibiotic, decongestant, antiseptic.

**Mechanism of Action:** Sulphacetamide, a sulfonamide antibiotic, disrupts bacterial folic acid synthesis, thereby inhibiting bacterial growth.  Boric acid and zinc sulfate exert antiseptic actions, further hindering bacterial proliferation. Naphazoline and phenylephrine, as alpha-adrenergic agonists, constrict conjunctival blood vessels, mitigating redness, swelling, and itching.

## **Alternate Names**

Zinkar Eye Drop (brand name).  Other brand names may exist depending upon the region and manufacturer.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** This combination product exerts a multifaceted effect on the eye. Sulphacetamide targets bacterial growth, while boric acid and zinc sulfate provide antiseptic activity.  Naphazoline and phenylephrine induce vasoconstriction, reducing inflammation and associated symptoms.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Absorption of the components into systemic circulation is minimal following topical ocular administration. The primary mechanism of action is local.  The components are likely eliminated through renal and/or hepatic pathways, but specific pharmacokinetic data for this combination is limited.


**Mode of Action:**

* **Sulphacetamide:** Inhibits dihydropteroate synthase, a key enzyme in the bacterial folic acid synthesis pathway.
* **Boric Acid/Zinc Sulfate:** Create an environment unfavorable for bacterial growth through antiseptic mechanisms.
* **Naphazoline/Phenylephrine:**  Activate alpha-adrenergic receptors on conjunctival blood vessels, leading to vasoconstriction.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation**: As described above, naphazoline and phenylephrine bind to alpha-adrenergic receptors. Sulphacetamide inhibits dihydropteroate synthase.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Instill 1–2 drops into the affected eye(s) every 2–4 hours. The frequency can be reduced as the infection subsides.

#### **Children:** Use in children requires strict physician supervision. Dosage and frequency will be determined by age, weight, and the severity of the infection.  Pediatric use necessitates careful monitoring for potential side effects.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary depending on individual patient health, particularly renal function.  A lower initial dose with close monitoring is advisable.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustment is indicated and should be correlated with the degree of renal impairment.  Close monitoring is crucial.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** While hepatic metabolism is not the primary route of elimination, caution is warranted in severe hepatic impairment. Monitor closely.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Administer with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes due to the potential exacerbating effects of the decongestant components.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Transient blurred vision
* Mild stinging or burning upon instillation

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Ocular pain
* Changes in vision
* Severe eye irritation or redness

### **Long-Term Effects:** Data specific to long-term use of this combination product is limited.

## **Contraindications**
