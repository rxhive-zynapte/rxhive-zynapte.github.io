## **Usage**

This ophthalmic solution is primarily prescribed for treating superficial bacterial eye infections, such as bacterial conjunctivitis (pink eye). It also alleviates associated symptoms like redness, swelling, itching, and burning.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Sulphacetamide: Sulfonamide antibiotic; Boric Acid and Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate: Antiseptics; Phenylephrine: Decongestant (alpha-adrenergic agonist).

- **Mechanism of Action:** Sulphacetamide inhibits bacterial growth by interfering with folic acid synthesis. Boric acid and zinc sulphate provide antiseptic action.  Zinc sulfate also acts as an astringent. Phenylephrine constricts blood vessels in the eye, reducing redness and swelling.

## **Alternate Names**

- Sulfin Eye Drop
- Phenosulf Eye Drop
- Zinkar Drop
- Sulphacetamide/Zinc Sulfate/Boric Acid combination
- Ophthalmic triple antibiotic combination

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Sulphacetamide exerts bacteriostatic action by competitively inhibiting dihydropteroate synthase, preventing bacterial folic acid synthesis and subsequent growth. Boric acid and zinc sulfate possess antiseptic and astringent properties, contributing to antibacterial activity. Phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, causes vasoconstriction, reducing eye redness and swelling.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** The combination is administered topically as eye drops. Absorption is minimal into systemic circulation. Primarily eliminated through lacrimal drainage and potentially some transconjunctival absorption.  Sulphacetamide, if absorbed systemically, is metabolized in the liver and excreted renally. Phenylephrine is metabolized by monoamine oxidase in the tissues and liver. Boric acid is excreted mainly unchanged in the urine. Zinc sulfate likely follows the same pathway if absorbed systemically.

- **Mode of Action (Cellular/Molecular):** Sulphacetamide competitively inhibits the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase within the bacterial cell.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily lacrimal drainage; if absorbed systemically, hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Instill 1–2 drops into the affected eye(s) every 2–4 hours. Reduce frequency as infection improves.

#### **Children:** Dosage should be determined by a pediatrician, based on the child's age and weight.  Safety and efficacy in infants under two months have not been established.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Monitor for systemic side effects, especially with prolonged use.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Monitor renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Monitor liver function.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate potential drug interactions, particularly for those with hypertension or cardiovascular disease due to the phenylephrine component.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosage for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations remains consistent with the standard adult recommendation. It is typically not indicated for these situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage modifications may be necessary depending on the patient's condition and response to therapy.
