## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to address deficiencies and support overall health, particularly bone and joint health.  It is often prescribed for conditions like osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. It may also be used to support the nervous system and cardiovascular health. This combination does not fall neatly into a single pharmacological classification, but rather encompasses multiple categories including vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids.

The mechanism of action involves multiple pathways due to the combined ingredients: calcium and vitamin D (calcitriol) for bone health, omega-3 fatty acids for anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular benefits, B vitamins (folic acid and methylcobalamin) for nerve function and cell growth, and boron, which may play a role in calcium metabolism.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no single official alternate name for this specific combination. It is often referred to as a multivitamin/mineral supplement with omega-3 fatty acids. Some brand names mentioned in the sources include TECHBONE MAX and Casbon DHA.

## **How It Works**

### **Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Calcitriol:** The active form of vitamin D, promotes calcium absorption in the gut and regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis, crucial for bone mineralization.
* **Calcium Carbonate:** Provides a source of calcium, essential for bone structure, muscle function, and nerve transmission.
* **Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA):** Omega-3 fatty acids with anti-inflammatory properties. They can reduce triglyceride levels and may have beneficial effects on cardiovascular health and brain function.
* **Folic Acid:** Essential for cell growth and division, especially during pregnancy. It plays a role in DNA synthesis and red blood cell formation.
* **Methylcobalamin:** A form of vitamin B12, crucial for nerve function, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell formation.
* **Boron:** May play a role in calcium metabolism, bone health, and brain function.

### **Pharmacokinetics:**

The individual components have different pharmacokinetic profiles:

* **Calcitriol:** Absorbed in the small intestine, metabolized in the liver and kidneys, and excreted in bile and urine.
* **Calcium Carbonate:** Absorption in the gut is influenced by vitamin D and other factors. Excreted primarily in urine and feces.
* **DHA/EPA:** Absorbed in the small intestine, incorporated into cell membranes, and metabolized like other fatty acids.
* **Folic Acid:** Absorbed in the small intestine, metabolized in the liver, and excreted in urine.
* **Methylcobalamin:** Absorbed in the ileum, bound to transcobalamin II in plasma, and stored in the liver. Excreted in bile and urine.
* **Boron:** Absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, distributed throughout the body, and excreted primarily in urine.


## **Dosage**

The dosage of this combination product can vary depending on the specific formulation and the patient's needs.  It's crucial to follow the doctor's prescription.


### **Standard Dosage**

Because this is not a pharmacologically standardized drug combination, there is no standard dosage. Dosing will depend on the brand chosen and the individual patient requirements for the specific nutrients in the product. 


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Due to the lack of standardization for this combination product, dosages for specific clinical situations aren't readily available.  The use of this product in settings like the ICU or during surgical procedures would likely depend on the patient's nutritional needs.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient factors like renal or hepatic impairment, age, and other health conditions. It is important to consult with a physician for appropriate dosing guidance.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Common side effects might include gastrointestinal upset (nausea, constipation, diarrhea), fishy aftertaste (from the omega-3s), and allergic reactions.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Hypercalcemia from excessive vitamin D and calcium intake is a potential serious side effect.

## **Contraindications**

Contraindications may vary depending on the specific components and their dosages. Patients with hypercalcemia, hypervitaminosis D, or known hypersensitivity to any of the components should avoid this combination.

## **Drug Interactions**

Potential drug interactions may occur between the individual ingredients and other medications. For instance, vitamin D can interact with certain medications like thiazide diuretics and some cholesterol-lowering drugs.  Omega-3 fatty acids can interact with anticoagulants.  It is vital to discuss all current medications and supplements with a physician before starting this product.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult a physician before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. While many of these ingredients are beneficial during these periods, appropriate dosages need to be determined on a case-by-case basis.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

See above sections.  No monitoring parameters exist for this particular non-standardized combination product.

## **Popular Combinations**

Since this is already a combination product, further combinations would need careful consideration based on individual patient needs and potential interactions.



## **Precautions**

General precautions include assessing patient history for potential allergies or sensitivities to the ingredients, evaluating renal and hepatic function as needed, and considering potential drug interactions. Specific precautions for pregnant and breastfeeding women, children, and the elderly should be taken.
