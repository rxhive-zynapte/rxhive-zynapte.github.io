## **Usage**

This combination of medications is primarily prescribed for nutritional deficiencies, particularly those related to bone health, calcium absorption, and vitamin B complex. It can be beneficial for conditions like osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and during pregnancy for optimal fetal development.  It doesn't fall neatly into a single pharmacological classification but rather encompasses vitamins, minerals, and vitamin analogs. Each component contributes to its overall therapeutic effect.

The mechanism of action is multifaceted, reflecting the diverse components. Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, regulates calcium and phosphorus absorption and bone mineralization. Calcium citrate provides a readily absorbable source of calcium, crucial for bone health and various physiological functions. L-methylfolate, the active form of folic acid, is essential for DNA synthesis and cell division. Methylcobalamin, the active form of Vitamin B12, is involved in nerve function and red blood cell formation. Magnesium oxide contributes to muscle and nerve function, while zinc sulfate supports immune function and cell growth. Boron plays a role in calcium and magnesium metabolism. 

## **Alternate Names**

There is no single official alternate name for this specific combination.  However, each component has its own chemical names or synonyms. This combination might be referred to by the brand name under which it's marketed.

Some example brand names include Aeocal Max, Provical-Max, and Mibcal. Other brand names may exist depending on the manufacturer and the specific formulation.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  This combination targets multiple physiological systems. Calcitriol enhances calcium absorption from the gut and regulates bone mineralization. Calcium is critical for bone structure, muscle contraction, nerve transmission, and blood clotting.  L-methylfolate is crucial for DNA synthesis, red blood cell formation, and neural tube development in the fetus. Methylcobalamin plays a role in nerve function, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell formation. Magnesium oxide supports muscle and nerve function, blood pressure regulation, and glucose control. Zinc sulfate is vital for immune function, cell growth, and wound healing. Boron's exact role is not fully understood but is thought to influence calcium and magnesium metabolism, potentially impacting bone health.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Calcitriol is absorbed from the gut and undergoes hepatic metabolism.  Calcium citrate is also absorbed in the gut, with absorption enhanced by calcitriol. L-methylfolate is readily absorbed. Methylcobalamin is absorbed through a receptor-mediated process in the ileum.  Magnesium oxide's absorption varies with the individual's magnesium status. Zinc sulfate is absorbed from the small intestine.  Boron is absorbed readily from the gastrointestinal tract.  Elimination pathways for the components vary, with renal excretion playing a significant role for some components.


## **Dosage**

Dosage recommendations are generalized, and patient-specific adjustments are crucial. Consult product-specific information or clinical guidelines for precise dosing.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  The dosage needs to be determined based on the patient's specific requirements and the formulation of the combination product.

#### **Children:**  Dosage in children should be determined by a pediatrician and is usually based on age and weight.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments might be necessary, especially with impaired renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Careful dose adjustments are needed based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Monitor closely and adjust dosage as needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Individualized dosing based on specific conditions is needed.

Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels) can occur with excessive doses of vitamin D and calcium, presenting with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, constipation, confusion, and muscle weakness.

### **Long-Term Effects**

No specific long-term effects have been established for this specific combination. Monitoring for hypercalcemia with prolonged high doses of calcium and vitamin D is necessary.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Significant ADRs are mainly related to hypercalcemia, requiring immediate medical attention.
