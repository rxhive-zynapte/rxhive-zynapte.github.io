## **Usage**

This combination of nutrients is primarily prescribed for the prevention and management of nutritional deficiencies, particularly those related to bone health, calcium and vitamin D metabolism, and red blood cell formation.  It is commonly used to address conditions like osteoporosis, osteomalacia, rickets, and hypoparathyroidism. It may also be prescribed as an adjunct therapy for secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients undergoing renal dialysis.  The combination supports bone health, enhances calcium absorption, and contributes to overall metabolic function.  Since this is a combination of nutrients rather than a single drug entity, it does not fall under a single pharmacological classification.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication does not have a universally recognized International Nonproprietary Name (INN). It is often referred to by the names of its constituent ingredients.  Several brand names exist depending on the manufacturer, including Travocal K2 and C-More K2.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  This combination exerts its effects through the synergistic action of its components:

* **Calcitriol:** The active form of vitamin D, calcitriol increases intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. It stimulates osteoclasts (bone-resorbing cells) and promotes calcium reabsorption in the kidneys.
* **Calcium Citrate Malate:** A highly bioavailable form of calcium, crucial for bone mineralization and various physiological processes.
* **Vitamin K2-7 (Menaquinone-7):** Activates osteocalcin, a protein that facilitates calcium incorporation into bone matrix, and Matrix Gla protein (MGP), which inhibits vascular calcification.
* **Folic Acid (Vitamin B9):** Essential for cell division and growth, crucial in red blood cell production and DNA synthesis.
* **Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B12):**  Plays a vital role in nerve function, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell formation.
* **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Exert anti-inflammatory effects and contribute to cardiovascular health.
* **Boron:** While its exact role in humans is still under investigation, boron is thought to influence calcium metabolism and bone health.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  The individual components have different pharmacokinetic properties:

* **Calcitriol:** Absorbed in the small intestine, metabolized in the liver and kidneys, and excreted mainly in bile.
* **Calcium Citrate Malate:** Absorbed in the small intestine, influenced by vitamin D levels and dietary factors.
* **Vitamin K2-7:** Absorbed in the small intestine and stored in various tissues, including the liver.
* **Folic Acid and Methylcobalamin:** Absorbed in the small intestine and stored in the liver.
* **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Absorbed in the small intestine and incorporated into cell membranes.
* **Boron:** Absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and excreted primarily in urine.



## **Dosage**

Dosage recommendations should be individualized based on the patient's specific needs and the clinical context.  Since this is a combination of multiple nutrients, dosage is not standardized and needs to be determined by a physician based on individual patient needs and the clinical context.

### **Standard Dosage**
No standardized dosage exists.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in clinical settings should be determined on a case-by-case basis by the attending physician.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are crucial for patients with renal impairment, hepatic dysfunction, and other comorbid conditions. These adjustments must be made under strict medical supervision.

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**
Gastrointestinal upset, nausea, constipation, headache, fatigue, dry mouth are possible.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, allergic reactions.

## **Contraindications**
