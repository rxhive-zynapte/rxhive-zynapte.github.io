## **Usage**

Brimonidine + Timolol is prescribed for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who are insufficiently responsive to topical beta-blockers.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Ophthalmic glaucoma agents â€“  combination of an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist (brimonidine) and a non-selective beta-adrenergic blocker (timolol).

**Mechanism of Action:** Brimonidine reduces aqueous humor production and increases uveoscleral outflow. Timolol decreases aqueous humor production. The combined effect results in a greater reduction of IOP than either agent alone.

## **Alternate Names**

Brimonidine tartrate/timolol maleate ophthalmic solution

**Brand Names:** Combigan, APO-Brimonidine-Timop, JAMP-Brimonidine-Timolol, and various generics.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Brimonidine acts as an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, stimulating alpha-2 receptors in the ciliary body, decreasing aqueous humor production, and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Timolol is a non-selective beta-blocker, reducing aqueous humor production by inhibiting beta-adrenergic receptors in the ciliary body.  The combined effect leads to a significant reduction in IOP.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:** Both brimonidine and timolol are absorbed systemically following topical ocular administration, though systemic exposure is low.
* **Metabolism:** Brimonidine is primarily metabolized in the liver. Timolol is partially metabolized in the liver.
* **Elimination:**  Brimonidine is primarily excreted in the urine. Timolol is excreted primarily unchanged in the urine.

**Mode of Action:**
* **Brimonidine:** Binds to alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the ciliary body, inhibiting adenylate cyclase activity and reducing aqueous humor production. Also increases uveoscleral outflow.
* **Timolol:** Blocks beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the ciliary body, decreasing aqueous humor production.

**Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for both drugs, with some hepatic metabolism.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  One drop in the affected eye(s) twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart.

#### **Children:** Not recommended for children under 2 years of age. Safety and efficacy in children 2-17 years have not been established. Use only if potential benefit outweighs the risk.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No dosage adjustment is generally necessary. Monitor for potential systemic effects of beta-blockade.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution.  Timolol has been associated with pronounced hypotension in patients with severe renal impairment on dialysis.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with diabetes (may mask hypoglycemia), cardiovascular disease (monitor for bradycardia, hypotension, and worsening heart failure),  reactive airway disease,  and myasthenia gravis.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Brimonidine + Timolol is not typically used in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary indication is chronic glaucoma and ocular hypertension management.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be needed for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, cardiovascular disease, or respiratory disease.  Close monitoring is recommended.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Ocular:  Burning or stinging, foreign body sensation, ocular hyperemia, pruritus, blurred vision, dry eye, tearing, eyelid erythema or edema.

Systemic:  Headache, dry mouth, drowsiness, fatigue, allergic reactions (rare).


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Ocular: Iritis, uveitis, corneal erosion.

Systemic: Bradycardia, hypotension, syncope, heart failure exacerbation, bronchospasm, depression.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term use may result in dry eye or worsening of pre-existing cardiovascular or respiratory conditions.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, significant bradycardia or hypotension, bronchospasm.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to brimonidine, timolol, or any component of the formulation.
* Reactive airway disease including asthma or severe COPD.
* Sinus bradycardia, second- or third-degree atrioventricular block, overt cardiac failure, or cardiogenic shock.
* Patients receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor therapy.
* Neonates and infants (under 2 years of age).

## **Drug Interactions**

* **CYP450 Interactions:** Minimal interaction.
* **Other Drug Interactions:**
    * Beta-blockers (additive effects).
    * Calcium channel blockers (increased risk of bradycardia and hypotension).
    * CNS depressants (additive CNS depression).
    * Tricyclic antidepressants and mianserin (diminished therapeutic effect of brimonidine).
    * MAO inhibitors (increased risk of systemic side effects of brimonidine).

* **Food and lifestyle factors:** Alcohol may enhance the hypotensive effects of timolol.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (Australia); Not Assigned (US FDA). Not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. Potential for fetal harm.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Not recommended. Timolol is excreted in breast milk. Potential for neonatal side effects.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Decreases aqueous humor production and increases uveoscleral outflow (brimonidine); Decreases aqueous humor production (timolol).
* **Side Effects:** Ocular irritation, dry mouth, drowsiness, bradycardia, hypotension.
* **Contraindications:** Asthma/COPD, severe heart conditions, MAO inhibitor use, infants.
* **Drug Interactions:** Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, CNS depressants, TCAs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Not recommended.
* **Dosage:** One drop twice daily.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** IOP, heart rate, blood pressure.


## **Popular Combinations**

Not applicable. Brimonidine + Timolol is itself a fixed-dose combination.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Monitor for ocular and systemic side effects. Assess cardiovascular and respiratory status before initiating therapy.
* **Specific Populations:**  Use with caution in pregnant/breastfeeding women, children, elderly patients, and those with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or respiratory disease.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Alcohol may potentiate hypotensive effects.  May cause drowsiness and blurred vision; caution with driving or operating machinery.
