## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for reducing pain and inflammation associated with various conditions, including:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Ankylosing spondylitis
* Trauma and post-surgical swelling
* Soft tissue injuries

**Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing proteolytic enzymes (bromelain, trypsin, chymotrypsin), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) (diclofenac), and a bioflavonoid (rutoside).  It can be classified as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and proteolytic enzyme combination.

**Mechanism of Action:** Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and thus inflammation and pain. Bromelain, trypsin, and chymotrypsin are proteolytic enzymes that break down proteins, including inflammatory mediators like bradykinin and fibrin, further contributing to anti-inflammatory and anti-edema effects. Rutoside, a bioflavonoid, acts as an antioxidant and may enhance the anti-inflammatory effects of other components by stabilizing capillary walls and reducing capillary permeability.


## **Alternate Names**

While there isn't a universally recognized alternate name for this specific combination, each component has its own synonyms. This combination is often referred to simply as a proteolytic enzyme and diclofenac combination.

**Brand Names:** This combination is available under various brand names in India, including Rutoheal, Flamar 3D, Rutimox-D and others.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Diclofenac provides analgesic and anti-inflammatory action through COX inhibition. Proteolytic enzymes contribute to anti-inflammatory and anti-edema effects by breaking down proteins involved in inflammation. Rutoside strengthens capillary walls.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Diclofenac is well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver by CYP enzymes, and excreted primarily through the kidneys.  Bromelain is also absorbed orally, though its bioavailability is variable. Trypsin and chymotrypsin are administered as enteric-coated formulations to protect them from gastric acid. Rutoside is generally well-absorbed.  Elimination pathways for the enzymes are not fully characterized.

**Mode of Action:** Diclofenac inhibits COX-1 and COX-2, blocking prostaglandin production. Proteolytic enzymes cleave peptide bonds in proteins associated with the inflammatory cascade. Rutoside strengthens capillary walls and reduces their permeability. Receptor binding or neurotransmitter modulation are not the primary modes of action for this combination.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** A common dosage is one tablet containing Diclofenac 50mg, Bromelain 90mg, Trypsin 48mg, and Rutoside 100mg, twice daily. The dosage may vary depending on the specific product formulation.

#### **Children:** The safety and efficacy of this combination have not been established in children under 12 years of age.


#### **Special Cases:**
* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be required based on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce the dose according to creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Careful monitoring and dose adjustment are necessary. 
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate underlying conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or peptic ulcer disease before prescribing.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of this combination in specialized settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not specifically recommended in medical literature.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on renal and hepatic function, age, and other medical conditions. Consult medical references for detailed guidance.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, indigestion, diarrhea, dizziness, blurred vision.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:** Gastrointestinal bleeding, allergic reactions, renal dysfunction, hepatotoxicity.


### **Long-Term Effects:** With prolonged diclofenac use, consider monitoring for cardiovascular and renal complications.
