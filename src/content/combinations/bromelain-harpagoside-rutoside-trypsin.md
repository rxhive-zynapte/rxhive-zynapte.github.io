## **Usage**

This combination is prescribed to relieve pain and inflammation associated with various musculoskeletal conditions, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. It may also be used for general pain relief, including pain associated with fever, headache, menstrual cramps, and toothache.  Additionally, some studies suggest its use in managing temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis and as an adjuvant therapy for sepsis in children.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Analgesic, anti-inflammatory, proteolytic enzyme combination.

- **Mechanism of Action:**  This combination works synergistically to reduce pain and inflammation. Bromelain and trypsin are proteolytic enzymes that break down proteins involved in the inflammatory process. Rutoside is a flavonoid and antioxidant that prevents cell damage and reduces swelling. Harpagoside inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory mediators.


## **Alternate Names**

Bromelain-Trypsin-Rutoside combination; Proteolytic enzyme combination with Rutoside. Some brand names include Dolanzen, Rutoheal, and Phlogenzym.  Specific formulations may also include diclofenac or papain.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Bromelain and trypsin break down inflammatory proteins, reducing swelling and pain. Rutoside acts as an antioxidant, preventing further damage from free radicals, and also possesses anti-inflammatory properties. Harpagoside further inhibits pro-inflammatory mediators.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Specific combined pharmacokinetic data are limited. Bromelain is absorbed orally and excreted renally. Trypsin is mainly metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract. Rutoside is metabolized in the liver.

- **Mode of Action:** Bromelain and trypsin exert proteolytic activity, breaking down proteins involved in inflammation. Rutoside acts as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. Harpagoside inhibits pro-inflammatory mediators.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal (bromelain) and hepatic (rutoside) pathways.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  One tablet two to three times daily, taken orally with or without food. Taking it with food might help reduce gastrointestinal side effects.

#### **Children:** Generally not recommended for children under 18 years old due to insufficient safety and efficacy data. Limited studies exist exploring its use as adjunctive therapy for sepsis in children aged 1 month to 12 years.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary depending on individual patient needs and organ function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; dose adjustments might be needed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution; dose adjustments might be needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution advised for patients with a history of stomach ulcers, bleeding disorders, heart problems, hypertension, diabetes, asthma, bowel problems, or liver and kidney issues.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage for specific clinical situations (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations) needs to be determined by the treating physician based on individual patient factors. No specific dosage guidelines are available for these cases.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications might be required based on renal or hepatic impairment, concurrent medications, and individual response to therapy.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, indigestion, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, gas, dry mouth.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Allergic reactions (skin rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), gastrointestinal bleeding.


### **Long-Term Effects:**
Chronic use could potentially lead to gastrointestinal problems in certain individuals.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) and gastrointestinal bleeding.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any components (bromelain, trypsin, rutoside, harpagoside); severe bleeding disorders (e.g., hemophilia); active peptic ulcer disease; pregnancy.


## **Drug Interactions**

Anticoagulants, antiplatelet medications, antibiotics (tetracyclines, sulfonamides, amoxicillin), antihypertensives (benazepril, captopril, enalapril, fosinopril, lisinopril), antidepressants, certain cancer medications (fluorouracil, vincristine), warfarin. Interactions may also occur with certain foods and supplements like ginger, garlic, and others. Alcohol should be avoided as its interaction is unknown.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of miscarriage associated with bromelain. Avoid during breastfeeding as it's unknown if components are excreted in breast milk.


## **Drug Profile Summary**


- **Mechanism of Action:** Combined analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects via proteolytic enzyme activity and antioxidant/anti-inflammatory properties.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, indigestion, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, bleeding disorders, peptic ulcer, pregnancy.
- **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, antibiotics, antihypertensives.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
- **Dosage:** As directed by the physician; typically one tablet two to three times daily.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Signs of bleeding, gastrointestinal discomfort, allergic reactions.


## **Popular Combinations**

Often prescribed alone; sometimes combined with diclofenac for temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis.


## **Precautions**

Screen for allergies (especially to pineapple, papain), assess renal and hepatic function, especially in elderly patients. Monitor for gastrointestinal bleeding, use cautiously in patients with a history of peptic ulcers.
