## **Usage**

This combination of enzymes and a bioflavonoid is primarily prescribed for reducing inflammation and swelling associated with various conditions, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, post-operative inflammation (e.g., after minor surgery or dental procedures), trauma injuries, edema, and for pain relief (toothache, headache, muscle ache, backache, menstrual cramps).

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Proteolytic enzymes, anti-inflammatory, anti-edemic, antioxidant.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Bromelain, trypsin, and papain are proteolytic enzymes that break down proteins, which in turn reduces inflammation and promotes tissue healing. Rutoside, a flavonoid, acts as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, strengthens blood vessels, and improves circulation. Trypsin, papain, and bromelain increase blood supply to the affected area to promote healing. Rutoside helps by preventing further swelling and inflammation by neutralizing free radicals that cause cell damage.


## **Alternate Names**

Bromelain-Trypsin-Rutoside combination; Proteolytic enzyme combination with Rutoside; Bromelain-Papain-Rutoside-Trypsin combination.
Some brand names include:  Phlogam, Rutoheal, and Enzictra.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Bromelain, trypsin, and papain exert their effects by breaking down proteins involved in the inflammatory cascade.  Rutoside stabilizes capillary walls, reducing vascular permeability and edema.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Bromelain is absorbed intact through the gastrointestinal tract (approximately 40%). Trypsin and papain are partially absorbed, likely through peptide transport mechanisms. Rutoside's absorption is limited (around 17%), occurring primarily in the colon after deglycosylation by gut bacteria.
    - **Metabolism:**  Bromelain is rapidly deactivated in the blood. Trypsin metabolism is not well documented. Rutoside is metabolized to quercetin.
    - **Elimination:**  Some trypsin may be excreted in urine. Elimination pathways for bromelain, papain, and rutoside metabolites are not fully elucidated.

- **Mode of Action:** Bromelain, trypsin, and papain directly break down inflammatory mediators. Rutoside inhibits the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes.

- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Limited information is available regarding specific receptor interactions or neurotransmitter modulation. The primary mechanism involves enzymatic breakdown of proteins involved in inflammation and oxidative stress.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 1-2 tablets two or three times daily. Some sources specify a dosage strength of 48 mg trypsin, 90 mg bromelain, and 100 mg rutoside.

#### **Children:** One tablet per 10 kg body weight daily, divided into 2-4 partial doses. Use with caution in children under 12 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution; dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution; dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with bleeding disorders, hypertension, or those taking anticoagulants, antibiotics, or antihypertensives.


### **Clinical Use Cases:**

Clinical trials have investigated the use of Bromelain + Trypsin + Rutoside in specific settings such as Temporomandibular Joint Osteoarthritis.  Specific dosage recommendations for other clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) use, and emergency situations are not well-established and require further research.


### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments may be needed for elderly patients, and those with renal or hepatic impairment.  Consult a doctor before consuming alcohol with this medication.


## **Side Effects**

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term effects are not well-established.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
