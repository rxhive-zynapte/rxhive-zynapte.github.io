## **Usage**

This combination of enzymes and a bioflavonoid is primarily prescribed for reducing inflammation and swelling associated with various conditions, including traumatic injuries, surgical procedures, and osteoarthritis.  It aids in wound healing, tissue repair, and pain reduction in inflammatory conditions. It can also support digestive health by reducing gastrointestinal inflammation.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Anti-inflammatory, proteolytic, antioxidant.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Bromelain and papain are proteolytic enzymes that break down proteins, reducing inflammation and promoting healing. Trypsin and chymotrypsin also have proteolytic and anti-inflammatory properties, further enhancing these effects. Rutoside, a bioflavonoid, acts as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, neutralizing free radicals and reducing inflammation. The combination works synergistically to address inflammation and promote tissue repair.


## **Alternate Names**

While there isn't a universally recognized alternate name for this specific combination, individual components are sometimes referred to by other names:

- **Rutoside:** Rutin
- Other names may exist based on specific manufacturers' formulations.

- **Brand Names:**  This combination is marketed under various brand names like Rutoheal and others depending on the region and manufacturer.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Bromelain, papain, trypsin, and chymotrypsin exert their effects by breaking down proteins involved in inflammation, thereby reducing swelling and pain.  Rutoside stabilizes cell membranes and reduces capillary permeability, thus minimizing fluid leakage into tissues and further reducing swelling. Rutoside also has antioxidant properties.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**  These enzymes are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but their exact absorption rates and bioavailability are not fully established. They are metabolized in the liver and eliminated through renal and hepatic pathways. Rutoside is also absorbed orally and extensively metabolized.

- **Mode of Action:** The proteolytic enzymes act directly on inflammatory mediators. Rutoside inhibits inflammatory pathways and scavenges free radicals.

- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** The specific receptors or enzymes targeted by this combination are not fully elucidated, although the proteolytic activity is central to their function.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal and hepatic.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
A common dosage is one tablet containing 90 mg bromelain, 100 mg rutoside, 48 mg trypsin, and varying amounts of papain and chymotrypsin, taken two to three times daily. The dosage can be adjusted based on the specific condition and patient response.

#### **Children:**  
Dosage in children should be determined by a physician based on weight and age, considering potential safety concerns.

#### **Special Cases:**  
Dosage adjustments may be necessary for elderly patients, and those with renal or hepatic impairment.  Patients with comorbid conditions require careful evaluation.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  
Dosage in specific clinical situations should be determined by a physician based on individual patient needs. There are no established standard dosages for specific procedures like intubation, surgery, or use in the ICU.

### **Dosage Adjustments**  
Dose adjustments may be necessary based on renal or hepatic function, other metabolic disorders, and other factors.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Nausea, diarrhea, stomach upset.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**  
Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), increased risk of bleeding.

### **Long-Term Effects:**
Potential long-term effects are not well-documented, but prolonged use may increase the risk of gastrointestinal issues or bleeding in susceptible individuals.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  
Severe allergic reactions, significant gastrointestinal bleeding.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication.
- Conditions with increased bleeding risk.
- Concurrent use of anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications.
- Severe hepatic or renal impairment.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents (increased bleeding risk).
- Certain antibiotics.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not well-established.  It is generally advised to avoid use unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Proteolytic and anti-inflammatory action, antioxidant properties.
