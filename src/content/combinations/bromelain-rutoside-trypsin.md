## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for reducing pain and inflammation associated with various conditions, including:

*   Osteoarthritis
*   Rheumatoid arthritis
*   Ankylosing spondylitis
*   Soft tissue injuries (sprains, strains)
*   Post-surgical inflammation and pain
*   Sports injuries

Its pharmacological classification includes:

*   Analgesic
*   Anti-inflammatory
*   Proteolytic enzyme

**Mechanism of Action:**

This combination works through the synergistic action of its components:

*   **Bromelain:** A proteolytic enzyme derived from pineapple, breaks down proteins involved in inflammation, reducing swelling and pain. It also aids in the absorption of other medications and nutrients.
*   **Trypsin:** Another proteolytic enzyme that breaks down proteins, further reducing inflammation and promoting tissue healing by clearing dead tissue and inflammatory mediators.
*   **Rutoside (Rutin):** A flavonoid with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, strengthens blood vessels, improves circulation, and protects against free radical damage, which further contributes to reducing inflammation.

## **Alternate Names**

While the generic name is Bromelain + Rutoside + Trypsin, it is marketed under several brand names, including Phlogenzym. There might be other international or regional variations in the names.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

The combination reduces pain, swelling, and inflammation in musculoskeletal and other conditions by promoting blood supply to the affected area.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:**  Administered orally.  Absorption is enhanced when taken after meals.
*   **Metabolism:** Hepatic metabolism plays a role in processing these components.
*   **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion, but further details about specific metabolic pathways or CYP enzyme involvement are limited based on current resources.

**Mode of Action:** Bromelain and trypsin act as proteolytic enzymes, breaking down proteins associated with inflammation. Rutoside acts as an antioxidant, scavenging free radicals and reducing inflammation. Currently, no detailed information on receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation is available.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

A typical dosage is two tablets containing 48 mg trypsin, 90 mg bromelain, and 100 mg rutoside, taken three times a day. It's generally recommended to take the medication after meals to minimize gastrointestinal discomfort.

#### **Children:**

Not generally recommended for children under 12 years old. Specific pediatric dosing guidelines require further investigation.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual health conditions and organ function.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Careful dose adjustments are needed considering renal clearance rate.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Adjustments are required due to potential impaired metabolism.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised for patients with bleeding disorders, liver or kidney disease, or those taking anticoagulants or other interacting medications.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

While the combination is used in various clinical settings related to pain and inflammation management, explicit dosage recommendations for specific procedures like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU care are not readily available in the provided sources.  Dosages are usually tailored to individual patient needs and the severity of the condition.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be necessary for patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, bleeding disorders, or those on interacting medications. Consult with a specialist for specific adjustments based on individual patient factors.

*   Antidepressants

Consult a doctor before combining with any other medications, including OTC drugs and supplements. Interactions with alcohol and specific foods (e.g., ginger, garlic) are also possible.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

This combination is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of miscarriage. Its safety during breastfeeding is not well-established, so it is generally avoided.
