## **Usage**

This combination is prescribed for respiratory tract infections where both thinning mucus and antibacterial action are beneficial, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and upper respiratory tract infections with excessive mucus production.  It is also used in cases of abdominal surgery with risk of bronchopulmonary complications.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**
    - Bromhexine: Mucolytic, expectorant
    - Cefalexin: First-generation cephalosporin antibiotic

- **Mechanism of Action:**
    - Bromhexine breaks down mucopolysaccharides in the mucus, reducing its viscosity and making it easier to cough up.  It also activates the ciliated epithelium, further aiding mucus clearance.
    - Cefalexin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death.


## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names for the combination exist.  It is commonly referred to as Bromhexine + Cefalexin or Cefalexin + Bromhexine.

- **Brand Names:**  Resporidex, Stancare (These are regional and might not be available everywhere.)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**
    - Bromhexine increases the volume of respiratory secretions and reduces their viscosity, thus facilitating expectoration.
    - Cefalexin exerts bactericidal activity against susceptible bacteria, primarily gram-positive organisms.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Bromhexine is rapidly absorbed orally and metabolized in the liver. It is highly protein-bound and excreted primarily in the urine.
    - Cefalexin is well-absorbed orally, minimally metabolized, and excreted mainly by the kidneys.

- **Mode of Action:**
    - Bromhexine: Depolymerizes mucopolysaccharide fibers in mucus.
    - Cefalexin: Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins.

- **Elimination Pathways:**
    - Bromhexine: Primarily renal excretion.
    - Cefalexin: Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Cefalexin 500mg â€“ 2g with Bromhexine 8mg-16mg three times a day.

#### **Children:**

Cephalexin 25-100 mg/kg/day (divided into multiple doses) with Bromhexine according to age:  (<2 years: 1mg TID; 2-6 years: 2mg TID; 6-12 years: 4mg TID).



#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Start with lower doses of both drugs and monitor renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Reduce the dose of cefalexin based on creatinine clearance. Bromhexine should be used with caution.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use Bromhexine with caution.  Cefalexin dose adjustment is usually not required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Adjust doses based on the specific comorbid condition and potential drug interactions. 


### **Clinical Use Cases**  Dosage recommendations may vary; consultation with a pulmonologist or infectious disease specialist is essential. The information below is meant as general guidance.

- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation,  ICU Use, Emergency Situations:** Dose adjustments are often necessary based on patient status and may involve intravenous administration of antibiotics.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjust doses based on renal/hepatic function, patient response, and other medications the patient may be taking.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Bromhexine: Nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal upset, dizziness, headache.
- Cefalexin: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, rash, allergic reactions.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Bromhexine:  Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis).
- Cefalexin: Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), *Clostridium difficile* infection.


### **Long-Term Effects:**  Not typically associated with short-term use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** As listed above, plus any signs of a severe allergic reaction.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to either bromhexine or cefalexin.
- History of severe penicillin allergy (for cefalexin).
- Active peptic ulcer disease (for bromhexine).


## **Drug Interactions**

- Bromhexine may increase the concentration of certain antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin) in bronchial secretions.
- Cefalexin may interact with probenecid, metformin, and warfarin.
- Both drugs can interact with other medications metabolized by the liver or excreted by the kidneys.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Bromhexine: Use only if clearly needed and under medical supervision.
- Cefalexin: Generally considered safe but should be used cautiously and under medical advice.


## **Drug Profile Summary**  (This is a basic summary. Individual patient responses will vary.)

- **Mechanism of Action:** Bromhexine (mucolytic), Cefalexin (inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis)
- **Side Effects:** GI upset, rash, allergic reactions (rarely severe).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, penicillin allergy (cefalexin), peptic ulcer (bromhexine).
- **Drug Interactions:**  See Drug Interactions section.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
- **Dosage:** See Dosage section.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Respiratory status, renal function (especially in special populations).


## **Popular Combinations**  This refers to other drugs that may be added to the Bromhexine + Cefalexin regimen, not Bromhexine + Cefalexin itself which is already a combination.

Other antibiotics or respiratory medications may be added depending on the specific infection and patient needs.


## **Precautions**

Evaluate renal and hepatic function, allergies, and other medications. Monitor for adverse reactions. Exercise caution in patients with asthma or a history of peptic ulcer disease.
