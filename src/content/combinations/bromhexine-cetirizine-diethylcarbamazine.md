## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for filarial infections (like lymphatic filariasis) and tropical pulmonary eosinophilia. It targets the parasitic infection and manages associated allergic symptoms.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antiparasitic, antihistamine, mucolytic.

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination works through the synergistic action of its three components:

*   **Diethylcarbamazine (DEC):**  Immobilizes and kills microfilariae (larval stage of filarial worms) by affecting their neuromuscular function, increasing their vulnerability to the host's immune system.
*   **Cetirizine:** An antihistamine that blocks histamine H1 receptors, reducing allergic reactions (itching, swelling, inflammation) linked to filarial infections.
*   **Bromhexine:** A mucolytic that thins and loosens mucus in the airways, easing its expulsion and managing respiratory symptoms related to the infection or allergic response.

## **Alternate Names**

No specific alternate names exist for this combination. It is typically referred to by its constituent generic names. Brand names may vary regionally.  A popular brand name in India is Bcd.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

*   **DEC:** Affects the neuromuscular function of microfilariae, leading to paralysis and death.
*   **Cetirizine:** Antagonizes the effects of histamine at H1 receptors, reducing allergic symptoms.
*   **Bromhexine:** Alters the structure of mucus, reducing its viscosity and making it easier to clear.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** DEC and cetirizine are well-absorbed orally. Bromhexine is also absorbed orally and metabolized to its active metabolite, ambroxol.
*   **Metabolism:** DEC is extensively metabolized in the liver. Cetirizine undergoes less extensive metabolism. Bromhexine is metabolized in the liver to ambroxol.
*   **Elimination:** DEC and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Cetirizine is also mainly excreted unchanged in the urine. Bromhexine and ambroxol are eliminated through renal excretion.

**Mode of Action:**

*   **DEC:** Disrupts neuromuscular transmission in microfilariae.
*   **Cetirizine:** Competitively inhibits histamine binding to H1 receptors.
*   **Bromhexine:** Depolymerizes mucopolysaccharides, reducing mucus viscosity.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One tablet containing 8 mg bromhexine, 10 mg cetirizine, and 50 mg diethylcarbamazine. Dosage frequency and treatment duration are determined by the physician based on the specific infection.

#### **Children:**

Pediatric dosing is determined by a physician, considering the child's age and weight.  Cetirizine is generally considered safe for children older than 6 months, but DEC is typically not recommended for young children.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment may be necessary. Start with a lower dose and monitor for adverse effects.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is required.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment may be required.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration of potential drug interactions is essential; adjust treatment as needed.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage adjustments for specific clinical settings (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, emergency situations) should be determined on a case-by-case basis by the treating physician, considering patient-specific factors and the underlying condition.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on individual patient characteristics, including renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, fatigue, loss of appetite, dry mouth, dizziness, sleepiness, headache, allergic reactions.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, liver dysfunction, seizures.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic complications from prolonged use are rare, but monitoring for liver and kidney function is advisable.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe skin reactions, angioedema, anaphylaxis, hepatotoxicity.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any component; severe renal or hepatic impairment; pregnancy (DEC); breastfeeding (DEC and cetirizine).

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy:** DEC and cetirizine are contraindicated during pregnancy.
