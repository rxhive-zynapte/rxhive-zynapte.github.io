## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the relief of cough, nasal congestion, and other symptoms associated with the common cold, allergies, or other respiratory tract infections.  It is not available as a single formulation; instead, similar combinations with phenylephrine are available. The provided combination contains a mucolytic, antihistamine, cough suppressant, expectorant, and decongestant.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This combination includes drugs from the following classifications:

* **Mucolytic:** Bromhexine
* **Antihistamine:** Chlorpheniramine Maleate
* **Cough Suppressant:** Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide
* **Expectorant:** Guaifenesin
* **Decongestant:** Pseudoephedrine (Note: Sources mention Phenylephrine, a similar decongestant, instead of Pseudoephedrine)

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination works by thinning and loosening mucus (Bromhexine, Guaifenesin), suppressing the cough reflex (Dextromethorphan), reducing allergic responses (Chlorpheniramine), and relieving nasal congestion by constricting blood vessels in the nasal passages (Pseudoephedrine/Phenylephrine).

## **Alternate Names**

There is no one official international nonproprietary name (INN) for this combination product as it is not commonly available with pseudoephedrine.  The individual components have the following INNs: Bromhexine Hydrochloride, Chlorpheniramine Maleate, Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide, Guaifenesin, and Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride/Sulfate. Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region. One brand name mentioned in the sources containing a similar combination (with Phenylephrine) is Bodrexin Flu & Batuk (Indonesia).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Bromhexine:** Reduces mucus viscosity by breaking disulfide bonds in mucoproteins.
* **Chlorpheniramine:** Antagonizes histamine H1 receptors, reducing allergic symptoms.
* **Dextromethorphan:**  Suppresses the cough reflex by acting centrally on the medulla oblongata.
* **Guaifenesin:** Increases respiratory tract fluid secretions, making it easier to cough up phlegm.
* **Pseudoephedrine:**  Alpha-adrenergic agonist causing vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa, relieving congestion.

**Pharmacokinetics:** All components are absorbed orally.  Metabolism is primarily hepatic via CYP450 enzymes, especially for Dextromethorphan and Chlorpheniramine. Elimination is primarily renal.  Pseudoephedrine is partially metabolized and partially excreted unchanged in the urine.


## **Dosage**

As this specific combination is not generally available commercially, dosage information is not provided in standard resources. Dosage information for similar combinations containing phenylephrine is available, as outlined below.  Always consult local guidelines and product-specific information.

**Standard Dosage for a combination containing Phenylephrine:**

**Adults:** 10 mL orally every 6 hours, not exceeding 4 doses daily (for a syrup containing 2 mg chlorpheniramine, 15 mg dextromethorphan, 100 mg guaifenesin, and 10 mg phenylephrine per 5 mL).

**Children:**
* 6-12 years: 5 mL every 6 hours, not exceeding 4 doses daily.
* 2-6 years: 2.5 mL every 6 hours, not exceeding 4 doses daily.

**Special Cases:**  Dosage adjustments should be made based on patient factors like renal or hepatic impairment. Insufficient data exists in the sources to provide specific recommendations for these special cases.

**Clinical Use Cases:** There are no specific dosage recommendations for this combination in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, or ICU use.  Individual components may be used separately in such settings.

## **Side Effects**

**Common Side Effects:**  Drowsiness, dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, constipation, blurred vision.

**Rare but Serious Side Effects:** Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), difficulty breathing, hallucinations, confusion.
