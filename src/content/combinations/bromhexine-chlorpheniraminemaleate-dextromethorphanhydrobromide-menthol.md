## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of cough associated with the common cold, allergies, or other respiratory tract infections.  It is indicated for productive coughs where thinning and loosening of mucus is beneficial.  It combines several drug classes for a multi-pronged approach:

- **Mucolytic (Bromhexine):**  Breaks down mucus, making it less viscous and easier to expectorate.
- **Antihistamine (Chlorpheniramine Maleate):**  Reduces allergic symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy throat.
- **Cough Suppressant (Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide):** Suppresses the cough reflex by acting on the cough center in the brain.
- **Topical Anesthetic/Cooling Agent (Menthol):** Soothes throat irritation.

## **Alternate Names**

While there isn't a universally recognized alternate name for this specific four-drug combination, each individual ingredient has various names.  It is essential to carefully check the composition when encountering similar formulations.  Some brand names may exist in different regions, but a comprehensive international list is currently unavailable. It is important to note that as of June 3, 2023, this specific combination, along with several others containing similar ingredients, has been banned in India due to lack of therapeutic justification and potential risks.

## **How It Works**

### **Pharmacodynamics:**

- **Bromhexine:** Depolymerizes mucopolysaccharides, reducing mucus viscosity.
- **Chlorpheniramine:**  A first-generation antihistamine that competitively antagonizes H1 receptors.
- **Dextromethorphan:**  NMDA receptor antagonist and sigma-1 receptor agonist, suppressing the cough reflex.
- **Menthol:** TRPM8 receptor agonist producing a cooling sensation and mild local anesthetic effect.


### **Pharmacokinetics:**

- **Bromhexine:** Well-absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in urine.
- **Chlorpheniramine:**  Readily absorbed from the GI tract.  Metabolized in the liver, with some renal excretion.
- **Dextromethorphan:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6. Excreted in urine.
- **Menthol:**  Absorbed through skin and mucous membranes. Metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and bile.
