## **Usage**

This combination medication is used for symptomatic relief of productive cough (cough with mucus) associated with the common cold, allergies, and other respiratory tract infections.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* **Bromhexine:** Mucolytic
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Antihistamine (first-generation)
* **Guaifenesin:** Expectorant

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination works by thinning and loosening mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up.  Bromhexine breaks down the chemical structure of mucus, reducing its viscosity. Chlorpheniramine reduces allergic symptoms like runny nose and sneezing by blocking histamine. Guaifenesin increases the volume of fluids in the airways, further aiding in mucus removal.


## **Alternate Names**

Bromhexine-Chlorpheniramine-Guaifenesin; Bromhexine Hydrochloride + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Guaifenesin.

**Brand Names:** Cheston Expectorant, Kuff Q, and others.



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Bromhexine reduces mucus viscosity, Chlorpheniramine counteracts histamine's effects, and Guaifenesin increases airway fluid volume to facilitate expectoration.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** All three drugs are absorbed orally.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily hepatic metabolism via CYP450 enzymes.
* **Elimination:** Mainly renal excretion, though some metabolites may be eliminated through bile.


**Mode of Action:**

* **Bromhexine:** Depolymerizes mucopolysaccharides in mucus, reducing its viscosity.
* **Chlorpheniramine:**  Competitively antagonizes histamine at H1 receptors, mitigating allergic manifestations.
* **Guaifenesin:**  Believed to stimulate receptors in the gastric mucosa, increasing respiratory tract fluid secretions.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**

* **Chlorpheniramine:** H1 receptor antagonist.


**Elimination pathways:** Predominantly renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 

8 mg Bromhexine, 4 mg Chlorpheniramine Maleate, and 100-200 mg Guaifenesin, orally, three to four times daily. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 32 mg Bromhexine, 24 mg Chlorpheniramine Maleate, and 2400 mg Guaifenesin.

#### **Children:** 

Dosage must be determined by a physician based on the child's weight or age. Use with caution in children younger than 6 years old.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose reduction may be needed due to decreased hepatic and renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Careful dose adjustment is necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction may be required.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specialized clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations should be determined on a case-by-case basis by a physician.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be necessary for renal/hepatic impairment, metabolic disorders, or potential drug interactions.
