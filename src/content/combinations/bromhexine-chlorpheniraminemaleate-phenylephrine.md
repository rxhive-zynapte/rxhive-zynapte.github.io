## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for symptomatic relief of common cold, flu, and allergies affecting the upper respiratory tract.  It addresses symptoms like cough with mucus, nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, itchy and watery eyes, and sinus pressure.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination drug containing a mucolytic (bromhexine), an antihistamine (chlorpheniramine maleate), and a decongestant (phenylephrine).

- **Mechanism of Action:** Bromhexine breaks down thick mucus, making it easier to expel. Chlorpheniramine maleate blocks histamine, reducing allergic symptoms. Phenylephrine constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving congestion.


## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for this specific combination. However, each individual component has various synonyms (e.g., bromhexine hydrochloride), and the combination itself might be marketed under different brand names depending on the region and manufacturer.
- **Brand Names:** While specific brand names are numerous and vary by region, they typically combine elements suggesting cold and cough relief.  Consult local pharmaceutical resources for prevalent brand names in India.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Bromhexine decreases mucus viscosity. Chlorpheniramine maleate opposes histamine's effects, reducing vascular permeability, edema, and itching. Phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, causes vasoconstriction, reducing nasal congestion.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Bromhexine:**  Well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, and excreted primarily in the urine.
    - **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** Readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, metabolized in the liver, primarily excreted in the urine.
    - **Phenylephrine:** Less well-absorbed orally than other components. Metabolized by monoamine oxidase in the intestine and liver, eliminated in the urine.

- **Mode of Action:**
    - Bromhexine: Depolymerizes mucopolysaccharide fibers in mucus, reducing viscosity.
    - Chlorpheniramine Maleate: Competes with histamine for H1-receptor sites, antagonizing its actions.
    - Phenylephrine: Stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors in vascular smooth muscle, causing vasoconstriction.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly renal excretion for all three components.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  A common dosage is one tablet or 10ml syrup every 6-8 hours. However, always follow the specific formulation guidelines. Do not exceed the maximum daily dose as indicated on the product packaging or prescribed by the physician.
