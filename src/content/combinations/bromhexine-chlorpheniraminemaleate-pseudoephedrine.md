## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of common cold and flu symptoms, including cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.  It is also used to alleviate symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis and sinusitis.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing a mucolytic (bromhexine), an antihistamine (chlorpheniramine maleate), and a decongestant (pseudoephedrine).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Bromhexine reduces mucus viscosity, facilitating expectoration. Chlorpheniramine maleate antagonizes histamine H1 receptors, reducing allergic symptoms. Pseudoephedrine acts as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, causing vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa, which relieves congestion.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no officially recognized alternate names for this specific combination. However, it may be referred to colloquially by names reflecting its components, such as "bromhexine-chlorpheniramine-pseudoephedrine." Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region.



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Bromhexine breaks down mucopolysaccharides, reducing mucus viscosity. Chlorpheniramine maleate competitively inhibits histamine at H1 receptor sites, leading to a decrease in allergic manifestations. Pseudoephedrine stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors, producing vasoconstriction which shrinks swollen nasal membranes.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Bromhexine:**  Well-absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver, primarily to ambroxol, which is also pharmacologically active. Excreted renally.
    - **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:**  Readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Metabolized in the liver.  Eliminated renally.
    - **Pseudoephedrine:**  Well-absorbed orally. Partially metabolized in the liver. Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.
- **Mode of Action:**
    - **Bromhexine:** Depolymerizes mucopolysaccharides, decreasing mucus viscosity.
    - **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:**  Blocks H1 receptors, inhibiting histamine-mediated responses such as vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and smooth muscle contraction.
    - **Pseudoephedrine:** Stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle, resulting in vasoconstriction.
- **Elimination Pathways:** All three components are primarily eliminated via renal excretion, with some hepatic metabolism involved for bromhexine and chlorpheniramine.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  The standard dose is typically one tablet or 10ml of syrup every 4-6 hours, not to exceed a maximum of 4 doses within a 24 hour period. Each tablet/10ml dose usually contains 8mg of bromhexine, 2mg of chlorpheniramine maleate, and 30mg of pseudoephedrine.

#### **Children:** Dosage in children varies by age and should be determined by a physician. It is not generally recommended for children under 6 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary due to age-related decline in renal and hepatic function. Lower starting doses are often recommended.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose reduction is advised, based on the degree of impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution should be exercised and dose adjustments may be required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, or glaucoma. This combination should be used with caution in these patients, and individualized dosing may be necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of this combination is not typically indicated in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its primary role is in the symptomatic relief of relatively mild respiratory conditions.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on patient factors such as age, renal function, hepatic function, and coexisting medical conditions.  Always consider the patient's individual needs and clinical presentation.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, headache, restlessness, insomnia, palpitations, increased heart rate, hypertension, urinary retention, blurred vision.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), breathing difficulties, hallucinations, seizures, irregular heartbeat.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic use of pseudoephedrine can lead to tolerance and rebound congestion.  Long-term use of antihistamines can potentially result in cognitive impairment.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any severe or unusual reaction should be reported immediately, especially if indicative of an allergic reaction or cardiovascular event.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication.
- Severe hypertension
- Severe coronary artery disease
- History of stroke or risk factors for stroke
- Severe renal impairment
- Concurrent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or within 14 days of stopping MAOIs
- Glaucoma
- Prostatic hypertrophy
- Respiratory depression

## **Drug Interactions**

- MAOIs: Concurrent use may lead to hypertensive crisis.
- Antihypertensive medications: Pseudoephedrine may reduce their effectiveness.
- Tricyclic antidepressants:  May enhance anticholinergic effects.
- Beta-blockers:  May lead to paradoxical hypertension.
- Alcohol:  May increase the risk of adverse effects, particularly drowsiness and dizziness.
- Other medications with similar ingredients: Avoid concurrent use to prevent overdosage.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use should be avoided during pregnancy, especially the first trimester.  Limited information suggests potential risks to the fetus.  The medication may pass into breast milk and could affect the nursing infant.  Non-sedating antihistamines are generally preferred during breastfeeding if necessary. Consult with a physician before use.
