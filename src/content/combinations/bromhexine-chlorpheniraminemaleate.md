## **Usage**

Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate is prescribed for the relief of coughs associated with mucus (productive cough) in conditions like common cold, allergies, and certain respiratory infections such as bronchitis.  It may also be used to manage symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, itchy and watery eyes, and itchy nose or throat.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**
    - Bromhexine: Mucolytic, Expectorant
    - Chlorpheniramine Maleate: Antihistamine (first generation, sedating)

- **Mechanism of Action:** Bromhexine breaks down mucus, making it less viscous and easier to expel. Chlorpheniramine maleate blocks the action of histamine, reducing allergy symptoms.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate" is the standard generic name, variations may exist internationally. This combination is often found as part of multi-ingredient cold and cough medications.

- **Brand Names:** This combination is marketed under various brand names, some of which include Askafex-BR and Inacin Cold depending on the region and specific formulation.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Bromhexine reduces mucus viscosity by breaking down mucopolysaccharide fibers. Chlorpheniramine maleate antagonizes the H1 histamine receptor, reducing capillary permeability and smooth muscle contraction, thereby mitigating allergic manifestations.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Bromhexine: Readily absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver, primarily via hepatic CYP enzymes, and excreted renally.
    - Chlorpheniramine Maleate: Well-absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver and eliminated through renal excretion.

- **Mode of Action:**  Bromhexine alters the structure and reduces the viscosity of mucus. Chlorpheniramine maleate competitively inhibits the binding of histamine to its H1 receptors.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Both drugs are primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted through the kidneys.


## **Dosage**

The dosage information provided below pertains to the Bromhexine and Chlorpheniramine combination and may differ depending on the specific formulation. Please refer to the individual product information and consult patient history for accurate prescription.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Bromhexine: 8 mg three times a day. This may be increased up to 16 mg three times a day, especially during the initial days of treatment.
Chlorpheniramine: 4 mg every 4-6 hours, not exceeding 24 mg/day. Extended-release preparations allow for less frequent dosing.

#### **Children:**

Dosing in children is dependent on age and weight and should be carefully determined by a doctor. Children younger than 6 years old should not be given over-the-counter cough and cold medications containing multiple ingredients including Chlorpheniramine.  A general guideline is provided below, however always refer to specific product information:
Chlorpheniramine:
- 2-6 years: 1 mg every 4-6 hours, not exceeding 6 mg/day
- 6-12 years: 2 mg every 4-6 hours, not exceeding 12 mg/day
- 12+ years: adult dose

Bromhexine:
- 2-5 years: 2 mg three times a day or 4 mg twice daily (max 8mg daily)
- 6-11 years: 4-8 mg three times daily (max 24mg daily)
- 12+ years: adult dose

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Reduced doses are often necessary due to age-related decline in organ function.  Start with lower doses and monitor closely.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustments are essential due to reduced clearance; consult a nephrologist for appropriate dose adjustments.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Reduced doses are recommended.  Close monitoring is crucial.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised for patients with hypertension, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, glaucoma, prostatic enlargement, gastric ulcer, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and COPD. Individualized assessment and dose modifications may be necessary.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The Bromhexine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate combination is generally not indicated for use in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It's primarily used for outpatient management of cough and cold symptoms. Other medications are typically preferred in these specialized medical contexts.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments should be based on individual patient factors, including renal or hepatic function, comorbid conditions, concomitant medications, and age. Therapeutic drug monitoring might be helpful in some cases. Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism could influence dosing.
