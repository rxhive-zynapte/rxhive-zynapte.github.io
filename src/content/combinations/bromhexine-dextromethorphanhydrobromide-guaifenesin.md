## **Usage**

- This combination drug is prescribed for the relief of coughs associated with the common cold, influenza, and other respiratory tract infections.  It helps loosen and thin mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up. Dextromethorphan suppresses the cough reflex, while guaifenesin loosens and thins mucus. Bromhexine also breaks down thick mucus.

- **Pharmacological classification:**  Expectorant (Guaifenesin), Mucolytic (Bromhexine), and Antitussive (Dextromethorphan).

- **Mechanism of action:** Bromhexine works by breaking down mucopolysaccharides, reducing the viscosity of mucus. Dextromethorphan acts on the cough center in the brain to suppress the urge to cough. Guaifenesin increases respiratory tract fluid volumes, making it easier to cough up mucus.


## **Alternate Names**

- No commonly used alternate generic names.
- Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region. Some examples include Bisolvon Chesty, Solvin Cold, and Tussin.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Bromhexine reduces mucus viscosity, Dextromethorphan suppresses cough, and Guaifenesin thins and loosens phlegm.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** All three components are absorbed orally.
    - **Metabolism:** Dextromethorphan is metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Bromhexine is also metabolized in the liver. Guaifenesin's metabolism is not fully understood.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion for all three components.

- **Mode of action:** Bromhexine acts on mucus at a molecular level by depolymerizing mucopolysaccharides. Dextromethorphan acts centrally on the cough center in the medulla oblongata.  Guaifenesin's precise mode of action is unknown but it is thought to increase respiratory tract secretions by irritating the gastric mucosa.

- **Receptor binding/Enzyme inhibition:** Dextromethorphan is a non-selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and sigma-1 receptor agonist. Bromhexine may stimulate lysosomal enzymes. No known receptor interactions for guaifenesin.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Bromhexine: 8-16 mg three times daily
- Dextromethorphan: 10-20 mg every 4 hours or 30 mg every 6-8 hours, not exceeding 120mg/day
- Guaifenesin: 200-400 mg every 4 hours, not exceeding 2.4g/day
- Dosage may be adjusted based upon the specific product containing this drug combination.  As always, prescribing information should be confirmed for the specific drug.

#### **Children:**

- Consult prescribing information before administering to children.  The combination is generally not recommended for children under 4 years of age. Dosing adjustments for children are often made using specialized combination solutions formulated for this age group.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment may be necessary due to age-related decline in renal and hepatic function. 
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution should be exercised and dose reduction may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction may be necessary for dextromethorphan and bromhexine due to hepatic metabolism. 
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- The Bromhexine, Dextromethorphan, and Guaifenesin combination is typically not used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU.  Its use is primarily for symptomatic relief of cough in outpatient settings. 

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient factors, including renal or hepatic impairment, or other underlying medical conditions.  Always consult prescribing information.
