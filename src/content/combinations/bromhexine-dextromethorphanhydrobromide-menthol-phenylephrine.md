## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of cough associated with the common cold, bronchitis, and other respiratory tract infections.  It helps to loosen and thin mucus (Bromhexine), suppress cough (Dextromethorphan), decongest nasal passages (Phenylephrine), and soothe throat irritation (Menthol).
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing a mucolytic (Bromhexine), cough suppressant (Dextromethorphan), decongestant (Phenylephrine), and a counterirritant (Menthol).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Bromhexine breaks down mucopolysaccharides, reducing mucus viscosity. Dextromethorphan suppresses the cough reflex by acting on the cough center in the brain. Phenylephrine constricts blood vessels in the nasal mucosa, reducing congestion. Menthol stimulates cold receptors, providing a cooling sensation and relieving throat irritation.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific four-ingredient combination.  However, it may be referred to by different brand names depending on the manufacturer and region.
- **Brand Names:** Several brand names exist, including Coughdip-P,  Oxidyne P,  Bromo D, and others.  Brand names can vary by region.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Bromhexine decreases mucus viscosity, facilitating expectoration. Dextromethorphan suppresses the cough reflex centrally. Phenylephrine constricts nasal blood vessels, reducing congestion. Menthol provides a cooling sensation and relieves throat irritation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  The components are absorbed orally. Dextromethorphan is metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP2D6. Phenylephrine is metabolized by monoamine oxidase. Bromhexine is metabolized in the liver.  Menthol is metabolized in the liver.  Specific pharmacokinetic data for the combination product may vary. Elimination pathways are primarily renal and hepatic.
- **Mode of Action:** Bromhexine depolymerizes mucopolysaccharides in mucus. Dextromethorphan acts on sigma opioid receptors and NMDA glutamate receptors.  Phenylephrine activates alpha-adrenergic receptors. Menthol activates TRPM8 receptors.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Dextromethorphan acts on sigma opioid receptors and NMDA receptors. Phenylephrine activates alpha-adrenergic receptors.  Bromhexine has no known specific receptor binding.
