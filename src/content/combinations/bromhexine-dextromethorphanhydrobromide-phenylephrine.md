## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of cough associated with the common cold, flu, or other upper respiratory tract infections. It helps to loosen and thin mucus (Bromhexine), suppress cough (Dextromethorphan), and reduce nasal congestion (Phenylephrine).
- **Pharmacological Classifications:**
    - Bromhexine: Mucolytic, Expectorant
    - Dextromethorphan: Antitussive
    - Phenylephrine: Decongestant (Sympathomimetic Amine)
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Bromhexine breaks down the structure of mucus, making it less viscous and easier to expectorate. Dextromethorphan acts centrally on the cough center in the medulla to suppress the cough reflex. Phenylephrine acts as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, constricting blood vessels in the nasal mucosa, which reduces swelling and congestion.


## **Alternate Names**

- While there isn't a universally recognized alternate name for this specific combination, the individual components may be referred to by various chemical names or synonyms.
- **Brand Names:** The medication is marketed under various brand names depending on the manufacturer and country. Some examples from the sources include Leekuf Junior Syrup and Oxidyne P.  Many more brand names exist.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Bromhexine increases the production of serous mucus in the respiratory tract, which helps to thin the more viscous, purulent secretions, thus facilitating expectoration. Dextromethorphan suppresses the cough reflex by its action on the cough center in the brain. Phenylephrine, through its vasoconstricting effects, reduces nasal congestion.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** All three drugs are absorbed orally.  Phenylephrine absorption is sometimes erratic.
    - **Metabolism:**  Bromhexine is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily via hepatic oxidation and demethylation. Dextromethorphan undergoes hepatic metabolism, with its major metabolite, dextrorphan, also exhibiting antitussive activity. Phenylephrine is primarily metabolized by monoamine oxidase in the gastrointestinal tract and liver.
    - **Elimination:** Bromhexine metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Dextromethorphan and its metabolites are also predominantly excreted renally. Phenylephrine and its metabolites are eliminated primarily via the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:**  Bromhexine depolymerizes mucopolysaccharide fibers in mucus, reducing its viscosity.  Dextromethorphan binds to sigma opioid receptors in the central nervous system, which contributes to its cough suppressant effect. Phenylephrine acts as an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist, causing vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa.  


## **Dosage**

Dosage information for this combination product varies by brand and formulation.  It is crucial to refer to the specific product's packaging and prescribing information.  Here is some compiled information from various sources, that may be found in some formulations, however it should not be followed without verifying against the specific product's information.
