## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the relief of cough associated with the common cold, allergies, and other respiratory tract infections. It helps to loosen and thin mucus, making it easier to cough up.  It also helps reduce allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing a mucolytic (bromhexine), an antihistamine (diphenhydramine), and an expectorant (guaifenesin).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Bromhexine breaks down the mucus, making it less viscous. Guaifenesin thins the mucus and makes it easier to cough out. Diphenhydramine blocks the action of histamine, reducing allergy symptoms.


## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific three-drug combination internationally, although regional variations may occur.
- Brand names for products containing these three ingredients vary depending on the country and manufacturer. Several brands market cough and cold medications containing these ingredients.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Bromhexine acts as a mucolytic, decreasing the viscosity of mucus. Guaifenesin increases the volume and reduces the viscosity of secretions in the respiratory tract. Diphenhydramine acts as an antihistamine, blocking H1 receptors and reducing the effects of histamine, which causes allergy symptoms.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** All three drugs are absorbed well from the gastrointestinal tract.
    - **Metabolism:**  Bromhexine is extensively metabolized in the liver. Diphenhydramine is also metabolized in the liver. Guaifenesin is metabolized to a lesser extent.
    - **Elimination:** Bromhexine metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Diphenhydramine is excreted in the urine, mainly as metabolites. Guaifenesin is excreted in the urine, both unchanged and as metabolites.
- **Mode of Action:** Bromhexine breaks down disulfide bonds in mucoproteins, reducing mucus viscosity. Guaifenesin increases respiratory tract fluid, making it easier to expectorate.  Diphenhydramine competitively antagonizes H1 receptors, reducing allergy symptoms.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  10 mL (or two teaspoonfuls) of syrup, three times a day. Do not exceed six teaspoonfuls within a 24 hour period. Dosage may also vary depending on the formulation and strength of individual products.

For children aged 6 to 12, 5 mL (or one teaspoonful) of syrup, three times a day is generally recommended, but dosage should be adjusted according to the child's weight and the physician's advice.
