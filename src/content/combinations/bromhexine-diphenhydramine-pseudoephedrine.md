## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of cough, nasal congestion, and other respiratory symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, allergies, and other respiratory tract infections like bronchitis and sinusitis.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This drug is a combination of three different classes of medications:

*   **Mucolytic:** Bromhexine
*   **Antihistamine:** Diphenhydramine
*   **Decongestant:** Pseudoephedrine

## **Alternate Names**

There is no internationally recognized non-proprietary name for this specific combination. Alternate names are generally brand names specific to the region where the drug is marketed. Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and country.

## **How It Works**

**Bromhexine:**

*   **Pharmacodynamics:** Reduces the viscosity of mucus by breaking down mucopolysaccharides, making it easier to expectorate.
*   **Pharmacokinetics:** Well-absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine.

**Diphenhydramine:**

*   **Pharmacodynamics:** An antihistamine that blocks the effects of histamine, reducing allergic symptoms like runny nose and sneezing. Also possesses antitussive (cough-suppressing) and sedative properties. It acts primarily as an inverse agonist of the H1 receptor.
*   **Pharmacokinetics:** Well-absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine.

**Pseudoephedrine:**

*   **Pharmacodynamics:** A sympathomimetic amine that acts as a decongestant by constricting blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion. Acts on alpha-adrenergic receptors.
*   **Pharmacokinetics:** Readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Partially metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine.
