## **Usage**

- This combination medication is prescribed for productive cough (cough with mucus) associated with bronchospasm (tightening of airways) in conditions like bronchitis, bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, and emphysema.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination drug containing a mucolytic (Bromhexine), expectorant (Guaifenesin), bronchodilator (Terbutaline), and a topical anesthetic/cooling agent (Menthol).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Bromhexine breaks down mucus, Guaifenesin thins and loosens mucus, Terbutaline relaxes and widens airways, and Menthol provides a cooling and soothing effect on irritated airways.

## **Alternate Names**

- While the generic name is Bromhexine + Guaifenesin + Menthol + Terbutaline, several brand names exist internationally and regionally.
- **Brand Names:**  BroncorexÂ® is a well-known example. Several other brand names are available depending upon the region and country.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Bromhexine increases the production of serous mucus in the respiratory tract, reducing the viscosity of sputum. Guaifenesin increases fluid volume in the airways, lubricating the irritated respiratory tract and promoting efficient coughing. Terbutaline stimulates beta-2 receptors in the lungs, causing bronchodilation. Menthol stimulates cold receptors, producing a cooling sensation and relieving minor throat irritation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  All components are absorbed orally.  Terbutaline is metabolized in the liver, while Bromhexine is partially metabolized. Elimination is primarily renal. Guaifenesin is excreted unchanged.
- **Mode of Action:** Bromhexine acts by depolarizing the cell membranes of serous cells which leads to an increase in mucus secretions. Guaifenesin increases the output of respiratory tract fluid by irritating the gastric mucosa and stimulating vagal afferent pathways. Terbutaline relaxes bronchial smooth muscle by acting as a selective beta2 adrenergic agonist. Menthol activates TRPM8 ion channels which results in a cooling sensation.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Terbutaline is a beta-2 adrenergic agonist. Other components are not known to specifically bind to receptors or directly influence enzyme activity or neurotransmitters.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Bromhexine and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Guaifenesin is also eliminated in urine mostly unchanged. Terbutaline and menthol are metabolized in the liver, with subsequent elimination through the kidneys.

## **Dosage**
