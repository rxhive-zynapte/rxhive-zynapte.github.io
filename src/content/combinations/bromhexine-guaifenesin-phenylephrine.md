## **Usage**

- This combination medication is prescribed for the relief of symptoms associated with the common cold, allergies, and other respiratory tract infections, particularly those characterized by a cough with mucus (productive cough) and nasal congestion.  It is indicated for conditions like bronchitis, laryngitis, sinusitis, pneumonia, and URTI (Upper Respiratory Tract Infection), as well as in cases of asthma and COPD to manage mucus.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination drug containing a mucolytic (Bromhexine), an expectorant (Guaifenesin), and a decongestant (Phenylephrine).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Bromhexine breaks down the thick mucus, making it less viscous and easier to expectorate. Guaifenesin helps increase the volume of respiratory secretions and thins the mucus further, promoting its expulsion. Phenylephrine constricts the blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving nasal congestion.


## **Alternate Names**
- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination. However, variations may exist regionally.
- **Brand Names:** This drug is marketed under various brand names like Flemnil and BIMED.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Bromhexine acts on the disulfide bonds of mucoproteins in the mucus, reducing its viscosity. Guaifenesin increases respiratory tract fluid volumes, hydrating the airways and facilitating mucus clearance. Phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, acts on alpha-1 receptors in the vascular smooth muscle of the nasal mucosa, causing vasoconstriction and thereby reducing nasal congestion.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**  
    - **Bromhexine:** Absorbed well orally. Metabolized in the liver. Excreted mainly in the urine.
    - **Guaifenesin:**  Rapidly absorbed from the GI tract. Metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine.
    - **Phenylephrine:** Poorly absorbed orally.  Undergoes first-pass metabolism in the gut and liver.  Excreted in urine.

- **Mode of Action:** Bromhexine acts by directly depolymerizing mucopolysaccharides in the mucus. Guaifenesin is believed to stimulate receptors in the gastric mucosa, triggering reflex stimulation of bronchial glands, increasing respiratory secretions. Phenylephrine binds to alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, leading to vasoconstriction.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- The typical adult dose is 10 ml of syrup or one tablet, administered every 4-6 hours, not exceeding six doses per day. Dose is also available as a dissolving granule or powder. The strength is 8 mg Bromhexine, 100 mg Guaifenesin, and 60 mg pseudoephedrine per 10 ml.
