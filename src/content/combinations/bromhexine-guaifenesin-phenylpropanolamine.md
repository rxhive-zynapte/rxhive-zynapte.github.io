## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the relief of cough with mucus, chest congestion, and common cold symptoms.  It is classified as an expectorant, mucolytic, and decongestant.  The combination works by thinning and loosening mucus (bromhexine and guaifenesin), suppressing cough (dextromethorphan, if present in some formulations), and reducing nasal congestion (phenylpropanolamine).

## **Alternate Names**

Bromhexine-Guaifenesin-Phenylpropanolamine.  Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region. Examples found include Kabu Tablet, Sudin Kid Syrup, and Tussnil Tablet.  It is important to note that this exact combination isn't a standard fixed-dose combination in all regions.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Bromhexine:** This mucolytic agent breaks down mucopolysaccharides, reducing the viscosity of mucus.  This makes it easier to expectorate.
* **Guaifenesin:** An expectorant that increases the volume and reduces the viscosity of respiratory secretions, facilitating their removal by coughing.
* **Phenylpropanolamine:** An alpha-adrenergic agonist that constricts blood vessels in the nasal mucosa, reducing swelling and congestion.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  All three components are absorbed orally.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily hepatic metabolism, although the specific pathways for this combination aren't detailed in the provided sources.
* **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion.  Specific details on CYP enzyme involvement aren't available in the provided sources.

**Mode of Action:**

* **Bromhexine:** Depolymerizes mucopolysaccharides.
* **Guaifenesin:**  Stimulates receptors in the gastric mucosa, indirectly increasing respiratory tract fluid.
* **Phenylpropanolamine:**  Acts on alpha-adrenergic receptors in the nasal mucosa.
