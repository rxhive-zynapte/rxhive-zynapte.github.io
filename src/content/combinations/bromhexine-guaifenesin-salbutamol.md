## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of productive cough associated with various respiratory disorders, including:

* Acute bronchitis (including tracheobronchitis)
* Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB)
* Bronchial asthma
* Emphysema
* Asthmatic bronchitis
* Pneumonia
* Other bronchopulmonary disorders where bronchospasm, mucus plugging, and difficulty with expectoration coexist.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This is a combination product containing drugs from three different pharmacological classifications:

* **Salbutamol:** Bronchodilator (Beta-2 adrenergic agonist)
* **Bromhexine:** Mucolytic
* **Guaifenesin:** Expectorant

**Mechanism of Action:**

* **Salbutamol:** Relaxes the smooth muscles of the airways by stimulating beta-2 adrenergic receptors, leading to bronchodilation and improved airflow.
* **Bromhexine:** Breaks down the disulfide bonds in mucoproteins, reducing the viscosity of sputum and making it easier to expectorate.
* **Guaifenesin:** Increases respiratory tract fluid secretions, which helps to thin and loosen mucus, facilitating its removal by coughing.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination does not have a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN). It's often referred to by the names of its individual components.

**Brand Names:** Ascorex Expectorant, Salbux Plus Syrup, Pecof/Pecof SF, Shaltoux Expectorant, Eascof Expectorant, Caryl Cough Syrup, Vento Broncho M.  Numerous other brand names may exist regionally.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The combined effect of bronchodilation, mucus thinning, and expectoration improves airflow and reduces cough.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Salbutamol:**  Well-absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in urine.
* **Bromhexine:**  Readily absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine. Dose proportional pharmacokinetics.
* **Guaifenesin:** Readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Rapidly metabolized and excreted in the urine.

**Mode of Action:**

* **Salbutamol:** Binds to beta-2 adrenergic receptors, activating adenylate cyclase and increasing intracellular cAMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation in the airways.
* **Bromhexine:** Depolymerizes mucopolysaccharide fibers in mucus.
* **Guaifenesin:** Stimulates receptors in the gastric mucosa, which reflexively increases respiratory tract secretions.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for all three components.  Salbutamol and Bromhexine undergo hepatic metabolism before renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 10-20 ml thrice daily.
