      How does Bromhexine work to relieve cough?**


      **A:** Bromhexine acts as a mucolytic, breaking down the thick mucus in
      the airways, making it easier to cough up. It also stimulates ciliary
      activity which aids mucus clearance.

## **Usage**

Bromhexine + Phenylpropanolamine is prescribed for the relief of symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, and other respiratory tract infections. Specifically, it targets cough and nasal congestion.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This combination drug falls into multiple categories:

* **Bromhexine:** Mucolytic, Expectorant
* **Phenylpropanolamine:** Decongestant, α-adrenergic agonist


**Mechanism of Action:**

* **Bromhexine:**  Thins and loosens mucus (phlegm) in the airways, making it easier to cough up. It also increases ciliary activity, further aiding mucus clearance.
* **Phenylpropanolamine:** Constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.

## **Alternate Names**

No internationally recognized alternate names were found within the provided sources.  However, regional variations may exist. Several brand names containing this combination exist, although sources focus more on Bromhexine + Dextromethorphan + Phenylpropanolamine formulations. A few of the available brand names for Bromhexine + Phenylpropanolamine include Alvex P syrup and Borac syrup (the exact compositions may vary slightly).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Bromhexine:** Depolymerizes mucopolysaccharides, reducing mucus viscosity.  Stimulates serous glands to increase watery secretions, further thinning the mucus.
* **Phenylpropanolamine:** Acts as an α-adrenergic agonist, causing vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Bromhexine:** Readily absorbed orally.  Metabolized in the liver. Eliminated primarily via the kidneys.
* **Phenylpropanolamine:** Well-absorbed orally.  Metabolized in the liver.  Excreted mainly through the kidneys.

**Mode of Action (Cellular/Molecular):**

* **Bromhexine:** Acts on mucus glands, breaking down the complex structure of mucus. Increases ciliary beat frequency, promoting mucus clearance.
* **Phenylpropanolamine:** Stimulates α-adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle, leading to vasoconstriction.

**Elimination Pathways:**

* **Bromhexine:** Primarily renal excretion.
* **Phenylpropanolamine:** Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Phenylpropanolamine: 25 mg orally every 4 hours, or 75 mg extended-release every 12 hours. The maximum daily dose is 150 mg.
Bromhexine: 8 mg three times daily.  Some sources mention 16 mg three times daily for the first 7 days for some conditions.

#### **Children:**

Dosages vary based on age and formulation. 

* **Bromhexine:**
  * &lt;2 years: 1 mg three times daily
  * 2-6 years: 2 mg three times daily.
  * 6-12 years old: 4mg (in 5mL syrup) three times daily.
* **Phenylpropanolamine:**
    * 2 to 6 years: 6.25 mg orally every 4 hours (maximum daily dose is 37.5 mg)
    * 6 to 12 years: 12.5 mg orally every 4 hours (maximum daily dose is 75 mg)
    * >12 years: 25mg every 4 hours.

Pediatric safety should be carefully considered, especially in younger children. Precise dosing and appropriate formulation are crucial.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and monitor closely due to potential age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised, and dosage adjustments may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment. Reduced doses are often required. Close monitoring for signs of toxicity is essential.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Exercise caution; dosage adjustment may be required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, thyroid disorders, glaucoma, or prostatic hypertrophy. Close monitoring is essential.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specialized clinical settings (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations) should be determined on a case-by-case basis by consulting a specialist and considering patient-specific factors and the severity of the condition. Standard or adjusted dosages based on patient condition are typically utilized.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, elderly patients, and those with specific comorbid conditions. Individualized dosing strategies are required based on the patient's clinical status.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, drowsiness, insomnia, restlessness, stomach upset.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, difficulty breathing, swelling of face, tongue or throat), hallucinations, seizures, irregular heartbeat, tachycardia, increased blood pressure (hypertensive crisis).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic use of phenylpropanolamine can potentially lead to hypertension and other cardiovascular complications.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Serious ADRs like Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis have been rarely reported.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any component, severe liver/kidney disease,  monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) use within the past 14 days, severe heart disease, uncontrolled hypertension, hyperthyroidism, closed-angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, pregnancy (especially the first trimester), breastfeeding.


## **Drug Interactions**

MAOIs, antidepressants, antihypertensives, digoxin, sympathomimetics, caffeine, alcohol. The provided sources also mention interactions with antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anticancer agents, quinidine, ranolazine, ritonavir, sibutramine, terbinafine, guanethidine, methyldopa, furazolidone, and theophylline.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
