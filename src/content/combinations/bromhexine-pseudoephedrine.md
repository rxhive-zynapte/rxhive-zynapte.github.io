## **Usage**

Bromhexine + Pseudoephedrine is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of cough and nasal congestion associated with the common cold, flu, and other respiratory tract infections such as acute bronchitis and sinusitis.  It combines a mucolytic (Bromhexine) and a decongestant (Pseudoephedrine).

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Mucolytic expectorant and decongestant.


**Mechanism of Action:**

Bromhexine reduces the viscosity of mucus by breaking down mucopolysaccharides and mucoproteins, thereby facilitating expectoration. Pseudoephedrine acts as a sympathomimetic amine with predominantly alpha-adrenergic activity causing vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa which shrinks swollen nasal membranes and opens up the airways.

## **Alternate Names**

While there isn't a universally recognized alternate name for this fixed-dose combination itself, the components have other names:

* **Bromhexine:** Bisolvon is a common alternate name, along with Bromhexin Hydrochloride.
* **Pseudoephedrine:** Sudafed, Drixoral are amongst the most commonly used brand names.

**Brand Names:**

Brand names may vary in different regions but may include combinations of the individual drug names or unique brand names specific to the formulation. Some examples include Ascoril D, Solvin Cold, and Bro-Zedex. Please note this is not an exhaustive list and new brand names may emerge.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Bromhexine:**  Increases serous bronchial secretions, reducing mucus viscosity and improving mucociliary clearance.
* **Pseudoephedrine:** Stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors in the respiratory tract, leading to vasoconstriction, reduced nasal congestion, and widening of the airways.


**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Bromhexine:** Well absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver with metabolites further conjugated and excreted primarily in urine. 
* **Pseudoephedrine:**  Readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Partially metabolized in the liver, and the remainder is excreted unchanged in the urine. Its elimination can be prolonged in individuals with renal impairment.


**Mode of Action:**

* **Bromhexine:** Depolymerizes mucopolysaccharide fibers in mucus, making it less viscous.
* **Pseudoephedrine:**  Acts as a sympathomimetic amine activating alpha-adrenergic receptors.


**Elimination Pathways:**

* **Bromhexine:** Primarily renal excretion.
* **Pseudoephedrine:** Renal excretion (primarily unchanged drug).


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Standard adult dosage is typically 8 mg bromhexine and 60 mg pseudoephedrine administered every 4-6 hours, not to exceed 4 doses in 24 hours.  This may be in tablet or syrup form.


#### **Children:**

For children older than 12 years the adult dose is typically prescribed. It is generally not recommended for children under 12 years of age unless under specific guidance and monitoring by a physician. If prescribed for children 6-12 years old, lower doses may be used, as directed by the physician.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose due to potential age-related decrease in organ function.  Careful monitoring is advised.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution, especially in severe impairment where pseudoephedrine may accumulate. Dosage adjustment is often required, and the drug may even be contraindicated in severe cases.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution. Dose adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with hypertension, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, and prostatic hypertrophy.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Bromhexine + Pseudoephedrine is primarily indicated for symptomatic relief of respiratory tract infections in outpatient settings. It's not typically used for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) use, or acute emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosages should be adjusted based on patient factors like renal/hepatic function and coexisting medical conditions, particularly cardiovascular disease.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
* Dizziness, headache
* Dry mouth, nose, or throat
* Restlessness, insomnia
* Increased heart rate, palpitations
* Sweating


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (e.g., skin rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, trouble breathing)
* Hallucinations
* Seizures
* Irregular heartbeat
* Difficulty urinating

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term use of pseudoephedrine can potentially lead to tolerance, rebound congestion, and cardiovascular issues like elevated blood pressure and heart rate. Long-term bromhexine use is generally well-tolerated but gastrointestinal disturbances might continue.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Significant ADRs requiring urgent medical attention include severe allergic reactions, cardiac arrhythmias, significant changes in blood pressure, and neuropsychiatric effects like seizures and hallucinations.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to bromhexine, pseudoephedrine, or any component of the formulation.
* Severe hypertension
* Severe coronary artery disease
* History of stroke
* Severe renal impairment
* Concomitant use of or within 14 days of discontinuation of Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs).
* Angle-closure glaucoma
* Pheochromocytoma


## **Drug Interactions**

* **MAOIs:**  Concomitant use can cause hypertensive crisis.
* **Antihypertensives:** Pseudoephedrine may counteract the effects of antihypertensive medications.
* **Tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers:** May interact with pseudoephedrine affecting heart rate and blood pressure.
* **Decongestants, stimulants:**  Additive effects with pseudoephedrine might increase side effects.
* **Furazolidone, procarbazine:**  May interact with pseudoephedrine posing a risk of hypertensive crisis.
* **OTC cold/cough medications:** Many contain similar ingredients which may lead to overdose if combined.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pseudoephedrine is classified as Category C during pregnancy. It is generally not recommended during the first trimester and should be used with caution in later trimesters under physician supervision.  Bromhexine's safety during pregnancy is not fully established. Its use during pregnancy should be limited to cases where the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Pseudoephedrine can pass into breast milk. It is generally recommended to avoid using this combination while breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Bromhexine: Mucolytic; Pseudoephedrine: Decongestant.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, insomnia, increased heart rate, allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe hypertension/cardiac disease, MAOI use, severe renal impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** MAOIs, antihypertensives, some antidepressants.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks. Consult a physician.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 8 mg/60 mg every 4-6 hours (max 4 doses/24h).  Pediatric use not typically recommended except for patients older than 12.
