## **Usage**

Bromhexine + Salbutamol is prescribed for respiratory conditions where both mucus clearance and bronchodilation are required. This includes conditions like:

*   **Cough associated with respiratory disorders:**  Such as acute and chronic bronchitis, bronchial asthma, emphysema, bronchiectasis, whooping cough, and pneumonia.
*   **Other bronchopulmonary disorders:** Where bronchospasm, mucus plugging, and difficulty expectorating coexist.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

*   **Bromhexine:** Mucolytic, expectorant
*   **Salbutamol:** Bronchodilator, Beta2-adrenergic agonist

**Mechanism of Action:**

Bromhexine works by breaking down the structure of mucus, making it less viscous and easier to cough up. Salbutamol relaxes the smooth muscles in the airways, widening them and improving airflow.  The combination provides relief from cough and improves breathing by addressing both mucus congestion and airway constriction.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no officially recognized alternate generic names. However, the combination may be referred to as Salbutamol + Bromhexine in some regions.

**Brand Names:**  Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region. Some examples include Asmasol, Asthakind-DX, Brodilate, Duolin Inhaler, Salmodil, Ventolin, and others. These brand names might also contain other active ingredients in addition to Bromhexine and Salbutamol. 


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

*   **Bromhexine:** Decreases mucus viscosity, increases mucociliary clearance, and promotes expectoration.
*   **Salbutamol:** Relaxes bronchial smooth muscle, leading to bronchodilation and improved airflow to the lungs. It also inhibits mast cell degranulation, reducing the release of inflammatory mediators.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Bromhexine:**
    *   Absorption: Well-absorbed orally.
    *   Metabolism: Extensively metabolized in the liver.
    *   Elimination: Primarily via renal excretion.

*   **Salbutamol:**
    *   Absorption: Readily absorbed orally and by inhalation.
    *   Metabolism: Primarily metabolized in the liver to an inactive sulfate conjugate.
    *   Elimination: Excreted primarily in urine, partly as unchanged drug.

**Mode of Action:**

*   **Bromhexine:** Depolymerizes mucopolysaccharide fibers in mucus, reducing viscosity.
*   **Salbutamol:** Stimulates Beta2-adrenergic receptors in the lungs, activating adenylate cyclase, increasing intracellular cAMP levels, and leading to smooth muscle relaxation.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**

*   **Salbutamol:** Selectively binds to Beta2-adrenergic receptors.

**Elimination Pathways:**

*   **Bromhexine:** Primarily renal excretion.
*   **Salbutamol:** Primarily renal excretion, some biliary excretion.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Syrup: 10 ml (2 teaspoons) three times a day.  This may be adjusted based on patient response and tolerance.


#### **Children:**

Syrup:

* 6-12 years: 5-10 ml (1-2 teaspoons) three times a day.
* Below 6 years: 2.5-5 ml (1/2-1 teaspoon) three times a day.

Pediatric dosages should be carefully calculated based on weight or age, and the child's response to the medication should be closely monitored.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:**  Start with a lower dose and adjust as needed based on patient response and tolerance.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment might be necessary.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, and dose adjustment might be needed.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, and peptic ulcer, should be closely monitored for adverse effects. Dose adjustments might be required in certain cases.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific clinical settings should be individualized based on patient condition and response.  It is important to note that the use of Bromhexine + Salbutamol during intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations may require dose adjustments and close monitoring.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be needed in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.  The specific adjustment will depend on the severity of the impairment and the individual patient's response.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Nausea, vomiting, indigestion, diarrhea
*   Dizziness, headache
*   Tremor, palpitations, increased heart rate, muscle cramps
*   Dry mouth and throat irritation

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm)
*   Hypokalemia
*   Cardiac arrhythmias
*   Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis



### **Long-Term Effects:**

Prolonged use of Salbutamol can lead to tolerance and decreased effectiveness.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Clinically significant ADRs include severe allergic reactions, paradoxical bronchospasm, and significant changes in heart rate or blood pressure.



## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to Bromhexine or Salbutamol.
*   Pre-existing cardiac tachyarrhythmias.
*   Thyrotoxicosis.
*   Severe heart disease, irregular heartbeat, and severe high blood pressure.



## **Drug Interactions**

*   Beta-blockers: May reduce the effect of Salbutamol.
*   Diuretics: May increase the risk of hypokalemia.
*   Theophylline: May enhance the risk of adverse effects.
*   MAOIs and tricyclic antidepressants: May increase the risk of cardiovascular side effects.
*   Digoxin: Salbutamol may decrease serum digoxin levels.
*   Antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin): Bromhexine may increase antibiotic concentrations in bronchial secretions.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Bromhexine + Salbutamol should be used with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus or neonate. Salbutamol may delay the onset of labor. The safety of Bromhexine during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established. It is not known whether Salbutamol and Bromhexine are secreted in breast milk.
