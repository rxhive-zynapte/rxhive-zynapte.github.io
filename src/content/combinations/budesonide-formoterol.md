## **Usage**

Budesonide + Formoterol is prescribed for the maintenance treatment of asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older, and for the long-term treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults. It is **not** for the relief of acute bronchospasm.  This combination medication falls under the pharmacological classifications of:

* **Corticosteroid (Budesonide):**  Reduces airway inflammation.
* **Long-Acting Beta2-Adrenergic Agonist (Formoterol):** Relaxes and opens the airways.


The mechanism of action involves the synergistic effects of both drugs: budesonide reduces inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness, while formoterol promotes bronchodilation by relaxing the smooth muscles of the airways.

## **Alternate Names**

* International variations may exist.
* Popular brand names include Symbicort, Breyna (for Budesonide/Formoterol), and Breztri Aerosphere (for Budesonide/Glycopyrrolate/Formoterol).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Budesonide exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the airways, inhibiting inflammatory mediators. Formoterol, as a long-acting beta2-agonist, relaxes bronchial smooth muscle, leading to bronchodilation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Both drugs are absorbed through the lungs following inhalation.
* **Metabolism:**  Budesonide undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4 enzymes. Formoterol is also metabolized, but to a lesser extent.
* **Elimination:** Both drugs are eliminated primarily through hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion, with a small portion excreted renally.


**Mode of Action:**  Budesonide modulates gene expression to reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines and other mediators.  Formoterol activates beta2-adrenergic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle cells, leading to increased intracellular cAMP, muscle relaxation, and bronchodilation.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Budesonide binds to glucocorticoid receptors. Formoterol binds to beta2-adrenergic receptors. Budesonide metabolism involves CYP3A4 enzymes.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (Asthma and COPD):**

* Symbicort 80/4.5 mcg and 160/4.5 mcg:  Two inhalations twice daily (morning and evening).
* Symbicort Turbuhaler 200/6 mcg and DuoResp Spiromax: One inhalation twice daily. 
* Breztri Aerosphere (COPD): Two inhalations twice daily.

#### **Children (Asthma, 6 to 11 years):**

* Symbicort 80/4.5 mcg: Two inhalations twice daily.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustment is typically required.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is generally needed for mild to moderate impairment. For severe renal impairment, use with caution if the benefit outweighs the risk.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Monitor closely, as increased exposure is possible. Dose reduction may be considered in severe liver impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, seizures, osteoporosis, glaucoma, or infections.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Budesonide + Formoterol is **not** indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.  It's designed for maintenance treatment, not acute symptom relief.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary based on individual response and disease severity. In some cases, higher doses may be needed for more severe asthma or COPD.  Dosage should be titrated to the lowest effective dose.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

* Upper respiratory tract infections
* Headache
* Throat irritation, pain, or hoarseness
* Back pain
* Rhinitis (stuffy or runny nose)
* Oral candidiasis (thrush)


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Paradoxical bronchospasm
* Adrenal suppression
* Hyperglycemia
* Hypokalemia
* QT prolongation
* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, angioedema)


### **Long-Term Effects**

* Decreased bone mineral density
* Growth suppression in children (with high doses)
* Cataracts or glaucoma


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Worsening of asthma or COPD


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to budesonide, formoterol, or any of the excipients.
* Primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma or COPD.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** May increase systemic exposure to budesonide and increase the risk of side effects.
* **Beta-Blockers:** May antagonize the bronchodilating effects of formoterol and cause bronchospasm.
* **MAOIs and TCAs:** May potentiate the cardiovascular effects of formoterol.
* **Diuretics:** May potentiate hypokalemia and ECG changes.
* **Other Adrenergic Agents:** May potentiate sympathetic effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus.  
* **Breastfeeding:**  Budesonide is excreted in breast milk in small amounts.  Formoterol data is limited. Weigh the benefits of breastfeeding against potential risks to the infant. Consider discontinuing the drug or breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Budesonide: Anti-inflammatory. Formoterol: Bronchodilator.
* **Side Effects:** Headache, URTI, throat irritation, thrush, adrenal suppression (rare).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, acute asthma/COPD exacerbations.
* **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors, beta-blockers, MAOIs, TCAs, diuretics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; weigh benefits vs. risks.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 2 inhalations BID. Children (6-11): 2 inhalations of 80/4.5 mcg BID.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Asthma/COPD symptoms, lung function, blood pressure, potassium levels, blood glucose, bone mineral density (long-term use), growth in children.


## **Popular Combinations**

Budesonide/Formoterol is often used as a standalone therapy. However, short-acting beta2-agonists (SABAs) may be used concomitantly for acute symptom relief.  In some cases, other medications, such as montelukast, may be added for additional asthma control.



## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess for allergies, pre-existing conditions, and concomitant medications.
* **Specific Populations:** Monitor children for growth, pregnant/breastfeeding women for fetal/infant risk, and elderly for comorbid conditions.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Advise patients to avoid smoking and other respiratory irritants.
