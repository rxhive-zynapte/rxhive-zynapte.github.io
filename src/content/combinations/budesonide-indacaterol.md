## **Usage**

Budesonide + Indacaterol is prescribed for the **maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**, including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema.  It is *not* indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm or for the treatment of asthma.

This combination drug falls under the **pharmacological classifications**:

* **Corticosteroid (Budesonide):**  Reduces airway inflammation.
* **Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA) (Indacaterol):** Relaxes and opens the airways.

The **mechanism of action** involves two components:  Budesonide reduces inflammation in the airways, while Indacaterol relaxes the smooth muscles around the airways, leading to bronchodilation and improved airflow.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no officially recognized alternate generic name.  A common combination of these medications is marketed under the brand name **Atectura Breezhaler**.  

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Budesonide, a glucocorticoid, binds to glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm, translocates to the nucleus, and modulates gene transcription.  This leads to decreased inflammation by inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators.  Indacaterol, a LABA, stimulates beta2-adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle, activating adenylate cyclase and increasing intracellular cyclic AMP levels.  This results in smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Budesonide:** Administered via inhalation, Budesonide is absorbed into the lungs with limited systemic absorption.  It undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver via CYP3A4 enzymes.  Excretion is primarily through the feces.
* **Indacaterol:** Also inhaled, Indacaterol has a longer duration of action compared to other LABAs.  It is metabolized primarily by uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes and eliminated through the feces and urine.

**Receptor binding:** Budesonide binds to glucocorticoid receptors. Indacaterol binds to beta2-adrenergic receptors.

**Elimination pathways:**  Budesonide is eliminated through hepatic metabolism and fecal excretion.  Indacaterol is eliminated via UGT metabolism and both fecal and renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard dose for Atectura Breezhaler is one inhalation (containing 110 mcg budesonide, 110 mcg glycopyrrolate, and 55 mcg indacaterol) once daily, administered at the same time each day.

#### **Children:**

This combination is *not* recommended for use in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. For patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis, the drug can be used at the recommended dose only if the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Use with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, hypokalemia, narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hyperplasia, seizure disorders, and urinary retention.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Budesonide + Indacaterol (Atectura Breezhaler) is specifically indicated for the *maintenance treatment of COPD* and *not* for the clinical use cases listed (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations). Short-acting bronchodilators or other appropriate therapies should be used in these acute scenarios.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific dosage adjustments are indicated beyond those mentioned for special populations.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, cough, headache, back pain, and muscle spasms.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Pneumonia,  paradoxical bronchospasm, angioedema, hypersensitivity reactions, arrhythmias, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia,  and glaucoma.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Increased risk of osteoporosis, cataracts, adrenal suppression with prolonged use of inhaled corticosteroids.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, severe bronchospasm, and significant cardiovascular events.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to budesonide, indacaterol, or any component of the formulation. Primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of COPD. Co-administration with other long-acting beta2-agonists.

## **Drug Interactions**

Beta-adrenergic blockers,  strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole),  and some anticholinergics may interact with Budesonide + Indacaterol. Consult a drug interaction database for a complete list.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Budesonide + Indacaterol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Limited information is available regarding breastfeeding. However, budesonide is present in human milk at low levels. Caution is advised.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Budesonide: Anti-inflammatory (corticosteroid).  Indacaterol: Bronchodilator (LABA).
* **Side Effects:**  Common: Upper respiratory tract infection, cough, headache. Serious: Paradoxical bronchospasm, angioedema, arrhythmias.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, acute bronchospasm, concomitant LABA use.
* **Drug Interactions:** Beta-blockers, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, some anticholinergics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution.  Consult specialist.
* **Dosage:** One inhalation once daily.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Lung function (FEV1), blood glucose, potassium levels, eye examinations (for long-term use).


## **Popular Combinations**

Not applicable, as this is already a fixed-dose combination.


## **Precautions**

Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypercorticism, paradoxical bronchospasm, cardiovascular effects,  and worsening of underlying conditions (e.g., diabetes, glaucoma).
