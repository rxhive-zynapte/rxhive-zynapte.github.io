## **Usage**

Bupropion + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide is prescribed for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Atypical antidepressant; NMDA receptor antagonist and sigma-1 receptor agonist (dextromethorphan), aminoketone antidepressant and CYP2D6 inhibitor (bupropion).

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination therapy works through multiple pathways. Dextromethorphan acts primarily as an NMDA receptor antagonist, modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission, and also as a sigma-1 receptor agonist. Bupropion is a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) and also inhibits CYP2D6, increasing dextromethorphan levels.  The combined effect is thought to enhance the availability of glutamate, potentially improving mood and alleviating depressive symptoms, while also weakly affecting norepinephrine and dopamine levels.

## **Alternate Names**

The combination is not known by any other generic names. It is sometimes abbreviated as DXM/BUP.

**Brand Name:** Auvelity

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Dextromethorphan primarily antagonizes NMDA receptors and agonizes sigma-1 receptors. Bupropion inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine.  The combination is believed to primarily work by increasing glutamate availability, possibly influencing neuroplasticity and synaptic function related to mood regulation.  Bupropion also contributes through its effects on norepinephrine and dopamine, potentially increasing motivation and reducing anhedonia.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Both drugs are orally administered and absorbed. Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6, which is the primary enzyme responsible for metabolizing dextromethorphan, resulting in increased dextromethorphan plasma concentrations.  Both drugs and their metabolites are primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Dextromethorphan binds to and antagonizes NMDA receptors and binds to and activates sigma-1 receptors. Bupropion inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine and inhibits CYP2D6.

**Elimination Pathways:** Both drugs are predominantly metabolized by the liver and excreted through the kidneys.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Initial dose: One tablet (45 mg dextromethorphan hydrobromide and 105 mg bupropion hydrochloride) orally once daily in the morning for 3 days.

Maintenance dose: One tablet twice daily, taken at least 8 hours apart.  Do not exceed two tablets per day.

#### **Children:**

The safety and efficacy of Auvelity have not been established in pediatric patients. Use is not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Clinical trials did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults.  Close monitoring for adverse effects is recommended.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Mild renal impairment: No dosage adjustment is required. Moderate renal impairment: Initial and maintenance dose is one tablet once daily in the morning. Severe renal impairment: Use is not recommended.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Mild to moderate hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is required. Severe hepatic impairment: Use is not recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Carefully consider the patient's other conditions. Pre-screening for seizure disorders, eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, bulimia), bipolar disorder, and recent discontinuation of alcohol or sedatives/hypnotics is essential due to increased risks. Monitor blood pressure closely, especially in patients with hypertension.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Auvelity is specifically indicated for MDD and not recommended for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modification is necessary when Auvelity is co-administered with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors.  In such cases, the initial and maintenance dose should be one tablet once daily in the morning.  Concomitant use with strong CYP2B6 inducers should be avoided.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Dizziness, diarrhea, dry mouth, excessive sweating, headache, somnolence, sexual dysfunction (e.g., decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, anorgasmia).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Suicidal thoughts and behaviors (especially in young adults), serotonin syndrome, seizures, hypertension, hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome), neuropsychiatric reactions (hallucinations, delusions, paranoia).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

The long-term effects of Auvelity are still being studied.  Potential concerns include the development of tolerance, dependence, and chronic adverse effects like sexual dysfunction or cardiovascular issues.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Serious ADRs include serotonin syndrome, seizures, severe hypertension,  hypersensitivity reactions, and neuropsychiatric reactions. These require immediate medical attention.



## **Contraindications**

* Seizure disorder
* Eating disorder (anorexia nervosa, bulimia)
* Concurrent or recent (within 14 days) use of MAOIs
* Treatment with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue
* Hypersensitivity to dextromethorphan or bupropion

## **Drug Interactions**

Auvelity interacts with many drugs.  Significant interactions include:

* **MAOIs:** Concurrent use is contraindicated due to the risk of hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome.
* **CYP2D6 Inhibitors:**  Increase dextromethorphan levels; dose adjustment of Auvelity may be necessary.
* **CYP2B6 Inducers:** Decrease bupropion and dextromethorphan levels, potentially reducing efficacy.
* **Drugs that lower seizure threshold:** Increase seizure risk.
* **Alcohol:**  May increase the risk of seizures and other side effects.
* **Drugs with serotonergic effects:** Increase the risk of serotonin syndrome.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy:** Auvelity is not recommended during pregnancy due to potential fetal harm.  Advise patients to use effective contraception.  If pregnancy occurs, discontinue treatment and discuss potential risks with the patient.

**Breastfeeding:** Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for 5 days after the final dose due to the excretion of bupropion in breast milk.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  NMDA receptor antagonism, sigma-1 receptor agonism (dextromethorphan), NDRI, CYP2D6 inhibition (bupropion).
* **Side Effects:** Dizziness, diarrhea, dry mouth, sweating, headache, somnolence, sexual dysfunction.  Serious side effects include suicidal thoughts, seizures, serotonin syndrome, hypertension, hypersensitivity reactions.
