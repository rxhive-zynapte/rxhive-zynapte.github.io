## **Usage**

Revici Injection, a combination of butyl alcohol, citric acid, and sodium chloride, is primarily used to control and manage excessive bleeding.  It is classified as a hemostatic agent.  While the exact mechanism is not fully elucidated, it appears to strengthen blood vessel walls and improve platelet aggregation, thus promoting hemostasis and reducing re-bleeding episodes.

## **Alternate Names**

This specific combination doesn't have a widely recognized generic name or other alternate names. The product is commonly marketed under the brand name Revici Injection.  Individually, citric acid is also known as 2-hydroxy-1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid.  Butyl alcohol exists in several isomeric forms (n-butanol, isobutanol, sec-butanol, and tert-butanol).

## **How It Works**

The pharmacodynamics of this combination are not fully understood. The components likely contribute synergistically.  Butyl alcohol may act as a solvent and potentially exert anesthetic or sedative properties. Citric acid functions as a pH adjuster, ensuring optimal conditions for the other components. Sodium chloride maintains isotonicity with blood plasma, preventing cell lysis or shrinkage.

The pharmacokinetics of this combination have not been extensively studied. Information about absorption, metabolism, and elimination pathways for this specific mixture is limited.  Butyl alcohol is primarily metabolized in the liver. Citric acid participates in the Krebs cycle. Sodium chloride is excreted renally.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Revici Injection is administered as a 5ml intravenous injection by a healthcare professional.

#### **Children:**

Safety and efficacy have not been established in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution; dose adjustments may be necessary depending on individual health conditions.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution, and adjust the dosage based on the creatinine clearance rate.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Exercise caution due to the potential impact on butyl alcohol metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Assess the patient's condition thoroughly and adjust the dosage as needed, especially with cardiovascular disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The sources provided primarily describe the use of Revici Injection in controlling bleeding. Specific dosage recommendations for clinical situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations (e.g., cardiac arrest) are not detailed in the sources.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modification should be considered in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.  No information is available regarding the influence of metabolic disorders or genetic polymorphisms on drug metabolism.
