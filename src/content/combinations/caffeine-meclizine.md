## **Usage**

Caffeine + Meclizine is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness associated with motion sickness. It is also used to manage vertigo associated with vestibular system diseases.  Its pharmacological classifications are antihistamine (meclizine) and central nervous system stimulant (caffeine). Meclizine works by blocking histamine H1 receptors, thereby reducing the stimulation of the vestibular system and the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the brain, both of which are involved in motion sickness and vertigo. Caffeine is added to counteract the drowsiness that meclizine can cause.

## **Alternate Names**

No internationally recognized alternate names exist for the combination product itself. However, meclizine is sometimes referred to as meclozine. Brand names for products containing this combination may vary regionally.  Some brand names including meclizine are Antivert®, Bonine®, and Dramamine® Less Drowsy Formula (which contains meclizine with acetaminophen). Brand names that contain caffeine include Vivarin® and NoDoz®.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Meclizine acts as an antihistamine by blocking H1 receptors in the vestibular system of the inner ear and the vomiting center of the brain, thereby reducing nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Caffeine acts as a central nervous system stimulant, counteracting the sedative effects of meclizine.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:**  Meclizine is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations in about 1-3 hours. Caffeine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations occurring in about 30-60 minutes.
* **Metabolism:** Meclizine is extensively metabolized in the liver. Caffeine is primarily metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, specifically CYP1A2.
* **Elimination:** Meclizine metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine.  Caffeine is primarily excreted in the urine as metabolites.

**Mode of Action:** Meclizine exerts its effects by antagonizing H1 receptors, reducing the activity of the vestibular system.  Caffeine is an adenosine receptor antagonist, which leads to increased neuronal activity.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Motion Sickness:** 25 to 50 mg orally, taken one hour before travel.  May repeat dose every 24 hours as needed.
* **Vertigo:** 25 to 100 mg orally per day, divided into doses taken every 6-12 hours.


#### **Children:**

Use in children under 12 years of age is generally not recommended. For children 12 years and older, dosing for motion sickness or vertigo should be determined by a physician.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lowest recommended dose and increase gradually as needed due to increased sensitivity to anticholinergic effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution as drug and metabolite accumulation may occur. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution as hepatic impairment may increase systemic exposure to meclizine. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use cautiously in patients with asthma, glaucoma, prostatic hyperplasia, or other conditions that may be exacerbated by anticholinergic effects. 


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources do not recommend specific dosages for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. For these clinical cases, dosage adjustments should be made based on individual patient needs and overseen by a physician.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are needed for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  Elderly patients should generally begin at the lowest dose.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Drowsiness, dry mouth, headache, fatigue, blurred vision, constipation.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), difficulty breathing, changes in heart rate, seizures.


### **Long-Term Effects**

Limited information is available on the long-term effects.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to meclizine or caffeine.


## **Drug Interactions**

Alcohol, other CNS depressants (e.g., sedatives, hypnotics, opioids), anticholinergic drugs (e.g., atropine).



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Meclizine is considered to be relatively safe during pregnancy.  However, caffeine should be limited during pregnancy. It is unknown if meclizine is excreted in breast milk; caution is advised if breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Meclizine: H1 receptor antagonist; Caffeine: Adenosine receptor antagonist
* **Side Effects:** Drowsiness, dry mouth, headache, fatigue.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:** Alcohol, CNS depressants, anticholinergic drugs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Meclizine: Relatively safe; Caffeine: Limit intake.
* **Dosage:**  See detailed dosage section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for drowsiness, dizziness, and other CNS effects.


## **Popular Combinations**

The combination of meclizine and caffeine is itself a popular combination. Meclizine is often formulated with pyridoxine (vitamin B6), though not in this specific combination with caffeine.



## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:**  Assess for pre-existing conditions, including renal or hepatic impairment.
* **Specific Populations:** Caution should be taken in pregnant or breastfeeding women, and the elderly.  Use is generally not recommended for children under 12.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid alcohol and operating heavy machinery until the effects of the medication are known.
