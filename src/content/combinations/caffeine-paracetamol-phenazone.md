## **Usage**

- This drug is prescribed for the relief of mild to moderate pain and fever.  It is commonly used for headaches (including tension headaches and migraines), toothaches, menstrual cramps, muscular aches, back pain, arthritis pain, and symptoms of cold and flu.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Analgesic, Antipyretic
- **Mechanism of action:** This combination medication works through the synergistic action of its components. Paracetamol and phenazone reduce pain and fever by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis in the central nervous system.  Caffeine enhances the analgesic effect of paracetamol by increasing its absorption and reducing its metabolism. It also acts as a mild stimulant, promoting alertness and reducing fatigue, and constricts blood vessels, which can further contribute to pain relief, particularly in headaches.

## **Alternate Names**

- Paracetamol/Acetaminophen + Propyphenazone + Caffeine
- **Brand names:** Saridon, Dart, Trimol

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Paracetamol and phenazone inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, which are mediators of pain and fever, primarily in the central nervous system. Caffeine acts as a central nervous system stimulant and a vasoconstrictor.  It also increases paracetamol absorption and decreases its metabolism.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** All three components are absorbed well orally. Paracetamol is metabolized in the liver, primarily by glucuronidation and sulfation, with a small fraction undergoing CYP450-mediated metabolism to a reactive metabolite. Phenazone is also metabolized in the liver. Caffeine is metabolized by CYP1A2.  All three drugs are primarily eliminated renally.
- **Mode of action:** Paracetamol and phenazone act primarily by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the central nervous system, reducing prostaglandin synthesis. Caffeine's mechanism in pain relief is complex and not fully elucidated but involves adenosine receptor antagonism, phosphodiesterase inhibition, and calcium mobilization.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for all three components.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 1-2 tablets every 4-6 hours as needed.
- Maximum daily dose: Not to exceed 6 tablets in a 24-hour period.
- Typical formulation: 250mg paracetamol, 150mg phenazone (or propyphenazone), and 50mg caffeine per tablet.

#### **Children:**

- Not generally recommended for children under 12 years of age.
- Adolescents (12-16 years): 1 tablet every 4-6 hours as needed, not exceeding 3 tablets in 24 hours.
- Pediatric safety considerations: Monitor for caffeine-related side effects (insomnia, anxiety, increased heart rate). Consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosing.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lowest effective dose (1 tablet every 4-6 hours) due to potential age-related decline in hepatic and renal function. Monitor closely for adverse events.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction and careful monitoring are advised.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction and careful monitoring are recommended.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with heart disease, hypertension, peptic ulcers, and anxiety disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is not typically used in specific medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its use is generally limited to the outpatient management of mild to moderate pain and fever.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary based on individual patient factors such as renal/hepatic impairment, age, and other medical conditions.

## **Side Effects**

## **Drug Interactions**

- Alcohol: Avoid concomitant use due to increased risk of liver damage.
- Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin): May increase bleeding risk.
- Anticonvulsants (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin):  May alter metabolism of paracetamol.
- Metoclopramide, domperidone: May affect paracetamol absorption.
- Barbiturates: May reduce the effectiveness of paracetamol.
- Antibiotics (e.g., isoniazid, rifampicin): May interact with paracetamol metabolism.
- Anti-gout medications (e.g., probenecid): May affect renal excretion of paracetamol.
- Other medications containing paracetamol: Avoid concomitant use to prevent exceeding the maximum daily dose.
- Caffeine-containing products: Limit intake to avoid excessive caffeine consumption.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Contraindicated, especially during the first trimester and the last six weeks, due to potential fetal risks.
- **Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated as caffeine can be excreted in breast milk and affect the infant.
