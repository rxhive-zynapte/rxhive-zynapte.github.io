## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily used as a topical skin protectant and antiseptic. It is prescribed for minor skin irritations, including:

* **Nappy rash (diaper rash):** Protects the skin and soothes irritation.
* **Contact dermatitis:** Soothes inflammation and itching.
* **Minor burns, cuts, and abrasions:** Forms a protective barrier and aids healing.
* **Eczema:** Provides symptomatic relief.
* **Insect bites and stings:** Reduces itching and inflammation.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Topical protectant, antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, and antipruritic agent.

**Mechanism of Action:** The components work synergistically: Calamine soothes and relieves itching; Cetrimide acts as an antiseptic; Dimethicone forms a moisturizing barrier; Sucralfate creates a protective layer, and Zinc Oxide acts as a protectant and mild antiseptic.


## **Alternate Names**

Calamine-Cetrimide-Dimethicone-Sucralfate-Zinc Oxide cream/lotion. Several brand names exist (e.g., Sufrate, Norash Cream) depending on the manufacturer. International and regional variations may exist. There are no widely recognized proprietary names.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The combined action of its ingredients provides a comprehensive approach to skin irritation and protection. Calamine provides a soothing effect and helps relieve itching and inflammation. Cetrimide, an antiseptic, helps kill bacteria and fungi. Dimethicone forms a protective barrier, preventing further irritation. Sucralfate creates a protective layer over irritated skin promoting healing. Zinc oxide acts as a skin protectant, antiseptic, and mild astringent, creating a barrier against moisture and irritants.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Primarily for topical application, systemic absorption is minimal. Pharmacokinetic parameters like absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion are not clinically significant in typical use cases.  

**Mode of Action:** Calamine and Zinc oxide exert anti-inflammatory and astringent effects. Cetrimide disrupts bacterial cell membranes causing cell death.  Dimethicone creates a hydrophobic barrier, moisturizing skin and reducing transepidermal water loss. Sucralfate adheres to the skin, creating a physical barrier against irritants.
