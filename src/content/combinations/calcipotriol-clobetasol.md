## **Usage**

- Calcipotriol + Clobetasol is prescribed for the topical treatment of plaque psoriasis, a chronic skin condition characterized by thick, red patches with silvery scales.  It is particularly beneficial for patients who haven't responded adequately to other topical treatments.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antipsoriatic, Vitamin D analog combined with a high-potency corticosteroid.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Calcipotriol, a synthetic form of Vitamin D, works by inhibiting excessive skin cell production and promoting cell differentiation. Clobetasol, a corticosteroid, provides anti-inflammatory, antipruritic (anti-itch), and vasoconstrictive effects by blocking the production of prostaglandins, which contribute to inflammation and itching.

## **Alternate Names**

- Calcipotriene + Clobetasol Propionate
- **Brand Names:**  Various brand names exist depending on the region and manufacturer (e.g., Taclonex, Dovobet, Enstilar, Calpsor C).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The combination of calcipotriol and clobetasol provides a synergistic effect in treating psoriasis. Calcipotriol targets the underlying cause of excessive skin cell proliferation, while clobetasol reduces the associated inflammation and itching.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Both drugs are primarily absorbed topically. Systemic absorption is minimal with topical application, especially without occlusion.  Excessive or prolonged use over large areas, especially with occlusion, may lead to increased systemic absorption of clobetasol, potentially causing adverse effects like adrenal suppression or hypercalcemia (from calcipotriol).
- **Mode of Action:** Calcipotriol binds to vitamin D receptors in the skin, modulating gene expression and normalizing keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. Clobetasol binds to glucocorticoid receptors, inhibiting inflammatory pathways, including prostaglandin synthesis.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Calcipotriol binds to Vitamin D receptors. Clobetasol binds to glucocorticoid receptors.  Clobetasol also inhibits phospholipase A2, reducing arachidonic acid release and subsequent production of inflammatory mediators.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily metabolized and excreted via hepatic (liver) and renal (kidney) routes.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Apply a thin layer to affected areas once or twice daily as directed by the physician, typically for up to 4 weeks. Do not exceed 100g per week and avoid applying to more than 30% of the body surface area.


#### **Children:**

- Use and dose must be determined by the doctor.  Generally, not recommended for children under 12 years old.  Some formulations may be used in children older than 4 under strict medical supervision.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Similar to adult dosing but necessitates careful monitoring due to potential age-related changes in skin integrity and increased risk of systemic absorption.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution is advised; dose adjustments may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution; dose adjustments may be necessary depending on the severity of dysfunction.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor patients with diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease carefully due to the potential for clobetasol to affect blood sugar and blood pressure.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Calcipotriol + Clobetasol is specifically indicated for plaque psoriasis.  It is *not* used for:
