## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed to address nutritional deficiencies, particularly in conditions like osteomalacia, osteoporosis, rickets, and hypocalcemia. It's also recommended during pregnancy and lactation to support both maternal and fetal health.  It acts as a nutritional supplement.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no officially recognized alternate names for this specific combination. However, the individual components are sometimes referred to by other names:

* **Calcitriol:** 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3
* **Vitamin B6:** Pyridoxine
* **Methylcobalamin:**  Mecobalamin, Vitamin B12
* **Folic Acid:**  Vitamin B9, Folate


Brand names for products containing this combination vary widely. Some examples include "Calorex-M", "Coecoral Plus", "Sarvacal Plus", "Aditis Plus", and "Airacal-M".

## **How It Works**

This combination works through the synergistic action of its components:

* **Calcium Carbonate:** Provides a supplemental source of calcium, essential for bone mineralization, muscle function, and nerve transmission.
* **Calcitriol:**  The active form of vitamin D3, facilitates calcium and phosphorus absorption in the intestine, regulates calcium homeostasis, and contributes to bone health and cellular growth.
* **Folic Acid:**  Essential for DNA synthesis, cell division, and red blood cell formation. It's crucial for fetal development and preventing neural tube defects.
* **Methylcobalamin:**  An active form of vitamin B12, plays a vital role in nerve function, red blood cell production, DNA synthesis, and bone metabolism.
* **Vitamin B6:**  Involved in protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism, red blood cell formation, and neurotransmitter synthesis. Supports collagen formation and may alleviate pregnancy-related nausea.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Calcium carbonate absorption is influenced by vitamin D and various dietary factors.  Calcitriol undergoes hepatic metabolism.  Folic acid is absorbed in the small intestine. Methylcobalamin is absorbed via passive diffusion and active transport.  Vitamin B6 is readily absorbed and metabolized in the liver.  Elimination pathways vary for each component, involving both renal and hepatic routes.

## **Dosage**

Dosage varies depending on the specific formulation and the patient's individual needs. It's crucial to consult a physician and refer to the specific product labeling.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Generally, one to two capsules or tablets per day is recommended.  The optimal dosage depends on individual patient requirements and the specific product formulation.

#### **Children:**  Dosage should be determined by a pediatrician, considering the child's age, weight, and specific health conditions.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment may be necessary based on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is usually required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advised, and monitoring is essential.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage must be adjusted based on coexisting medical conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific clinical scenarios should be determined by the attending physician, considering the patient's condition and response to therapy. There is no fixed dosage for use cases such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on patient-specific factors, including renal and hepatic function, other medical conditions, and concomitant medications.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, stomach upset, diarrhea, constipation, loss of appetite.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Hypercalcemia, allergic reactions, sensory neuropathy (with high doses of vitamin B6).



### **Long-Term Effects:**

Potential for renal calculi with chronic excessive calcium intake. Sensory neuropathy with prolonged high doses of vitamin B6.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions (rare), hypercalcemic crisis.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any component, hypercalcemia, hypervitaminosis D, severe renal impairment, untreated vitamin B12 deficiency anemia, certain types of anemia.

## **Drug Interactions**

Antacids, certain antibiotics, bisphosphonates, levothyroxine, anticonvulsants,  folate antagonists (methotrexate), proton pump inhibitors, H2 blockers, drugs affecting bile acid metabolism, some diabetes medications.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Generally considered safe at recommended doses during pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, consultation with a physician is essential.  High doses of vitamin B6 during pregnancy can potentially cause seizures in newborns.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Synergistic action of components to address nutritional deficiencies, support bone health, and promote overall well-being.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, stomach upset, diarrhea, constipation, hypercalcemia (rare).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, hypercalcemia, hypervitaminosis D, severe renal impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Antacids, antibiotics, bisphosphonates, levothyroxine, anticonvulsants.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult a physician.
