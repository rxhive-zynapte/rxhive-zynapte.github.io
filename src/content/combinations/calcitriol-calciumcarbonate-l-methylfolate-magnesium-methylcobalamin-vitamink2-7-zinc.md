## **Usage**

This combination of Calcitriol, Calcium Carbonate, L-Methyl Folate, Magnesium, Methylcobalamin, Vitamin K2-7, and Zinc is primarily used as a dietary supplement to support bone health, nerve function, and overall well-being. It is often prescribed for conditions like osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and vitamin deficiencies.  It doesn't fit neatly into a single pharmacological classification but can be considered a nutritional supplement with components having effects relating to bone metabolism, vitamin supplementation, and nerve health. The components work synergistically to improve calcium absorption, bone mineralization, and nerve function.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication does not have a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN). It is often referred to by the names of its components or by brand names specific to manufacturers. Some brand names include "CALCIQ â€“ K2 7 PLUS", "BETERCAL K2 7", and "Swascal K2-7 Plus".

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** This combination product affects the body by supplementing essential nutrients involved in various physiological processes. Calcium and Vitamin D (Calcitriol) are crucial for bone health. Vitamin K2-7 directs calcium to the bones, preventing its deposition in soft tissues. Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B12) and L-Methyl Folate are vital for nerve function and DNA synthesis. Magnesium supports muscle and nerve function, while Zinc plays a role in immune function and cell growth.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Calcium carbonate is absorbed in the small intestine, enhanced by calcitriol. Calcitriol itself undergoes hepatic metabolism. Vitamin K2-7 is absorbed and transported with lipids. Methylcobalamin is absorbed and stored in the liver. L-Methyl folate is readily absorbed. Magnesium absorption varies depending on dietary intake. Zinc is absorbed in the small intestine. Elimination pathways vary for each component, but primarily involve renal and hepatic excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**  
#### **Adults:**  
The typical adult dosage is one capsule per day, taken orally with a meal. Some sources recommend twice daily administration.

#### **Children:**  
Pediatric dosing should be determined by a pediatrician based on the child's age, weight, and specific needs.

#### **Special Cases:**  
Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  Consult with a nephrologist or hepatologist, respectively, for appropriate dose modifications.  Dosage adjustments in the elderly and patients with comorbid conditions should be individualized based on their specific needs and health status.  

### **Clinical Use Cases**  
This combination is not typically used in acute clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**  
Dose modification should be considered in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, as well as those with certain metabolic disorders.
