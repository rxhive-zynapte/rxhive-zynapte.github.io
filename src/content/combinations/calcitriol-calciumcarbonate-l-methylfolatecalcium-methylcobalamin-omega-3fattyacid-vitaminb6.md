## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed as a nutritional supplement to address deficiencies in vitamin D, calcium, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B12, and folate. It is indicated for conditions such as osteoporosis, osteomalacia, rickets, and general nutritional deficiencies.  It also supports cardiovascular health and nervous system function.  It does not belong to a single pharmacological classification but rather encompasses several, including vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids.

The mechanism of action involves multiple pathways: calcium carbonate provides a source of calcium, while calcitriol (vitamin D) enhances calcium absorption.  L-methyl folate is involved in DNA synthesis and red blood cell formation. Methylcobalamin (vitamin B12) supports nerve function and cell metabolism. Omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective effects. Vitamin B6 contributes to various metabolic processes.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no single official alternate name for this specific combination. However, the individual components have various names. For example:

* **Calcitriol:** 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3
* **L-Methyl Folate Calcium:** Metafolin, Levomefolic acid calcium
* **Methylcobalamin:** Mecobalamin, Vitamin B12
* **Omega-3 fatty acid:**  Fish oil, EPA (Eicosapentaenoic acid) + DHA (Docosahexaenoic acid)
* **Vitamin B6:** Pyridoxine

Brand names vary widely depending on the manufacturer. Some examples from the provided sources include: Biocod-MX, Bon-D3 Max, Bonicor Max, Bonultra-Plus, Calcab, Calcineed Max, Calcyn Max, Calovil K 2-7, Koocal-forte, and Sarvacal-Plus.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  The combined effects of the components contribute to bone health, nerve function, cell metabolism, red blood cell formation, and cardiovascular health. Calcium and vitamin D work synergistically to maintain bone mineral density. Vitamin B12 and folate are essential for DNA synthesis and nerve function. Omega-3 fatty acids reduce inflammation and improve lipid profiles.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Calcium carbonate is absorbed in the small intestine, enhanced by vitamin D.  The other components are also absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract.
* **Metabolism:**  Vitamin D is metabolized in the liver and kidneys.  Folate is converted to its active form.  Omega-3 fatty acids are metabolized like other dietary fats.
* **Elimination:** Calcium is excreted primarily in the urine and feces.  Vitamin D metabolites are excreted in bile and urine.  Vitamin B12 is excreted in bile. Omega-3 metabolites are eliminated through various routes.

**Mode of Action:**  Calcitriol binds to vitamin D receptors, influencing calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Methylcobalamin is a cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA synthesis and nerve function. L-methyl folate participates in one-carbon metabolism, essential for cell division. Omega-3 fatty acids affect cell membrane fluidity and reduce inflammatory mediators. Vitamin B6 functions as a coenzyme in various metabolic reactions.


## **Dosage**

The dosage for this multi-component formulation is not standardized.  It depends on the specific product and the patient's individual needs. It's crucial to consult the product's prescribing information and adjust the dosage based on the patient's age, health condition, and response to therapy.
