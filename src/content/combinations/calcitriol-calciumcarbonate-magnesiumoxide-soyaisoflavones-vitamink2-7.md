## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.  It addresses calcium deficiency and supports bone health in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.  This time period is marked by reduced estrogen production, which contributes to bone loss.  It's classified as a dietary supplement, combining vitamins, minerals, and nutrients.  It works by increasing Vitamin D and calcium levels, improving calcium absorption, and promoting bone formation.  Soya isoflavones contribute by mimicking estrogen's beneficial effects on bone health and potentially reducing menopausal symptoms. Vitamin K2-7 plays a vital role in directing calcium into bones, ensuring bone mineralization and maintaining bone density.  Magnesium aids in normal muscle function.

## **Alternate Names**

While this specific combination might not have a distinct international nonproprietary name (INN), its individual components do. Variations in the name may occur due to regional differences.  Some brand names under which similar formulations are marketed include: Bio-D3 Fem, SOYA-K27, and Sagecal-K27.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D3, acts on the intestines to increase calcium and phosphate absorption. It also stimulates bone resorption by osteoclasts (releasing calcium into the bloodstream) and increases renal calcium reabsorption. Calcium carbonate provides a source of elemental calcium, supporting bone mineralization. Soya isoflavones, as phytoestrogens, bind to estrogen receptors, exerting weak estrogenic effects beneficial for bone health and potentially reducing menopausal symptoms. Vitamin K2-7 (menaquinone-7) activates osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein, promoting calcium deposition in bone and inhibiting vascular calcification.  Magnesium is vital for muscle and nerve function, bone formation, and energy metabolism.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Calcitriol is absorbed from the gut.  Calcium carbonate's absorption is influenced by various factors, including vitamin D status and the presence of other food components. Soya isoflavones are metabolized by gut bacteria. Vitamin K2-7 is absorbed and transported with lipoproteins.  Magnesium is absorbed in the small intestine.  The combined components are metabolized and excreted through various pathways, primarily renal and hepatic.
