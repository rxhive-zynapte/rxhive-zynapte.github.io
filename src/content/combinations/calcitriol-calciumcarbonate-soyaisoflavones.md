## **Usage**

- This combination drug is primarily prescribed for the dietary management of postmenopausal osteoporosis (weak and brittle bones) and osteopenia (low bone mineral density). It may also be used to address calcium and vitamin D deficiency and alleviate menopausal symptoms.
- **Pharmacological classification**: This is a combination product containing a vitamin D analog (Calcitriol), a calcium supplement (Calcium Carbonate), and a phytoestrogen (Soya Isoflavones).
- **Mechanism of action**: Calcitriol enhances calcium absorption in the gut, Calcium Carbonate provides supplemental calcium, and Soya Isoflavones exert mild estrogenic effects that help maintain bone density.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names for this specific combination exist.
- **Brand names**: Shelcal ISO, Calcimax ISO, Bio-D3 Fem, Nucifria-XT, Supracal ISO, Calorex-XL, Osteofit XT.  Please note that formulations may vary slightly between brands and some brands may include additional ingredients such as magnesium, vitamin K2-7, and boron.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D3, binds to vitamin D receptors, increasing calcium absorption from the gut and regulating bone metabolism. Calcium Carbonate directly increases calcium stores. Soya Isoflavones act as weak estrogens, influencing bone turnover by modulating osteoblast and osteoclast activity.
- **Pharmacokinetics**: Calcitriol is readily absorbed orally, undergoes hepatic metabolism, and is excreted primarily through the kidneys. Calcium Carbonate's absorption varies depending on factors like vitamin D status and gastric pH. Soya Isoflavones are metabolized by gut bacteria and undergo hepatic conjugation. Elimination pathways are mainly renal and hepatic.
- **Mode of action**: Calcitriol interacts with vitamin D receptors (VDR) within cells. Calcium Carbonate releases calcium ions. Soya Isoflavones act as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), although their primary influence on bone health is less clear.
- **Elimination pathways**: Calcitriol: renal and hepatic. Calcium Carbonate: primarily fecal, some renal. Soya Isoflavones: hepatic and renal.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The typical dosage is one capsule or tablet daily, taken with a meal. Dosage should be determined by a healthcare professional on the basis of individual patient requirements and serum vitamin D and calcium levels.

#### **Children:**

- This combination is generally not recommended for children under 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: Dosage adjustments may be needed due to changes in renal function. Close monitoring of calcium levels is essential.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Dose reduction or avoidance might be needed due to impaired calcitriol metabolism.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**:  Caution is recommended, although significant dosage adjustments are not usually required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypercalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, kidney stones, certain cancers, or malabsorption syndromes.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is not typically used in acute clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its primary use is in the long-term management of osteoporosis.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on renal function, vitamin D and calcium levels, and individual patient response.
