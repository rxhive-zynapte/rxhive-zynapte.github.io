## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the management and treatment of conditions related to calcium and vitamin D deficiency, such as osteoporosis, osteomalacia (rickets in children), and hypoparathyroidism. It's also used as an adjunct in managing secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients undergoing renal dialysis.  Some formulations also include additional ingredients (like zinc, magnesium, methylcobalamin or folic acid) that act synergistically to promote bone health, nerve function and cell metabolism.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Vitamin and Mineral Supplement.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination works by increasing calcium absorption, promoting bone formation, and improving bone density. Calcitriol (the active form of vitamin D3) enhances the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. Calcium carbonate provides a source of elemental calcium necessary for bone mineralization. Vitamin K2-7 (menaquinone-7) helps to direct calcium into the bones and prevent its deposition in soft tissues like blood vessels.


## **Alternate Names** 

- There is no officially recognized alternate name for this specific combination. However, it may be referred to by various descriptions reflecting its components, such as "calcium, vitamin D3, and vitamin K2-7 supplement." 
- **Brand Names:** Several brand names exist for this combination, with formulations often including additional ingredients. Brand names often include variations of "Cal" "Vit D" "K2" and sometimes also "Zinc", "Mg" and "B12" depending on specific content.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Calcitriol acts on the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the intestine, kidneys, and bone to regulate calcium and phosphate homeostasis. It increases intestinal calcium absorption, promotes renal calcium reabsorption, and mobilizes calcium from bone. Calcium carbonate provides a readily absorbable source of calcium. Vitamin K2-7 activates osteocalcin, a protein that binds calcium to the bone matrix, and matrix Gla protein (MGP), which inhibits calcium deposition in blood vessels.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Calcitriol is absorbed from the small intestine and undergoes hepatic metabolism. Calcium carbonate is absorbed via an active, vitamin D-dependent transport mechanism.  Vitamin K2-7 is absorbed in the presence of bile salts. All components are metabolized in the liver and eliminated through renal and biliary excretion.
