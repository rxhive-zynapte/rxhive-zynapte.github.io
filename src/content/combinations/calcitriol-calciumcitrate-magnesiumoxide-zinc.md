## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed to prevent or treat deficiencies in vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, and zinc. It's primarily used for managing conditions related to low levels of these nutrients, such as:

* **Hypocalcemia:** Low blood calcium levels
* **Osteoporosis:**  A condition characterized by weakened bones and increased risk of fractures.
* **Osteomalacia/Rickets:** Softening of the bones due to vitamin D deficiency.
* **Hypoparathyroidism:** Decreased activity of the parathyroid gland.
* **Latent Tetany:** A muscle disease caused by low calcium levels.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This combination falls under the category of dietary supplements and minerals/vitamins.


## **Alternate Names**

There are no officially recognized alternate names for this specific combination. However, each individual component has its own synonyms:

* **Calcitriol:** 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3
* **Calcium Citrate:** Calcium citrate tetrahydrate
* **Magnesium Oxide:** Magnesia, Periclase
* **Zinc:**  Zinc sulfate, Zinc gluconate, Zinc acetate (depending on the specific zinc salt used).


Brand names can vary depending on the manufacturer.  One identified brand name is Calciva.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Calcitriol:** The active form of vitamin D, calcitriol, works by binding to vitamin D receptors in the intestines, kidneys, and bones. This action increases calcium and phosphorus absorption from the gut, decreases calcium loss from the kidneys, and promotes bone mineralization. Calcitriol also plays a role in regulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) production.
* **Calcium Citrate:**  Provides elemental calcium, essential for maintaining bone mass and density, nerve and muscle function, and blood clotting.
* **Magnesium Oxide:** Provides magnesium, a crucial mineral for bone mineralization, normal bone crystal formation, nerve and muscle function, and numerous enzymatic reactions.  Magnesium also contributes to activating vitamin D, further enhancing calcium absorption.
* **Zinc:** Essential trace mineral involved in bone growth and mineralization, immune function, and collagen synthesis.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Calcitriol:** Absorbed in the small intestine. Metabolized in the liver and kidneys. Eliminated through bile and feces.
* **Calcium Citrate:**  Absorbed in the small intestine, particularly in the presence of vitamin D. Primarily excreted in the urine and feces.
* **Magnesium Oxide:** Absorbed in the small intestine and colon. Excreted primarily by the kidneys.
* **Zinc:** Primarily absorbed in the small intestine.  Excreted primarily in feces, with small amounts in urine.
