## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for conditions related to vitamin and mineral deficiencies, particularly those affecting bone health, nerve function, and overall well-being.  It may be used in conditions such as osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and rickets. It may also be prescribed to support overall health, particularly nerve function, red blood cell production, and immune system modulation.  This is not a single pharmacological class drug, but rather a combination of supplements, vitamins, and minerals, each belonging to different classifications.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication does not have a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN). It is often referred to by the names of its individual components. Brand names vary regionally; examples include Lycorixx-Ultra, Build-D3 Max, and Citmoss Forte.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  This combination product exerts its effects through the combined actions of its individual components.

* **Calcitriol:**  The active form of vitamin D, calcitriol regulates calcium and phosphate absorption, promoting bone mineralization.
* **Calcium Citrate Malate:** Provides calcium, essential for bone health, muscle function, and nerve transmission. This form of calcium is highly bioavailable.
* **L-Methyl Folate:** The active form of folic acid, essential for DNA synthesis, cell division, and red blood cell formation.
* **Lycopene:** An antioxidant that protects cells from damage caused by free radicals.
* **Magnesium Sulphate:** Magnesium is crucial for various bodily functions, including muscle and nerve function, blood pressure regulation, and blood glucose control.
* **Methylcobalamin:**  The active form of vitamin B12, vital for nerve function, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell formation.
* **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:**  These essential fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and support cardiovascular health.
* **Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate:**  The active form of Vitamin B6, it plays a role in brain development and function and the synthesis of neurotransmitters.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The absorption, metabolism, and elimination of each component vary:

* **Calcitriol:** Absorbed in the small intestine, metabolized in the liver and kidneys.
* **Calcium Citrate Malate:** Absorbed in the small intestine, influenced by vitamin D levels.
* **L-Methyl Folate:** Absorbed in the small intestine.
* **Lycopene:** Absorbed better with dietary fats, metabolized in the liver.
* **Magnesium Sulphate:** Absorbed in the small intestine, excreted renally.
* **Methylcobalamin:** Absorbed in the small intestine, stored in the liver.
* **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Absorbed in the small intestine, incorporated into cell membranes.
* **Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate:** Absorbed in the small intestine.
