## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the management and prevention of deficiencies in vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, and zinc. It is also used in the treatment of osteoporosis, osteomalacia, rickets, latent tetany, and hypoparathyroidism.  It is sometimes used as an adjunct in managing secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients undergoing renal dialysis.  This combination falls under the pharmacological classification of vitamins and minerals, or more accurately, as a dietary supplement.

The mechanism of action involves several components working synergistically:
* **Calcitriol**, the active form of vitamin D3, enhances intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate.  It also stimulates osteoclasts for calcium reabsorption from bone and promotes renal calcium reabsorption.
* **Calcium citrate malate** is a readily absorbed calcium salt crucial for bone mineralization and various biochemical functions.
* **Magnesium** regulates calcium levels and is vital for energy production and muscle function.
* **Vitamin K2-7 (menaquinone-7)** activates proteins like osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein, which facilitate calcium incorporation into bones and prevent vascular calcification.
* **Zinc** contributes to cell growth, immune function, and wound healing.


## **Alternate Names**

No specific alternate names for this exact combination are mentioned in the sources. Individual components may be referred to by their chemical names (e.g., cholecalciferol for vitamin D3) or by other forms of vitamin K2 (menaquinone).  Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer. Some mentioned include *Bone C Max K2 Tablet* and *Bonultra Tablet 10*, though these don't necessarily contain all five components.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** This combination exerts its effects by influencing calcium and phosphate homeostasis, bone metabolism, muscle and nerve function, and immune function. Calcitriol regulates calcium absorption and utilization, while calcium and magnesium are crucial for bone structure and function. Vitamin K2-7 directs calcium towards bone deposition and prevents its deposition in soft tissues. Zinc supports immune function and various enzymatic processes.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:**  Calcitriol is absorbed in the small intestine. Calcium citrate malate is also absorbed in the small intestine. Magnesium absorption occurs primarily in the small intestine and colon.  Zinc absorption takes place primarily in the small intestine.  Vitamin K2-7 absorption follows the path of fats.
* **Metabolism:** Calcitriol undergoes hepatic metabolism.  The other components are not significantly metabolized.
* **Elimination:** Calcitriol and its metabolites are primarily excreted via bile and feces, with some renal excretion. Calcium is excreted mainly through urine and feces. Magnesium is excreted mainly in urine. Zinc is primarily excreted in feces. Vitamin K2-7 is primarily excreted in bile and feces.

**Mode of Action:** Calcitriol binds to and activates vitamin D receptors in the intestine, kidneys, parathyroid gland, and bone.  This leads to increased calcium absorption and reabsorption. Calcium and magnesium contribute to bone mineralization, while vitamin K2-7 activates proteins that incorporate calcium into the bone matrix. Zinc participates in numerous enzymatic reactions.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Calcitriol acts through vitamin D receptors.  The other components do not exhibit specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  A common dosage recommendation found is one tablet daily, taken with or after meals. It may also reduce gastrointestinal discomfort when taken with food. Some formulations recommend 1-2 softgels.  Dosage, however, should be determined by a healthcare professional based on individual patient needs.
