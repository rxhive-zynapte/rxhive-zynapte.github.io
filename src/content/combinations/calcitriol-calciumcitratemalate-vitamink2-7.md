## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the management and prevention of calcium and vitamin D deficiencies. It is also used in the treatment of conditions associated with low calcium levels, such as:

* **Osteoporosis:** A condition characterized by weakened and brittle bones.
* **Osteomalacia/Rickets:** Softening of the bones due to vitamin D deficiency.
* **Hypoparathyroidism:**  A condition where the parathyroid glands do not produce enough parathyroid hormone, leading to low calcium levels.
* **Latent Tetany:** A muscle disease associated with low blood calcium.
* **Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in Renal Dialysis Patients:**  High levels of parathyroid hormone due to impaired kidney function.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Vitamin and Mineral Supplement

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination works by supplementing the body with essential nutrients for bone health. Calcitriol (active form of vitamin D3) increases calcium absorption in the intestine and regulates calcium and phosphate levels in the blood. Calcium citrate malate provides a readily absorbable form of calcium for bone mineralization. Vitamin K2-7 (menaquinone-7) helps direct calcium towards the bones, improving bone density, and inhibits calcium deposition in blood vessels.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no officially recognized alternate names. However, it may be referred to as Calcium + Calcitriol + Vitamin K2-7 or similar variations.

**Brand Names:** Several brand names exist for this combination, depending on the manufacturer and specific formulation (e.g., Avical, Calday-C, Bonetuf, Strongcal-CM, Vicavit K2-7, CELLOMAX K27,  C-More K2, Glocal K2, ADITIS-K27, SHINEPATH, Calwart K2). 

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Calcitriol:** Binds to vitamin D receptors, increasing intestinal calcium absorption, regulating calcium and phosphate homeostasis, and promoting bone mineralization.
* **Calcium Citrate Malate:** Provides calcium ions for bone formation, nerve function, muscle contraction, and blood clotting.
* **Vitamin K2-7:** Activates osteocalcin (bone protein), promoting calcium binding in bone matrix, and inhibits matrix Gla protein, preventing vascular calcification.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Calcitriol:** Absorbed from the intestine, metabolized in the liver and kidneys, and excreted in bile and urine.
* **Calcium Citrate Malate:** Absorbed from the intestine, influenced by vitamin D and dietary factors, and excreted in urine and feces.
* **Vitamin K2-7:** Absorbed from the intestine, metabolized in the liver, and excreted in bile and urine.

**Receptor Binding:** Calcitriol binds to vitamin D receptors.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal and hepatic excretion for all components.

## **Dosage**

Dosage guidelines vary by product and patient condition. Consult a healthcare professional for personalized recommendations. The following is general information and should not be considered medical advice. This information is deemed accurate, but might change. 

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Typical dosage is one or two softgel capsules or tablets daily, taken after a meal, or as directed by a physician. Some formulations recommend 0.25 mcg of calcitriol twice daily.

#### **Children:** Dosage should be determined by a pediatrician based on the child's age, weight, and specific condition.

#### **Special Cases:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient factors, including:

* **Elderly Patients:** Monitor renal function and adjust dosage as needed.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Lower doses may be required. Close monitoring of calcium and phosphate levels is essential.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Careful monitoring is advised, and dosage adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized dosage adjustments based on specific conditions like diabetes or cardiovascular disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific clinical settings should be determined by the attending physician based on the patient's condition and response to therapy. There are no established standard dosages for this combination in these scenarios:

* **Intubation**
* **Surgical Procedures**
* **Mechanical Ventilation**
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
* **Emergency Situations**


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on serum calcium, phosphate, creatinine, and PTH levels, as well as the patient's clinical response.
