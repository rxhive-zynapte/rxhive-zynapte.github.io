## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** This combination is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels) in patients with insufficient dietary calcium intake. Specific conditions include:
    - Osteoporosis (bone loss)
    - Osteomalacia/rickets (weak bones)
    - Hypoparathyroidism (decreased parathyroid gland activity)
    - Latent tetany (a muscle disease)
    - Renal osteodystrophy (bone disease in chronic kidney failure)
    - Postmenopausal osteoporosis
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Vitamin and mineral supplement, calcium regulator, vitamin D analog.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Calcitriol (active form of vitamin D3) increases calcium absorption from the gut and kidneys, regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis, and stimulates bone mineralization. Calcium citrate malate provides a readily absorbable source of calcium to support these processes.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names for the combination product itself, although individual components have various synonyms (e.g., vitamin D3 for cholecalciferol).
- Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer (e.g., Caltrate + D, Os-Cal + D, Citracal + D).  Some popular combinations marketed in India are:
 - CCM tablets.
 - Calcirol sachet.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Calcitriol binds to vitamin D receptors, modulating gene expression and influencing calcium and phosphate transport in the intestines, kidneys, and bones. Calcium citrate malate provides the necessary calcium for bone mineralization and other physiological processes.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - **Absorption:** Calcitriol is absorbed orally. Calcium citrate malate absorption is enhanced by vitamin D3. Food can also enhance absorption of both components.
    - **Metabolism:** Calcitriol undergoes hepatic and renal metabolism. Calcium is not metabolized in the traditional sense but is regulated by homeostatic mechanisms.
    - **Elimination:** Calcitriol metabolites are excreted primarily in bile. Calcium is excreted through urine and feces.
- **Mode of Action:** Calcitriol's effects are mediated through vitamin D receptor binding, which regulates gene transcription related to calcium and phosphate transport. Calcium citrate malate doesn't have a specific receptor but acts as a substrate for bone mineralization and other calcium-dependent processes.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**  Calcitriol binds to vitamin D receptors (VDR). No significant enzyme inhibition is associated with this combination.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Calcitriol is excreted in bile. Calcium is eliminated in urine and feces.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Varies depending on indication and individual patient needs.
- Typical starting dose: Calcitriol 0.25 mcg daily, with appropriate calcium supplementation.
- Maintenance dose: adjusted based on serum calcium levels and therapeutic response.
- Maximum dose: varies depending on the condition being treated.

#### **Children:**

- Dosing based on age and weight. Pediatric use should be supervised by a physician.
- Safety considerations: careful monitoring of serum calcium levels is essential.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Monitor renal function. Adjust dosage as needed.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be needed. Closely monitor calcium and phosphorus levels.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Close monitoring is advised, but significant dose adjustments are usually not necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and other conditions may require individual dose adjustments.  Consult with a physician to determine the appropriate dosage.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing in these settings requires careful evaluation and individualized therapy based on the patient's condition and response. Consult with a physician regarding the appropriate usage and dosage of this medication in intensive care unit settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Renal or hepatic impairment, hypercalcemia, and concomitant medications require careful monitoring and dose modifications.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Thiazide diuretics (increased risk of hypercalcemia).
- Digoxin (calcium can alter its effects).
- Corticosteroids (may reduce calcium absorption).
- Antacids containing magnesium or aluminum (reduced calcium absorption).
- Tetracycline antibiotics, bisphosphonates, estramustine, levothyroxine, and quinolone antibiotics (calcium can reduce their absorption)
- Bile acid sequestrants, mineral oil, orlistat (reduce vitamin D absorption).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Use only if clearly needed, as high doses of vitamin D can have adverse effects on the fetus.
- **Breastfeeding:** Use with caution. Monitor serum calcium in both mother and infant. The decision to use while breastfeeding requires careful consideration of risks and benefits.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
