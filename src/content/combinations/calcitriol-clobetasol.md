## **Usage**

Calcitriol + Clobetasol is prescribed for the topical treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults and children over 12 years of age.  It is a combination medication belonging to the pharmacological classifications of corticosteroids (Clobetasol) and vitamin D analogs (Calcitriol). This combination exerts a synergistic effect by suppressing the immune response, reducing inflammation, and normalizing skin cell growth and differentiation.

## **Alternate Names**

While no specific alternate generic names exist, Calcitriol + Clobetasol contains Calcitriol (also known as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) and Clobetasol Propionate. Brand names may vary regionally. Calcipotriol is often used in combination with Clobetasol.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Calcitriol, a synthetic form of vitamin D3, binds to vitamin D receptors in the skin, inhibiting keratinocyte proliferation and promoting differentiation. Clobetasol propionate, a super-potent topical corticosteroid, exerts anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive effects by suppressing the immune response and reducing pro-inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins. This combined action targets the underlying pathology of psoriasis.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Topical application limits systemic absorption. However, some percutaneous absorption of both drugs can occur. Clobetasol is metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted via the kidneys. Calcitriol undergoes hepatic metabolism and is eliminated through both renal and biliary routes. The extent of absorption depends on factors like the application site, skin condition, and use of occlusive dressings.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a thin film of Calcitriol + Clobetasol ointment or cream to the affected area twice daily, once in the morning and once at night.  Do not exceed a total weekly dose of 50g (50 mL or 1.75 fl oz). The duration of treatment is typically two weeks initially, but the healthcare professional should monitor the progress.

#### **Children:**

Use in children under 12 years of age is generally not recommended due to increased risk of HPA axis suppression and other systemic side effects. 

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: Elderly patients may be more susceptible to side effects and require closer monitoring for systemic effects of corticosteroids. Dosage adjustments may be considered based on patient-specific factors.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Renal impairment may increase the risk of systemic adverse reactions by altering the metabolic and excretion pathways of both drugs. Close monitoring of kidney function and appropriate dosage modifications are necessary. 

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Caution is advised in patients with hepatic impairment, as it may influence drug metabolism. Patients with liver disease should use this medication with careful consideration of the individual's condition, risk factors, and potential implications. 

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Close monitoring is advised for patients with comorbid conditions like diabetes due to the potential of corticosteroids to affect glucose levels, and in any infections (viral, bacterial, or fungal) of the affected area.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Calcitriol + Clobetasol is intended solely for topical treatment of plaque psoriasis and is not suitable for:

- Intubation
- Surgical Procedures
- Mechanical Ventilation
- Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use
- Emergency Situations

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, comorbid conditions, or other patient-specific factors influencing drug metabolism or clearance. Regular monitoring of serum calcium levels and signs of adrenal suppression is crucial, particularly with prolonged use.





## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**
Burning or stinging sensation, itching, redness, and dryness at the application site.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Skin atrophy, telangiectasia, striae, folliculitis, hypertrichosis, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and systemic effects of corticosteroids (e.g., HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia) with prolonged or excessive use.

### **Long-Term Effects**
Skin thinning, easy bruising, and increased susceptibility to infections with chronic use. Systemic side effects are also possible with prolonged and excessive use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Severe allergic reactions, skin infections, and signs of Cushing's syndrome.





## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any of the components. Rosacea, acne, perioral dermatitis, viral (e.g., herpes simplex, varicella zoster), fungal, bacterial, or parasitic skin infections.  Tuberculosis or syphilis of the skin.  Hypercalcemia or vitamin D toxicity.


## **Drug Interactions**

No documented drug-food or drug-alcohol interactions.  Concurrent use with other topical medications, especially corticosteroids, should be avoided unless directed by a physician.  Systemic corticosteroids or other drugs that affect calcium metabolism may interact with Calcitriol.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category: C (consult the latest available resources).  Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus or infant. If use is deemed necessary during breastfeeding, avoid applying to areas where the infant might come into contact.
