## **Usage**

This combination of Calcitriol, Coral calcium, Docosahexanoic acid (DHA), Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA), Folic Acid, L-Methyl Folate, Magnesium Oxide, Methylcobalamin, Vitamin B6, Vitamin K2-7, and Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to address deficiencies in these vitamins and minerals. It's prescribed when dietary intake alone is insufficient to meet the body's needs.  While some of the individual components have specific therapeutic uses, this particular combination is generally intended for broad nutritional support.

It falls under the pharmacological classification of a **nutritional supplement**.

The mechanism of action involves providing essential nutrients to support various physiological processes, including bone health, nerve function, red blood cell formation, and overall metabolic function.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination product doesn't have a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN) or other standard names.  It's typically referred to by its component ingredients.  Brand names for products containing these ingredients vary. Biocod-MX is one example of a brand name that contains this drug combination.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  This combination exerts its effects through the individual actions of its components:

* **Calcitriol:** The active form of vitamin D, regulates calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, crucial for bone health.
* **Coral Calcium:** A source of calcium carbonate, contributes to bone structure and other calcium-dependent functions.
* **DHA and EPA:** Omega-3 fatty acids with anti-inflammatory properties, support cardiovascular and cognitive health.
* **Folic Acid and L-Methyl Folate:**  Essential for DNA synthesis and cell division, vital during periods of rapid growth and for red blood cell formation. L-Methylfolate is the active form of folic acid.
* **Magnesium Oxide:**  Supports various enzymatic reactions, muscle and nerve function.
* **Methylcobalamin:** The active form of Vitamin B12, crucial for nerve function and red blood cell formation.
* **Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine):** Involved in various metabolic processes, including neurotransmitter synthesis.
* **Vitamin K2-7:**  Plays a role in calcium metabolism and bone health.
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:**  Supports immune function, wound healing, and cell growth.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  The absorption, metabolism, and elimination of each component differ:

* **Calcitriol:** Absorbed in the small intestine, metabolized in the liver and kidneys.
* **Coral Calcium:** Absorbed in the gut, influenced by factors like vitamin D levels.
* **DHA and EPA:**  Absorbed in the small intestine, incorporated into cell membranes.
* **Folic Acid and L-Methyl Folate:** Absorbed in the small intestine.
* **Magnesium Oxide:**  Absorbed in the gut, excreted renally.
* **Methylcobalamin:** Absorbed in the ileum, stored in the liver.
* **Vitamin B6:** Absorbed in the small intestine, metabolized in the liver.
* **Vitamin K2-7:**  Absorbed in the small intestine, metabolized in the liver.
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:** Absorbed in the small intestine, excreted through the gastrointestinal tract and urine.


## **Dosage**

Dosage will vary depending on the specific product and the individual patient's needs.  Always refer to the manufacturer's prescribing information. Since this is a combination of several ingredients, dosing is complex and needs to be individualized.

### **Standard Dosage**

## **Side Effects**

Side effects are generally related to the individual components and are usually mild.


### **Common Side Effects**

Gastrointestinal issues such as constipation or diarrhea may occur, primarily due to the calcium and magnesium components.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Hypercalcemia (high calcium levels) is a potential concern with excessive vitamin D and calcium intake.

## **Contraindications**

Contraindications are specific to the individual components. For example, patients with hypercalcemia should avoid excessive vitamin D and calcium intake.

## **Drug Interactions**

Drug interactions are also component-specific. For example, vitamin K can interact with anticoagulants.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

While generally considered safe in recommended doses, consulting a healthcare professional before using this combination during pregnancy or breastfeeding is essential.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

See above for a summary of each component's mechanism of action, side effects, contraindications, and drug interactions. Dosing is highly individualized.


## **Popular Combinations**
