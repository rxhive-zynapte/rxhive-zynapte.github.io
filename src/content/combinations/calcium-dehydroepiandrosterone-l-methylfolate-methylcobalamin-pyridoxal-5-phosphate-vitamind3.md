## **Usage**

This combination of supplements is primarily used to manage post-menopausal osteoporosis and nutritional deficiencies, particularly those related to bone health and calcium levels. It supports bone health, helps manage low calcium levels, and may contribute to overall well-being.  It is considered a dietary supplement, not a drug, and therefore lacks a formal pharmacological classification.

The individual components work synergistically to address various aspects of bone health and metabolism.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination does not have a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN). Some brand names include Femboneo and Delpocal-DH. Regional variations may exist.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Calcium:** Strengthens bones by increasing bone mineral density.
* **Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA):**  A hormone that may influence other hormones and is thought to have a role in slowing the aging process; may contribute to bone mineral density.
* **L-Methylfolate:** The active form of folic acid, essential for cell division and growth, including red blood cell production.
* **Methylcobalamin:** The active form of vitamin B12, vital for nerve function, red blood cell production, and DNA synthesis.
* **Pyridoxal-5-phosphate:** The active form of vitamin B6, a cofactor in numerous metabolic processes, including protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism.
* **Vitamin D3:**  Facilitates calcium absorption in the gut and supports bone mineralization.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The absorption, metabolism, and elimination of each component vary:

* **Calcium:** Primarily absorbed in the small intestine, influenced by vitamin D. Excreted through urine and feces.
* **DHEA:**  Metabolized in the liver and other tissues. Excreted in urine.
* **L-Methylfolate, Methylcobalamin, and Pyridoxal-5-phosphate:** Absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract.  Excreted primarily through urine.
* **Vitamin D3:** Absorbed in the gut and metabolized in the liver and kidneys to its active form.

The mechanism of action for this combination involves supporting bone health, promoting calcium absorption, and contributing to essential metabolic processes.  Specific receptor binding or enzyme inhibition details for the combination as a whole are not readily available.

## **Dosage**

Because this is a combination of dietary supplements, standardized dosing guidelines do not exist. The dosage and administration recommendations can vary depending on the specific product and the individual patient's needs. A healthcare professional should determine the appropriate dosage based on the patient's age, health condition, and response to the supplement.

### **Standard Dosage**

Not established for this combination. Refer to individual component guidelines and consult with a healthcare professional.

#### **Adults:**

Dosage varies by product and individual patient needs.  Typically, one tablet daily is recommended for some products, but this can vary.

#### **Children:**

Not generally recommended for children unless specifically directed by a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**

Dosage adjustments in elderly patients, those with renal or hepatic impairment, or with comorbid conditions should be determined by a healthcare professional.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of this specific combination is not generally indicated in acute medical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or intensive care. Its primary use is in long-term support of bone health and nutritional balance.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments should be individualized based on the patient's specific health status, age, and comorbidities. A healthcare professional should guide these adjustments.

## **Side Effects**

Side effects are usually minimal and depend on the individual components. Some possibilities include:

### **Common Side Effects**

Gastrointestinal discomfort (constipation, nausea) is possible, particularly with calcium supplements.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions are possible.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Generally well-tolerated when taken as directed.  Long-term high doses of certain vitamins or minerals may have adverse effects.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

ADRs are uncommon but possible.

## **Contraindications**

Contraindications would primarily be related to individual component sensitivities or specific medical conditions that may be exacerbated by any of the components.

## **Drug Interactions**

Potential interactions can exist with certain medications due to the individual components. Consult a healthcare professional for specific guidance based on concomitant medications.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult a doctor before use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  The safety profile for this combination is not well-established.

## **Drug Profile Summary**
