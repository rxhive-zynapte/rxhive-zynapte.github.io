## **Usage**

This combination is prescribed for preventing or treating nutritional deficiencies in vitamin D, calcium, folic acid, B6, and B12. It's specifically beneficial for conditions like:

* **Osteoporosis/Osteomalacia**: Calcium and vitamin D are essential for bone health.
* **Megaloblastic Anemia**: Folic acid and B12 are crucial for red blood cell formation.
* **Peripheral Neuropathy**:  B vitamins, especially B12 and B6, are vital for nerve function. 
* **During Pregnancy**: Folic acid is important for preventing neural tube defects.

**Pharmacological Classification**: This combination is classified as a nutritional supplement and vitamin combination product.

**Mechanism of Action**: This combination works by supplementing the body with essential nutrients needed for various physiological processes: calcium and vitamin D for bone health, folic acid and B12 for cell division and nerve function, and B6 for metabolism.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no officially recognized alternate names. However, the components may be referred to by their chemical names:

* **Calcium Citrate/Calcium Carbonate**: Common calcium salts used in the combination.
* **Cholecalciferol**: Another name for Vitamin D3
* **Pyridoxine**: Another name for Vitamin B6
* **Cyanocobalamin/Methylcobalamin**: Alternate forms and names of Vitamin B12.
* **Folate**: Another name for Folic Acid

Brand names vary widely depending on the manufacturer.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics**:

* **Calcium**: Strengthens bones, aids muscle contraction, and nerve transmission.
* **Vitamin D3**: Facilitates calcium absorption, maintains serum calcium and phosphorus levels, and promotes bone mineralization.
* **Folic Acid**: Supports DNA synthesis, cell division, and red blood cell formation, preventing neural tube defects.
* **Methylcobalamin**: Maintains nerve function, aids red blood cell production, and DNA synthesis.
* **Vitamin B6**: Essential for protein metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and red blood cell formation.


**Pharmacokinetics**:

* **Absorption**: Primarily absorbed in the small intestine. Vitamin D absorption is enhanced by dietary fat. Calcium absorption is aided by vitamin D. B vitamins are generally well absorbed.
* **Metabolism**: Vitamin D undergoes hydroxylation in the liver and kidneys to its active form, calcitriol. B vitamins are metabolized in the liver.
* **Elimination**: Calcium is excreted primarily in urine and feces. Vitamin D metabolites are excreted in bile and urine. B vitamins are primarily excreted in urine.

**Mode of Action (Cellular/Molecular level)**:

* **Calcium**: Influences various cellular processes through calcium channels, signaling pathways, and intracellular calcium binding proteins.
* **Vitamin D3**: Binds to the vitamin D receptor, regulating gene expression involved in calcium and phosphorus metabolism.
* **Folic Acid**: Converted to tetrahydrofolic acid, a coenzyme for various metabolic reactions, including DNA synthesis.
* **Methylcobalamin**: Acts as a coenzyme for enzymes involved in DNA synthesis and nerve function.
* **Vitamin B6**: Acts as a coenzyme in various enzymatic reactions related to protein metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and red blood cell formation.


## **Dosage**

Dosage recommendations are based on clinical experience and patient needs, as official guidelines are not specifically established for this combination product. Individual components' requirements should be considered.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults**: Dosages will depend on individual needs and deficiencies. It's important to avoid excessive intake.

#### **Children**: Not generally recommended unless prescribed by a physician. Dosages are based on age, weight, and deficiency levels.


#### **Special Cases**:

## **Drug Interactions**

* Antacids may decrease calcium and iron absorption.
* Certain antibiotics (e.g., tetracyclines, quinolones) may reduce calcium absorption.
* Anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin) can interfere with vitamin D metabolism.
* Medications affecting vitamin D (e.g., orlistat) may reduce calcium absorption.
* Levodopa’s effectiveness may be reduced by vitamin B6.
* Cholestyramine may decrease the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin D.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding at recommended doses. However, it's crucial to consult a physician for proper guidance and dosage adjustments. Excessive vitamin D intake during pregnancy should be avoided.



## **Drug Profile Summary**
