## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.  It is also used in other conditions characterized by low bone mineral density and increased risk of fractures, such as those induced by glucocorticoid therapy. Additionally, ibandronic acid can be used to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy.  This drug's pharmacological classifications include:

* **Bisphosphonate:**  Ibandronic acid belongs to this class, known for inhibiting bone resorption.
* **Calcium Supplement:** Calcium carbonate provides this essential mineral for bone health.
* **Vitamin Supplement:**  Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) aids in calcium absorption and bone mineralization.

**Mechanism of Action:** Ibandronic acid inhibits osteoclast activity, reducing bone resorption. Calcium and vitamin D3 work synergistically to maintain bone density and strength.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Calcium + Ibandronic Acid + Vitamin D3" accurately represents the combination, it doesn't have a distinct international nonproprietary name (INN) like the individual components.

**Brand Names:**  Brand names vary regionally. Some examples include:

* **Becoral Kit**
* **Bondrova Pro**
* **Cora Kit**
* **Coralcal-Kit**
* **Idrofos Kit**
* **Kalcoral Kit**
* **MarinCal Kit**
* **Reefcal Kit**
* **FABRICAL IBD3 KIT**


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ibandronic acid, a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, binds to hydroxyapatite in bone, particularly in areas of active bone resorption.  It inhibits osteoclast activity, reducing bone breakdown.  Calcium is essential for bone structure, nerve function, and muscle contraction. Vitamin D3 promotes calcium absorption in the gut and maintains serum calcium levels necessary for bone mineralization.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Ibandronic acid has limited oral bioavailability, improved by administration on an empty stomach with plain water.  Absorption is reduced by food, calcium supplements, and other multivalent cations. It is not extensively metabolized and is primarily renally excreted. Calcium absorption is enhanced by vitamin D3.  Vitamin D3 undergoes hepatic and renal metabolism.

**Mode of Action:** Ibandronic acid's binding to hydroxyapatite disrupts osteoclast function at the cellular level, leading to decreased bone resorption.  Calcium is integrated into the bone matrix, while vitamin D3 facilitates its absorption and utilization. Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation are not directly involved in the primary mechanism of this combination therapy.
