## **Usage**

- This combination is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of vitamin D and B12 deficiencies, and conditions associated with calcium deficiency, such as osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and hypoparathyroidism.  It is also used to treat conditions such as rickets in children.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Vitamin & Mineral Supplement
- **Mechanism of Action:** Calcium is essential for bone health, nerve function, and muscle contraction. Vitamin D3 promotes calcium absorption in the gut and maintains adequate serum calcium and phosphate concentrations to enable normal mineralization of bone and to prevent hypocalcemic tetany. It is also needed for bone growth and bone remodeling by osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Methylcobalamin (vitamin B12) is crucial for nerve function, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell formation.

## **Alternate Names**

- No internationally recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination.
- The name may vary based on the specific salt of calcium used (e.g., calcium carbonate, calcium citrate).
- Several brand names market this combination; however, disclosing specific brand names is beyond my capability.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Calcium strengthens bones and teeth, supports nerve and muscle function. Vitamin D3 enhances calcium absorption, regulates bone metabolism. Methylcobalamin supports nerve function and red blood cell production.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Calcium absorption is influenced by vitamin D3 and dietary factors. Methylcobalamin is absorbed in the ileum. Vitamin D is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
    - **Metabolism:** Vitamin D3 is metabolized in the liver and kidneys to its active form, calcitriol. Methylcobalamin is converted to its active coenzyme forms. 
    - **Elimination:** Calcium is primarily excreted in urine and feces. Vitamin D and its metabolites are excreted primarily in the bile. Methylcobalamin is primarily eliminated through renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** Vitamin D3 binds to vitamin D receptors, modulating gene expression related to calcium and bone metabolism. Methylcobalamin acts as a coenzyme for various metabolic processes.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Dosage varies depending on the individual's needs and the specific formulation of the combination.  A common dosage is 1000-1200 mg of elemental calcium and 400-800 IU of Vitamin D3 daily, taken in divided doses for optimal absorption. Methylcobalamin doses can range from 1500-5000 mcg per day. 
- It's essential to consult the specific product information for precise guidance.

#### **Children:**

- Pediatric dosing is determined by age, weight, and deficiency severity.
- Safety considerations include monitoring calcium levels to prevent hypercalcemia.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** May require higher doses of vitamin D3 due to reduced skin synthesis and absorption.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be needed based on kidney function. Careful calcium and phosphorus monitoring are crucial.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Close monitoring is advised, although specific dose adjustments are not routinely recommended in mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments might be necessary for certain conditions, such as malabsorption syndromes.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- This particular combination is not typically used in acute clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or emergency situations. It is primarily used for the long-term management of deficiencies and chronic conditions.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjust dosages based on patient-specific factors and monitor calcium, phosphorus, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.
