## **Usage**

This combination therapy is primarily prescribed for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, especially in postmenopausal women.  It is also used to treat glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and Paget's disease of bone. Risedronate is classified as a bisphosphonate. Vitamin D3 and Calcium are essential nutrients involved in building and maintaining bone health.  Risedronate works by inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, thus reducing bone turnover and increasing bone mineral density. Calcium and vitamin D3 are crucial for calcium absorption and bone mineralization, working synergistically with risedronate to enhance bone health.


## **Alternate Names**

While "Calcium + Risedronate + Vitamin D3" accurately describes the combination, there may be other names based on different salt forms, like risedronate sodium and calcium carbonate.
Brand names for risedronate include Actonel and Atelvia. This combination is often marketed under brand names combining risedronate with calcium, such as Actonel with Calcium. Because calcium and vitamin D3 are commonly available as separate supplements, this particular combination may not have a unique international nonproprietary name (INN).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Risedronate, a bisphosphonate, acts primarily on bone. It binds to hydroxyapatite crystals in bone, inhibiting osteoclast activity and reducing bone resorption. This leads to an overall increase in bone mineral density. Calcium, vital for various physiological processes, plays a critical role in bone formation, muscle function, and nerve transmission. Vitamin D3 facilitates the absorption of calcium from the intestine and regulates calcium homeostasis.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Risedronate exhibits poor oral bioavailability (about 0.6%), but this is improved when taken on an empty stomach. It is not extensively metabolized and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. The calcium component is absorbed in the gut, with absorption influenced by factors like vitamin D levels. Calcium is eliminated through the faeces, urine and sweat. Vitamin D is metabolized in the liver and kidneys, and is primarily excreted in the feces.

**Mode of Action:** Risedronate's binding to hydroxyapatite in bone inhibits osteoclast function by disrupting the mevalonate pathway, leading to decreased geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthesis. It also reduces the number of osteoclast progenitors. Calcium is absorbed into the bloodstream and plays an essential role in bone mineralization and other physiological processes. Vitamin D3 promotes intestinal calcium absorption and regulates calcium and phosphate balance.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

For osteoporosis treatment and prevention, risedronate is typically administered as 35 mg orally once a week, taken on the same day each week. For glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, 5 mg orally once daily is usually prescribed.   The calcium supplement (commonly calcium carbonate) is usually taken with meals throughout the day.  A total of 1200-1500 mg of elemental calcium and 400-800 IU of vitamin D3 from all sources (diet and supplements) is generally recommended. The optimal duration of bisphosphonate treatment for osteoporosis has not been established.

#### **Children:**

Risedronate use is generally not recommended for children. Calcium and vitamin D3 requirements vary with age.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is necessary for risedronate in elderly patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance â‰¥ 30 mL/min).  Calcium and vitamin D3 requirements may be higher in the elderly due to decreased absorption.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is necessary for risedronate in mild to moderate renal impairment. Risedronate is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min). Calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation should be monitored closely, and dose adjustments may be needed.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific dosage adjustment is usually necessary for risedronate, as it is not significantly metabolized by the liver. Monitor patients closely. Calcium and Vitamin D dosing adjustments are not typically necessary. However, cautious monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Dosage adjustments may be required depending on the specific comorbid conditions. Patients with hypocalcemia should have their calcium levels corrected before starting risedronate therapy.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of calcium, risedronate, and vitamin D3 isn't typically employed in emergency or acute care settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU management. Its role is primarily in chronic disease management and prevention.




### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are mainly considered for renal impairment. Monitor patients for potential side effects and adjust the dosage of calcium and vitamin D3 accordingly.  Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism may warrant individualized dosing strategies.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

* Gastrointestinal:  Upset stomach, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, abdominal pain
* Musculoskeletal:  Bone, joint, or muscle pain

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Esophageal problems: Difficulty or pain when swallowing, heartburn, irritation or ulcers in the esophagus
* Osteonecrosis of the jaw: Severe jaw pain, swelling, numbness, loose teeth, or delayed healing after dental work
* Atypical femoral fractures:  Unusual thigh or groin pain

### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential long-term effects with risedronate include osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fractures, particularly with extended use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs include severe hypocalcemia, esophageal ulceration or perforation, osteonecrosis of the jaw, and atypical femoral fractures.



## **Contraindications**

## **Drug Interactions**

* Calcium, antacids, and other multivalent cations:  Can decrease the absorption of risedronate. These medications should be taken at a different time of day than risedronate.
* Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Concurrent use may increase the risk of gastrointestinal irritation.
* Aspirin



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Risedronate is generally avoided during pregnancy due to potential risks to the developing fetus.  It is unknown if risedronate is excreted in human breast milk. Caution is advised when using risedronate during breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
