## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Calcium + Vitamin D3 is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of hypocalcemia, vitamin D deficiency, rickets in children, osteomalacia in adults, and osteoporosis. It's also used as an adjunct therapy in patients with established osteoporosis receiving specific treatments like bisphosphonates.  Patients with inadequate calcium intake (<700mg per day) or confirmed hypocalcemia should be advised on dietary measures for correction.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Vitamin and mineral supplement, calcium supplement, vitamin D supplement.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Calcium is essential for bone mineralization, nerve conduction, muscle contraction, and various enzymatic reactions. Vitamin D3 facilitates calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis.

## **Alternate Names**

- Calcium carbonate + Cholecalciferol
- Calcium citrate + Cholecalciferol
- Several Brand names are available, such as Caltrate, Os-Cal, Oysco, Citracal, Calcichew-D3, AdCal D3.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Calcium strengthens bones and supports neuromuscular function. Vitamin D3 modulates calcium and phosphate absorption, bone metabolism, and immune function.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Calcium absorption is enhanced by vitamin D3 and occurs primarily in the duodenum and proximal jejunum. The absorption of calcium citrate doesn't depend on stomach acid.
    - **Metabolism:** Vitamin D3 is converted to its active form, calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3), in the liver and kidneys.
    - **Elimination:** Calcium is excreted mainly through the kidneys and feces. Vitamin D metabolites are excreted primarily in bile.
- **Mode of Action:** Vitamin D3 binds to the vitamin D receptor, a nuclear receptor, modulating gene transcription related to calcium and phosphate transport and metabolism.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Prevention: 1000 mg calcium and 400-800 IU vitamin D3 daily for ages 19-50, or 10 mcg of vitamin D3 combined with at least 1000 mg of calcium daily.
- Treatment of Deficiency: Dosages vary depending on the severity of the deficiency. Commonly, 1000-1300 mg of elemental calcium and 400-800 IU of vitamin D3 are prescribed.  Higher doses of vitamin D3 may be needed to achieve target serum 25(OH)D concentrations.
- Over 50 Years of Age: 1200 mg calcium and 800-1000 IU vitamin D3 daily.
- Post-Thyroidectomy: 3g of calcium/day for 2 weeks is standard.
- Split doses, about 4 hours apart.



#### **Children:**

- Dosages are based on age and health condition and should be determined by a pediatrician. Starting at age one, the RDA is 700 mg/day.
- Pediatric Safety Considerations: Monitor calcium levels to prevent hypercalcemia.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Ensure adequate vitamin D intake (800-1000 IU) due to decreased skin synthesis and potential malabsorption. Patients &gt;70 years of age: Calcium 1300 mg/day.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Monitor serum calcium and phosphorus levels.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Monitor vitamin D levels and adjust dose as needed. Calcidiol is available for patients with liver disease if hydroxylation is impaired.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized dosing is based on underlying health conditions.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use: Dosages are adjusted based on patient-specific factors and monitored regularly.  Doses of up to 540,000 IU have been studied.
- Emergency Situations: IV calcium gluconate is administered for severe hypocalcemia with tetany or seizures, followed by oral supplementation.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Constipation
- Bloating
- Gas
- Nausea, abdominal pain


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

## **Contraindications**

- Hypercalcemia
- Hypercalciuria
- Hypophosphatemia

- Thiazide diuretics (increased risk of hypercalcemia)
- Cardiac glycosides (effect potentiated by hypercalcemia)
- Erlotinib (reduced efficacy)
- Paricalcitol (increased risk of hypercalcemia)
- Enzyme-inducing antiepileptics (increased vitamin D metabolism)
- Aluminum products (risk of fatal encephalopathy in patients with renal failure)
- Iron or thyroid hormone supplements (take at different times of day than calcium)


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding at recommended doses (1000 mg calcium and 600 IU vitamin D3).
- Breastfed infants should receive 400 IU vitamin D daily.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Calcium is crucial for bone health and neuromuscular function. Vitamin D enhances calcium absorption.
- **Side Effects:** Constipation, bloating, hypercalcemia.
- **Contraindications:** Hypercalcemia, hypervitaminosis D, severe renal impairment.
- **Drug Interactions:** Several drug interactions, including tetracyclines, corticosteroids, and thiazide diuretics.

- **Dosage:**  Adult doses are outlined in the "Dosage" section.  
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Serum calcium, phosphorus, 25(OH)D, PTH, creatinine.


## **Popular Combinations**

- Calcium + Vitamin D3 is often combined in a single formulation for convenience and efficacy.


## **Precautions**
    - Screen patients for allergies, metabolic disorders, and organ dysfunction.

    - **Specific Populations:**
        - **Pregnant Women:** Monitor calcium levels; avoid excessive doses.
        - **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Ensure infant vitamin D supplementation.
        - **Children & Elderly:** Adjust doses as appropriate.
