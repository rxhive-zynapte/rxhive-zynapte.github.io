## **Usage**

- This combination is primarily prescribed for the prevention and treatment of calcium and vitamin D3 deficiencies. It is particularly beneficial for individuals at risk of deficiencies, such as the elderly, those with limited sun exposure, and individuals with malabsorption syndromes.  Zinc, while not routinely included in all formulations, may be added to support bone health. This combination may also be used adjunctively in osteoporosis treatment and for specific conditions like osteomalacia.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  This is a combination of minerals and vitamins and therefore classified as a nutritional supplement and bone health agent. It is not a single drug belonging to a singular pharmacological class like antibiotics or analgesics.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Calcium is essential for bone mineralization, nerve function, and muscle contraction. Vitamin D3 facilitates calcium absorption from the intestine and regulates calcium homeostasis. Zinc contributes to bone formation and mineralization.

## **Alternate Names**

- There isn't one single international non-proprietary name (INN) for this specific combination. However, individual components have their INNs: Calcium Carbonate, Colecalciferol (Vitamin D3), and Zinc Sulfate (or other zinc salts).
- **Brand Names:** Numerous brand names exist worldwide for combinations of calcium, vitamin D3, and zinc. A few examples (note this isn't exhaustive) include Calciumade, Caltrate, Os-Cal, Oysco, Citracal, Adcal D3, and Calcichew-D3. Many more brand names exist, often specific to regions or countries.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Calcium is incorporated into the bone matrix, contributing to skeletal strength and integrity. Vitamin D3 promotes intestinal calcium absorption and regulates bone remodeling. Zinc plays a role in bone formation and mineralization.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Calcium carbonate absorption occurs primarily in the duodenum and is enhanced by the presence of vitamin D3. Vitamin D3 is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract in the presence of bile. Zinc absorption occurs in the small intestine.
    - **Metabolism:**  Vitamin D3 undergoes hepatic hydroxylation to form 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], followed by renal hydroxylation to form the active metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D]. Calcium itself isn't metabolized, but its serum level is tightly regulated. Zinc is incorporated into metalloenzymes and other proteins.
    - **Elimination:** Calcium is excreted primarily through the kidneys and feces. Vitamin D metabolites are excreted in bile and feces. Zinc is excreted mainly in feces.
- **Mode of Action (Cellular/Molecular):**  1,25(OH)2D binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the intestine, promoting calcium absorption.  VDR also plays a role in bone cell differentiation and function. Zinc is involved in enzymatic activity crucial for bone formation and mineralization.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Vitamin D primarily works through VDR. It doesn't directly inhibit enzymes or modulate neurotransmitters in the way some drugs do.


## **Dosage**

Dosage guidelines are general recommendations and can vary based on individual patient needs and specific product formulations. Always consult the specific product information.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The recommended daily allowance varies depending on age and other factors. A typical adult dose could range from 500-1500 mg of calcium carbonate and 400-800 IU of vitamin D3. The zinc component, when present, usually ranges from 5-15 mg. Dosing may be once or twice daily.

#### **Children:**

- Dosage in children should be individualized based on age, weight, and calcium/vitamin D status.  Always consult pediatric guidelines and product information, as some formulations are not suitable for children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  May require higher doses of vitamin D3 due to reduced skin synthesis and intestinal absorption.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Close monitoring of calcium and vitamin D levels is required. Dosage adjustments may be necessary. In severe renal impairment, use cautiously.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Individualized dosing is required depending on coexisting conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- The combination is not typically indicated for acute medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its role is primarily in chronic deficiency prevention and management and supporting bone health in chronic conditions.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose modifications are made on a case-by-case basis considering renal function, hepatic function, other medical conditions, and drug interactions.
