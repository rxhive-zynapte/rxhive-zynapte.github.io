## **Usage**

This combination of calcium chloride, citric acid, and sodium chloride is primarily used in **regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA)** during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).  It is not typically prescribed as a medication for other conditions outside of this specific context.  It falls under the pharmacological classifications of **anticoagulant** and **electrolyte replenisher**.

The mechanism of action involves citrate chelating ionized calcium in the blood, thereby interrupting the coagulation cascade and preventing clotting within the CRRT circuit. The sodium chloride helps maintain osmotic balance and electrolyte levels, while the citric acid component contributes to the overall buffering of the solution.


## **Alternate Names**

This combination does not have a specific generic name, as it is formulated specifically for RCA in CRRT settings.  It may be referred to as "citrate anticoagulant solution" or "RCA solution".  There are no widely recognized brand names for this specific mixture, though proprietary solutions used for CRRT with RCA may incorporate these components.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Citrate binds to ionized calcium, rendering it unavailable for the coagulation cascade. This prevents clot formation within the CRRT circuit.  Sodium chloride maintains isotonicity and provides electrolytes.  Citric acid buffers the solution, contributing to acid-base balance.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Citrate is metabolized by the liver to bicarbonate. Calcium is filtered out during CRRT, necessitating supplementation. Sodium and chloride are routinely monitored and adjusted during CRRT.

**Mode of Action:** Citrate acts by chelating ionized calcium.  This chelation directly inhibits the calcium-dependent steps of the coagulation cascade.

**Elimination Pathways:** Citrate is primarily metabolized in the liver. Calcium is removed by the CRRT circuit.  Sodium and chloride are primarily eliminated renally, but removal is affected by the CRRT parameters.


## **Dosage**

Dosage for this combination is specific to the CRRT protocol and patient parameters.  There is no standard dosage regimen outside of CRRT.

### **Standard Dosage**

Standard dosing is individualized and based on the patient's CRRT prescription and their calcium, electrolyte, and acid-base status. Dosage is adjusted based on frequent monitoring of blood ionized calcium, total calcium, bicarbonate, pH, other electrolytes and acidâ€“base parameters.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is used in CRRT during:

- **Intubation:** Not usually required.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Not usually required.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not usually required.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  Specifically during CRRT.
- **Emergency Situations:**  Not usually indicated.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Metabolic alkalosis
- Hypocalcemia
- Electrolyte imbalances (hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia)


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Citrate accumulation (in patients with liver failure or impaired metabolism) leading to severe hypocalcemia and metabolic acidosis.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe hypocalcemia leading to tetany, seizures, or cardiac arrhythmias.


## **Contraindications**

- Liver failure (relative contraindication, requires careful monitoring).
- Severe shock (relative contraindication, due to impaired citrate metabolism).
- Hypersensitivity to any component (rare).


## **Drug Interactions**

- Calcium supplements: May decrease anticoagulant effect of citrate.
- Medications containing calcium: May counteract the anticoagulant effect of citrate.
