## **Usage**

This combination drug is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of nutritional deficiencies, particularly those involving calcium, folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and vitamin D3. It is commonly used to address conditions such as osteoporosis, osteomalacia, rickets, and during pregnancy to prevent neural tube defects.  It is also used to manage hypocalcemia resulting from various underlying medical conditions.

- **Pharmacological classification:** Nutritional supplement.

- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination provides essential nutrients to support various physiological processes. Calcium is crucial for bone health, nerve function, and muscle contraction. Vitamin D3 facilitates calcium absorption and bone mineralization. Folic acid supports cell division and growth, particularly during pregnancy, preventing neural tube defects. Methylcobalamin (vitamin B12) and pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6) are involved in nerve function, red blood cell formation, and various metabolic processes.


## **Alternate Names**

While there isn't a universally recognized alternate name, this combination may be referred to by variations such as "Calcium + Vitamin D3 + Folic Acid + B Vitamins" or similar descriptions.  Brand names can vary widely depending on the manufacturer and region.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Calcium citrate is absorbed in the gut and elevates serum calcium levels. Vitamin D3, after conversion to its active form calcitriol, promotes calcium absorption in the intestine and regulates calcium homeostasis. Folic acid is converted to its active form tetrahydrofolic acid, essential for DNA synthesis and cell division. Methylcobalamin is a coenzyme in various metabolic pathways, including myelin synthesis and DNA replication. Pyridoxine hydrochloride plays a role in neurotransmitter synthesis and red blood cell production.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Calcium citrate is absorbed in the small intestine, influenced by vitamin D3.  Vitamin D3 undergoes hepatic and renal metabolism to calcitriol.  Folic acid is absorbed primarily in the jejunum. Methylcobalamin is absorbed via intrinsic factor-mediated transport in the ileum. Pyridoxine is readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Elimination pathways vary for each component but mainly involve renal and hepatic routes.


## **Dosage**

Dosage guidelines for this combination are not standardized and are typically determined based on individual patient needs and underlying conditions.  Always consult product-specific information and clinical guidelines.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Dosage is individualized.  Typical regimens may involve daily intake of calcium ranging from 1000 mg to 1500 mg, vitamin D3 from 400 IU to 1000 IU, folic acid from 400 mcg to 800 mcg, methylcobalamin and pyridoxine as clinically indicated.

#### **Children:**

Pediatric dosage should be determined by a pediatrician or a healthcare professional, and it varies with age and clinical needs.

#### **Special Cases:**

Dosage adjustments may be needed in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  Consult clinical guidelines for appropriate adjustments.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific clinical settings like ICU or emergency situations should be guided by patient-specific factors and clinical judgment.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage should be adjusted according to clinical response and patient factors like renal or hepatic function.

## **Side Effects**
