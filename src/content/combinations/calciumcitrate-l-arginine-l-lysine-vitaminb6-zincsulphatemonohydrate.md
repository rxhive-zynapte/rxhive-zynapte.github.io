## **Alternate Names**

There is no officially recognized generic name for this specific combination. Individually, the components may be referred to as:

* **Calcium Citrate:** Tricalcium dicitrate
* **L-Arginine:** (S)-2-Amino-5-guanidinopentanoic acid
* **L-Lysine:** (S)-2,6-Diaminohexanoic acid

## **How It Works**

This combination product works through the synergistic actions of its individual components:

* **Calcium citrate:** Provides calcium, which is essential for bone formation, muscle function, nerve transmission, and blood clotting. It is absorbed in the intestines and excreted primarily through the kidneys.
* **L-Arginine:**  A semi-essential amino acid involved in protein synthesis and various metabolic processes. It acts as a precursor for nitric oxide, which promotes vasodilation and improves blood flow.  It is metabolized primarily in the liver.
* **L-Lysine:** An essential amino acid necessary for protein synthesis, collagen formation, and calcium absorption. It plays a role in immune function and hormone production. Metabolism occurs primarily in the liver.
* **Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine):** A water-soluble vitamin crucial for various metabolic processes, including amino acid metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and red blood cell formation. It is absorbed in the small intestine and excreted by the kidneys.
* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:** Provides zinc, which is essential for immune function, cell growth and division, wound healing, and protein synthesis. Zinc absorption occurs primarily in the small intestine, and excretion is mainly through the feces.
