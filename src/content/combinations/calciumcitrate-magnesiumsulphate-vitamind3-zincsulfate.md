## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the prevention and treatment of deficiencies in calcium, magnesium, vitamin D3, and zinc. It supports bone health, muscle function, nerve function, and immune system function.  It may also be used in conditions like osteoporosis, osteomalacia, hypoparathyroidism, and during pregnancy and lactation when increased demand for these nutrients exists.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**  This combination drug falls under several classifications, including:
    - Calcium Supplement
    - Magnesium Supplement
    - Vitamin Supplement
    - Mineral Supplement

- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination provides the body with essential nutrients that play vital roles in various physiological processes:
    - **Calcium:** Essential for bone formation, muscle contraction, nerve transmission, and blood clotting.
    - **Magnesium:**  Involved in bone formation,  enzyme function, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, and blood pressure regulation.
    - **Vitamin D3:** Regulates calcium and phosphorus absorption, crucial for bone health, immune function, and cell growth.
    - **Zinc:** Supports immune function, cell growth and division, wound healing, and the senses of taste and smell.


## **Alternate Names**

There isn't one single international non-proprietary name (INN) for this combination. The individual components have their established INNs (calcium citrate, magnesium sulfate, cholecalciferol/vitamin D3, zinc sulfate).  This combination may be referred to generically as a calcium-magnesium-zinc-vitamin D supplement.

- **Brand Names:** Several brand names exist, including (but not limited to) Fractocal-D3 and Calvimac. Brand names vary by region and manufacturer.



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**
    - Calcium strengthens bones and teeth, enables muscle contraction, and supports nerve function.
    - Magnesium supports bone health, muscle and nerve function, energy production, and enzyme activity.
    - Vitamin D3 facilitates calcium and phosphorus absorption, optimizing bone mineralization.
    - Zinc promotes immune function, wound healing, and cell growth.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Calcium Citrate:**  Absorbed in the small intestine, facilitated by vitamin D. Excreted primarily through the kidneys.
    - **Magnesium Sulfate:** Absorbed in the small intestine. Excreted mainly by the kidneys.
    - **Vitamin D3:** Absorbed in the small intestine. Stored in the liver and fat tissues. Metabolized in the liver and kidneys.
    - **Zinc Sulfate:** Absorbed in the small intestine.  Excreted primarily in the feces.

- **Mode of Action (at cellular/molecular level):**
    - Calcium influences cellular signaling pathways, muscle contraction through interaction with troponin-C, and neurotransmitter release.
    - Magnesium acts as a cofactor for numerous enzymes, influences ion channels, and modulates neuronal activity.
    - Vitamin D3 binds to vitamin D receptors (VDRs) in target cells, modulating gene expression related to calcium and phosphorus homeostasis.
    - Zinc acts as a structural component of many enzymes and proteins, influencing gene expression and various cellular processes.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D metabolites. Zinc is eliminated primarily through feces.
