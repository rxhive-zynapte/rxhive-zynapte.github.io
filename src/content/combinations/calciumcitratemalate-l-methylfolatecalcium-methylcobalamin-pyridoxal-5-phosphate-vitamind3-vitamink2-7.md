## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the prevention and treatment of conditions related to deficiencies in the listed vitamins and minerals, particularly in bone health and certain metabolic processes. It is often used in individuals at risk for or diagnosed with osteoporosis, osteopenia, and vitamin deficiencies (especially during pregnancy).  It may also be prescribed to support overall bone health, particularly in postmenopausal women or individuals with increased fracture risk.  Additionally, it may be used to address deficiencies arising from malabsorption syndromes or dietary restrictions.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This combination product falls under multiple classifications, including vitamin supplement, mineral supplement, bone health agent, and hematopoietic agent (due to the inclusion of B vitamins and folate which are essential for red blood cell formation).

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination medication works by providing the necessary nutrients for maintaining and improving bone health, supporting nerve function, and contributing to red blood cell formation.


## **Alternate Names** 

There is no one single official alternate name for this combination.  It is typically referred to by the names of its components. The specific components or ratios may vary in different formulations. Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer. Some examples include Caltuf and Calshang K27.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Calcium Citrate Malate:**  Provides calcium, essential for bone mineralization, muscle contraction, nerve transmission, and blood clotting. Citrate malate improves calcium absorption.
* **L-Methyl Folate Calcium:** The biologically active form of folate, vital for DNA synthesis, cell division, and red blood cell formation. It also plays a role in bone health.
* **Methylcobalamin:**  A form of vitamin B12, crucial for nerve function, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell formation.
* **Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate:** The active form of vitamin B6, important for various metabolic processes, including protein metabolism and nerve function.  It's also involved in collagen synthesis, which supports bone health.
* **Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol):**  Enhances calcium absorption in the gut and maintains calcium and phosphate homeostasis, critical for bone mineralization.
* **Vitamin K2-7 (Menaquinone-7):**  Plays a crucial role in bone metabolism by activating osteocalcin, a protein that binds calcium to bone matrix, thereby promoting bone mineralization and preventing calcium deposition in soft tissues.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Absorption of calcium citrate malate is enhanced by the citrate component. L-methyl folate is readily absorbed. Vitamin B12 absorption requires intrinsic factor in the stomach. Pyridoxal-5-phosphate, Vitamin D3, and Vitamin K2 are absorbed with fats in the diet.
* **Metabolism:**  Vitamins B6 and K are metabolized in the liver. Vitamin D3 is hydroxylated in the liver and kidneys to its active form, calcitriol.
* **Elimination:** Calcium is primarily excreted in urine and feces.  Excess B vitamins are excreted in urine. Vitamin K is primarily excreted in bile and feces. Vitamin D metabolites are excreted in bile and urine.
