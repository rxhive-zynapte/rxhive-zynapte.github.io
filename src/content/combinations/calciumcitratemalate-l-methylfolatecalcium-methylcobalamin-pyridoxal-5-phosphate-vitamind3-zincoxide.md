## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed to address deficiencies in calcium, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, vitamin D3, and zinc. It is commonly used to treat conditions like osteoporosis or osteopenia (where calcium and vitamin D3 play a crucial role), vitamin B12 deficiency (addressed by methylcobalamin), folate deficiency (where L-methyl folate is essential), vitamin B6 deficiency (pyridoxal-5-phosphate), and zinc deficiency (zinc oxide). It may also be used in patients at risk of these deficiencies like pregnant women, nursing mothers, and postmenopausal women. This combination can also be considered a nutritional supplement.

## **Alternate Names**

No specific alternate names exist for this combination as a whole. It is often marketed under various brand names (e.g. Alecium-XT).  However, the individual components are sometimes known by these names:

* **Calcium Citrate Malate:** Calcium malate, calcium citrate
* **L-Methyl Folate Calcium:** Metafolin, L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate calcium
* **Methylcobalamin:** Vitamin B12, cobalamin
* **Pyridoxal-5-phosphate:** P5P, Vitamin B6
* **Vitamin D3:** Cholecalciferol
* **Zinc Oxide:** Zinc

## **How It Works**

This combination product works by supplementing essential nutrients, each having a specific role:

* **Calcium and Vitamin D3:** Essential for bone mineralization; vitamin D3 aids calcium absorption.
* **B Vitamins (Methylcobalamin, L-methyl folate, Pyridoxal-5-phosphate):** Act as cofactors in numerous enzymatic reactions vital for DNA synthesis, red blood cell production, nerve function, and various metabolic processes.
* **Zinc Oxide:** Supports enzyme activity and immune function.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Absorption of calcium is enhanced by taking it with food, particularly foods rich in Vitamin D.  L-methyl folate is the active form of folate, offering superior bioavailability. Vitamin D3 aids the absorption of both calcium and phosphorus.  Methylcobalamin, a readily absorbed form of vitamin B12, aids nerve health. Vitamin B6, as Pyridoxal-5-phosphate, helps support various metabolic pathways.  Zinc, from Zinc Oxide, gets absorbed in the small intestine. Elimination pathways differ for each component: calcium is excreted primarily through the kidneys and feces; B vitamins are eliminated via renal excretion; and zinc mainly through feces.


## **Dosage**

Dosing is dependent on individual patient needs and deficiencies. A healthcare professional should determine the appropriate dosage.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Dosage varies depending on individual needs and the specific formulation. It's crucial to consult a healthcare professional for personalized dosing.

#### **Children:**  Pediatric dosing must be determined by a healthcare professional based on age, weight, and specific deficiency.

#### **Special Cases:** Dosage adjustments are necessary based on the individual's health status and should be decided in consultation with a physician.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific clinical situations (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, emergency situations) should be determined by the attending physician based on the patient's individual needs.  The combination itself is not typically indicated for acute management in these settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are essential for patients with renal/hepatic impairments, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism. A healthcare professional should individualize dosages in these cases.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Constipation, nausea, and stomach upset are possible with calcium supplementation.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Hypercalcemia (high calcium levels) can occur with excessive calcium intake. Allergic reactions to any component are also possible, though rare.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term excessive intake of certain vitamins or minerals could lead to adverse effects.  For instance, excessive zinc could interfere with copper absorption.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Significant ADRs are rare but can occur.  Seek medical attention if any adverse reaction occurs.



## **Contraindications**

This combination should be avoided in individuals with hypercalcemia, hypersensitivity to any component, or certain kidney conditions.

## **Drug Interactions**

Calcium can interact with certain medications, like bisphosphonates and some antibiotics.  Consult a healthcare professional about potential interactions with other medications.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

This combination is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding when taken as directed and for addressing identified deficiencies.  However, always consult a healthcare professional before use.

## **Drug Profile Summary**
