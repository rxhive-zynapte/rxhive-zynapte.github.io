## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily used to address deficiencies in calcium, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and vitamin D3. It's prescribed for conditions like osteoporosis, osteopenia, and various deficiency-related conditions. It also supports nerve function, red blood cell production, cell division and growth (especially during pregnancy), metabolic processes, and immune function.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Nutritional supplement, vitamin/mineral combination.

- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination delivers essential nutrients to the body. Calcium and vitamin D3 support bone health; B vitamins act as cofactors for enzymes; and zinc supports enzyme activity and immune function.


## **Alternate Names**

No specific alternate names exist for this combination. However, it's marketed under various brand names (e.g., Caltuf). Individual components may be known as: Calcium citrate malate (calcium malate, calcium citrate), L-methyl folate calcium (Metafolin, L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate calcium), Methylcobalamin (vitamin B12, cobalamin), Pyridoxal-5-phosphate (P5P, vitamin B6), Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Each component has specific effects: calcium and vitamin D3 promote bone mineralization; B vitamins are cofactors for various enzymes; zinc aids enzyme activity and immune function.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Absorption, metabolism, and elimination vary for each component. Calcium citrate malate is absorbed in the gut, vitamin D3 through the skin and gut, B vitamins in the small intestine. They are metabolized in the liver and excreted through urine and feces.

**Mode of Action:** Calcium and vitamin D3 contribute to bone formation. B vitamins participate in DNA synthesis, red blood cell formation, and nerve function. Zinc is essential for cell growth, immune function, and wound healing.
