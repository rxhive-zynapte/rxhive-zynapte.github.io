## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for:

* **Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI):** Improves blood flow and reduces symptoms like swelling, pain, and leg heaviness.
* **Hemorrhoids (Piles):** Reduces inflammation, pain, and bleeding.
* **Varicose Veins:** Improves venous tone and reduces their appearance.
* **Diabetic Retinopathy:** Improves microcirculation in the retina.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Vasoprotective agent, Venotonic, Phlebotonic.

**Mechanism of Action:** Calcium dobesilate stabilizes capillary walls, reduces capillary permeability and fragility, improves microcirculation, and decreases blood viscosity. Citrus bioflavonoids have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, enhancing the effects of vitamin C and supporting vascular health. Vitamin C is essential for collagen synthesis, strengthens blood vessel walls, and acts as an antioxidant.


## **Alternate Names**

* Venorich
* Dobelon
* Veinosil Forte
* Dobipile Plus (when combined with Troxerutin)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Calcium dobesilate improves microcirculation by decreasing capillary permeability and fragility, reducing blood viscosity, and acting as an antagonist to histamine, serotonin, and bradykinin. Citrus bioflavonoids and vitamin C exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, further supporting vascular health.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Calcium dobesilate is well-absorbed after oral administration.  It is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily through the kidneys. Citrus bioflavonoids are metabolized in the gut and liver. Vitamin C is readily absorbed and distributed throughout the body, with excess excreted in urine.  

**Mode of Action:** Calcium dobesilate acts on the vascular endothelium, reducing capillary permeability and improving microcirculation. Citrus bioflavonoids and vitamin C scavenge free radicals, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 500mg Calcium Dobesilate + 500mg Citrus Bioflavonoids + 100mg Vitamin C twice daily (BID) with meals.  Treatment duration varies depending on the condition and severity.

#### **Children:**  Safety and efficacy not established in children; use is generally not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal function; close monitoring is advised.
