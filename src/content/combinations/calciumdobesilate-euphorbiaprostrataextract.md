## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the treatment of hemorrhoids (piles), both internal and external, acute and chronic. It also addresses associated symptoms such as pain, inflammation, itching, swelling, and bleeding.  It is also indicated for anal fissures, anorectal inflammation and swelling, and post-surgical treatment following a haemorrhoidectomy. Additionally, it is used for problems related to veins and venous circulation like varicose veins and for chronic venous insufficiency.
- **Pharmacological Classification**: Vasoprotective, Venotonic, Anorectal preparation.
- **Mechanism of Action**: Calcium dobesilate enhances venous tone, reduces capillary permeability and fragility, and improves lymphatic drainage. Euphorbia prostrata extract, containing flavonoids, phenolic acids, and tannins, contributes anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, astringent, and wound-healing properties.  The combination synergistically reduces inflammation, controls bleeding, promotes healing, and strengthens vein walls.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for the combination itself. However, the individual components have other names:
    - Calcium Dobesilate: Doxium
    - Euphorbia Prostrata: No widely used alternate name
- **Brand Names**: Sitcom Forte, Thank OD Forte, Pilorute EP Forte

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Calcium dobesilate improves microcirculation by reducing capillary permeability, increasing venous tone, and enhancing lymphatic drainage. Euphorbia prostrata extract's flavonoids and tannins have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and hemostatic effects. Together, they decrease swelling, pain, and bleeding in the anorectal area.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Specific pharmacokinetic data for the combined formulation is limited.  Calcium dobesilate is absorbed orally. Information regarding the absorption, metabolism, and elimination of Euphorbia prostrata extract is scarce.  It can be administered orally and topically.

- **Mode of Action**: Flavonoids in Euphorbia prostrata inhibit inflammatory pathways and provide antioxidant effects. Tannins exert astringent and hemostatic effects, controlling bleeding. Calcium dobesilate works on the vascular system, improving venous tone and reducing capillary fragility. The combination addresses multiple aspects of hemorrhoid pathophysiology.

- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation**: Limited information is available on specific interactions at the receptor, enzyme, or neurotransmitter level. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise molecular mechanism.

- **Elimination Pathways**: Information regarding elimination pathways is limited in available resources.
