## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the treatment of hemorrhoids (piles) and other inflammatory anorectal conditions like anal fissures and proctitis. It's classified as a haemorrhoidal preparation, encompassing vasoprotective, anti-inflammatory, local anesthetic, and decongestant actions.  The medication works by shrinking swollen blood vessels, reducing inflammation, relieving pain and itching, and promoting healing in the affected area.

## **Alternate Names**

While no specific alternate names exist for this exact multi-component formulation, individual components have synonyms. Lidocaine is also known as Lignocaine. Several brand names market this combination, with formulations varying slightly in concentrations.  Some examples of brand names include Hemolit, Pilorute, and Ruticool.  Formulations are available as creams, ointments, and suppositories.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Calcium Dobesilate:**  A vasoprotective agent that strengthens capillary walls, reduces their permeability, and improves microcirculation. It decreases swelling and inflammation.
* **Hydrocortisone:** A corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory and antipruritic properties.  It reduces swelling, redness, and itching by suppressing the immune response and inhibiting inflammatory mediators.
* **Lidocaine:** A local anesthetic that blocks nerve signal transmission, reducing pain and itching. It acts by inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels on nerve cell membranes.
* **Phenylephrine:** A decongestant that constricts blood vessels, reducing swelling and congestion in the anorectal area.
* **Troxerutin:** A bioflavonoid and vasoprotective agent.  Like Calcium Dobesilate, it helps to strengthen blood vessels and reduce capillary permeability.
* **Zinc Oxide:**  Acts as a skin protectant, mild astringent, and antiseptic, soothing irritation and promoting healing.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily topical application with minimal systemic absorption. The extent of absorption for each ingredient varies depending on the formulation and application method. Hepatic metabolism is anticipated for the systemically absorbed fraction, with renal excretion of metabolites.  Specific pharmacokinetic data for this combined formulation are limited.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Apply a thin layer to the clean and dry affected area 2-3 times daily, or as directed by the physician.  Use the provided applicator for rectal insertion if using a suppository.


#### **Children:** Use in children below 12 years of age is generally not recommended unless specifically prescribed by a doctor.  Pediatric dosage adjustments are at the physician's discretion.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution due to potential for increased systemic absorption and drug interactions.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment may be needed in cases of severe renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Exercise caution due to the liver's role in drug metabolism.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advisable in patients with diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, or glaucoma.
