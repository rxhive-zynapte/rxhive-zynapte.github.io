## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for symptomatic relief of anorectal disorders, such as hemorrhoids (piles) and anal fissures. It may also offer relief for other anorectal conditions like proctitis and pruritus ani.  It combines agents with different mechanisms for comprehensive symptom management.

Its pharmacological classifications include:

* **Vasoprotective:** Calcium dobesilate
* **Corticosteroid:** Hydrocortisone
* **Local anesthetic:** Lidocaine
* **Decongestant:** Phenylephrine
* **Astringent/Antiseptic:** Zinc oxide

This combination reduces inflammation, relieves pain and itching, and promotes healing in the affected area.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for this specific combination product. Individual components have alternate names (Lidocaine/Lignocaine), but the combination is typically referred to by its constituent drugs. Some brand names include Anofresh Gold Cream and Pilorute Cream.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Calcium Dobesilate:** Improves microcirculation by decreasing capillary permeability and increasing venous tone. Exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-edema properties.
* **Hydrocortisone:** Exerts anti-inflammatory, antipruritic (anti-itch), and vasoconstrictive actions, reducing swelling, redness, and itching.
* **Lidocaine:** Blocks nerve signals, thus reducing pain and discomfort.
* **Phenylephrine:** Constricts blood vessels, helping shrink hemorrhoidal tissue.
* **Zinc Oxide:** Acts as a skin protectant, mild antiseptic, and astringent.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

This medication is primarily for topical application. Absorption, metabolism, and elimination data for this specific combination are not readily available. Information regarding individual components can be consulted.

**Mode of Action:**  The components work synergistically to alleviate symptoms. Calcium dobesilate strengthens capillaries and improves blood flow. Hydrocortisone reduces inflammation. Lidocaine provides local anesthesia. Phenylephrine acts as a decongestant, and zinc oxide protects the skin.

## **Dosage**

This medication is primarily for topical application. The dosage varies depending on the formulation (cream, ointment, suppository), severity of symptoms, and individual patient factors. Always follow prescribed instructions.

### **Standard Dosage**
