## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the treatment of hemorrhoids (piles) and anal fissures. It is classified as a topical anesthetic, anti-inflammatory, and vasoconstrictor agent.  The mechanism of action involves a synergistic effect of its components: Calcium Dobesilate improves vascular tone and reduces capillary permeability; Hydrocortisone provides anti-inflammatory and antipruritic effects; Lidocaine acts as a local anesthetic; and Zinc oxide promotes wound healing and acts as a mild antiseptic.

## **Alternate Names**

While no specific international nonproprietary name (INN) exists for this exact combination, the individual components have their respective INNs.  Several brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region. Some examples include Dobesil-H, Smuth Cream,  Dobelate Heal Cream, and Anasure cream.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Calcium Dobesilate enhances vascular tone, reduces capillary fragility and permeability, thus decreasing swelling and inflammation. Hydrocortisone, a corticosteroid, suppresses the inflammatory response and reduces itching. Lidocaine blocks nerve conduction, providing local anesthesia. Zinc oxide promotes wound healing and has antiseptic properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:** This combination is applied topically. Absorption of the individual components through the skin varies. Lidocaine is absorbed relatively quickly, while hydrocortisone absorption is limited. Calcium Dobesilate and zinc oxide have minimal systemic absorption. Metabolism and elimination pathways for each component are similar to their individual profiles when administered separately. Lidocaine is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Hydrocortisone undergoes hepatic metabolism. Information on the metabolism of calcium dobesilate and zinc oxide, when applied topically, is limited.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** A thin layer of the cream is applied to the clean, dry affected area two to three times daily or as directed by the physician. Application into the anal canal may be facilitated by the provided applicator.

#### **Children:** Use in children under 12 years of age is generally not recommended unless specifically directed by a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**  Dosage adjustments may be required in elderly patients, individuals with renal or hepatic impairment, and those with comorbid conditions. These adjustments should be made under the guidance of a physician based on the individual's specific circumstances.
