## **Usage**

- Calcium Dobesilate + Troxerutin is prescribed for conditions related to venous insufficiency and microcirculation disorders.  These include:
    - Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI): This encompasses symptoms like leg pain, swelling, cramps, and varicose veins.
    - Hemorrhoids (Piles): Swollen veins in the anus and rectum causing pain, bleeding, and itching.
    - Diabetic Retinopathy: Damage to blood vessels in the retina due to diabetes.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Vasoprotective agent, Venotonic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination drug works through the synergistic effects of its components:
    - Calcium Dobesilate: Stabilizes capillary walls, reduces capillary permeability and fragility, lowers blood viscosity, and may improve blood flow by enhancing nitric oxide production.
    - Troxerutin: A bioflavonoid that strengthens capillary walls, reduces capillary permeability, and improves lymphatic drainage, mitigating edema and inflammation.


## **Alternate Names**
- Doxium (common brand name for Calcium Dobesilate)
- There are a variety of brand names for the combination of Calcium Dobesilate and Troxerutin, which vary regionally. Some examples from India include: 
 - Osil Plus
- Rutin



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Calcium Dobesilate reduces capillary fragility and permeability, decreases blood viscosity, and improves microcirculation. Troxerutin strengthens capillary walls, reduces edema and inflammation, and improves lymphatic drainage. Together, they alleviate symptoms of venous insufficiency and related conditions.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - Absorption:  Calcium Dobesilate is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Troxerutin absorption varies depending on the formulation.
    - Metabolism:  The metabolic pathways of both drugs are not fully elucidated.
    - Elimination: Information on elimination pathways for both drugs is limited. It's known that some Calcium Dobesilate is excreted renally.
- **Mode of Action:** Calcium Dobesilate may increase prostacyclin (PGI2) synthesis and reduce thromboxane A2 (TXA2) production.  It is believed to inhibit certain glycosidases, impacting capillary wall structure. Troxerutin primarily acts by protecting capillary endothelium from oxidative stress and reducing inflammatory mediators.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Information is limited.  The effects observed suggest involvement of enzyme modulation and interference with inflammatory pathways, but specific receptors or neurotransmitters have not been clearly identified.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- Calcium Dobesilate: 500-1000 mg daily, divided into two or three doses, taken with meals.
- Troxerutin: Often combined in fixed-dose preparations with Calcium Dobesilate, typically 200-300 mg per dose.
- Treatment duration varies depending on the condition and severity but generally extends for several weeks.

#### **Children:** Safety and efficacy have not been established in children. Use is generally not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:**  Dosage adjustments may be needed based on renal function.

- **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for signs of agranulocytosis (e.g., fever, sore throat), renal function in patients with renal impairment, and liver function if necessary.

## **Popular Combinations**

Calcium Dobesilate is sometimes combined with other medications, such as hydrocortisone, lidocaine, and zinc oxide, in topical preparations for hemorrhoids. It may also be used with other systemic medications targeting venous insufficiency, but these combinations should be carefully considered based on individual patient needs.
