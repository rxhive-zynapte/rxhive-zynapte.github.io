## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed as an appetite stimulant, especially for patients experiencing anorexia or loss of appetite due to various underlying medical conditions. It also serves as a calcium supplement, crucial for growth and various bodily functions.

* **Pharmacological Classification:** Appetite stimulant, Calcium supplement
* **Mechanism of Action:** Cyproheptadine, an antihistamine with antiserotonergic properties, stimulates appetite by blocking serotonin's action on appetite regulation within the hypothalamus. Calcium gluconate and calcium lactate provide supplemental calcium.

## **Alternate Names**

* Cyproheptadine with Calcium
* Calcium Gluconate + Calcium Lactate + Cyproheptadine combination
* Appetite stimulant with Calcium

Some brand names include Calbeon Syrup, Calcyp Syrup, and Cyaptin with Calcium Suspension.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cyproheptadine acts as a serotonin antagonist in the hypothalamus, thereby increasing appetite. Calcium is essential for numerous physiological processes, including nerve conduction, muscle contraction, and bone formation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Cyproheptadine:** Well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, and excreted mainly in the urine.
* **Calcium Gluconate/Lactate:** Absorption varies depending on factors such as vitamin D levels and gastrointestinal pH. Excreted through urine and feces.

**Mode of Action:**  Cyproheptadine exerts its appetite-stimulating effect by antagonizing serotonin receptors (specifically 5-HT2) in the hypothalamus. Calcium salts provide elemental calcium which participates in various cellular functions, such as acting as a secondary messenger.

**Elimination Pathways:** Cyproheptadine is primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.  Calcium is eliminated through renal and fecal routes.

## **Dosage**

Dosage information for this specific combination needs to be confirmed with the prescribing doctor and should be tailored to individual patient needs.  General guidelines for individual components:

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Cyproheptadine:** 2-4 mg two to three times daily. Maximum dose: 0.5 mg/kg/day.
* **Calcium:** 500-1500 mg of elemental calcium daily, divided into doses.

#### **Children:**

* **Cyproheptadine:** Weight-based dosing varies by age. Consult a pediatric dosing guide.
* **Calcium:** Pediatric calcium requirements vary by age. Consult pediatric guidelines.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose modification is needed based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments may be needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Assess the individual's condition carefully to avoid potential drug interactions or complications.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage for specific clinical situations such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations should be determined based on individual patient requirements and is not specifically defined for this combination product.
