## **Usage**

Calcium Gluconate + Calcium Lactate is primarily used to treat hypocalcemia, a condition characterized by low blood calcium levels. This can be caused by various factors including hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, and renal failure.  It's also used in specific clinical situations like managing hyperkalemia and magnesium sulfate toxicity. It is classified as a mineral supplement and an electrolyte replenisher. The combination of the two calcium salts provides a readily available source of calcium ions, which play an essential role in various physiological processes, such as nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, blood coagulation, and bone formation.

## **Alternate Names**

Calcium Gluconate + Calcium Lactate doesn't have a universally recognized alternate name. However, it's sometimes referred to as Calcium Gluconolactate or simply Calcium Lactate Gluconate. It's important to differentiate this combined formulation from the individual salts. Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and geographical region.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Calcium is vital for numerous physiological functions. It acts as a crucial intracellular messenger, influencing muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, hormone release, and blood coagulation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:** Both calcium gluconate and calcium lactate are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, but the absorption of calcium is dependent on the presence of vitamin D and a properly functioning digestive system. The absorption rate is influenced by factors such as pH, presence of food, and individual variations.
* **Distribution:** Once absorbed, calcium is distributed throughout the body, with most of it stored in bones and teeth.
* **Metabolism:** Calcium itself is not metabolized. It's levels are regulated through hormonal control involving parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, and vitamin D.
* **Elimination:** Calcium is primarily excreted through the kidneys in urine, and a smaller portion is eliminated through feces.

**Mode of Action:** The combination provides a readily available source of calcium ions, correcting calcium deficits in hypocalcemia. This influences calcium-dependent cellular processes such as muscle and nerve function, blood clotting, and cell signalling.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
Dosage is based on the severity of hypocalcemia and the individual's clinical condition. It typically ranges from 1 to 15 grams of calcium gluconate administered intravenously. For less severe cases, oral supplementation may be used.
#### **Children:**
Pediatric dosing needs to be determined on a case-by-case basis according to the child's age, weight, and serum calcium levels. Safety considerations should be taken and calcium levels must be monitored in newborns.
#### **Special Cases:**
* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be needed depending on organ function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are necessary considering clearance rate and regular monitoring is needed.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Typically, hepatic function doesn't majorly affect the dosing of this medication.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Pre-existing conditions such as heart disease and other metabolic disorders require careful consideration.


### **Clinical Use Cases**
* **Intubation:** Administer calcium to prevent hypocalcemia during the procedure
* **Surgical Procedures:** Useful as a supplement, depending on the context of surgical procedures.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:**  Monitor calcium levels, supplementation may be needed in certain cases.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Administration of this combination depends on patient condition and the specific scenario.
* **Emergency Situations:** In hyperkalemia or magnesium toxicity, intravenous calcium is administered. The dose depends on the specific emergency and severity.


### **Dosage Adjustments**
Dose modifications must be made based on the patient’s clinical condition and renal function, and calcium levels should be regularly monitored during treatment.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**
Constipation, nausea, and vomiting are some of the commonly reported side effects.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Severe cardiac side effects including bradycardia, cardiac arrest, and arrhythmias are rare but serious side effects.


### **Long-Term Effects**
Chronic complications may include hypercalcemia from prolonged use, which can lead to various issues.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Clinically significant ADRs include severe hypotension and extravasation at the intravenous site, leading to tissue necrosis.


## **Contraindications**

Hypercalcemia and ventricular fibrillation are absolute contraindications. Caution is required in patients with a history of digitalis toxicity, renal calculi, sarcoidosis, and hyperparathyroidism.

## **Drug Interactions**

Calcium can interact with various medications, including certain antibiotics (tetracyclines, quinolones), bisphosphonates, digoxin, and thiazide diuretics. It can also affect the absorption of other drugs.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Limited data are available regarding the use of this combination during pregnancy. Consult a healthcare provider about risks and benefits, and inform your patients to not exceed recommended intake of calcium during pregnancy and lactation. The safety of calcium gluconate + calcium lactate during breastfeeding hasn't been fully established.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Provides calcium ions for essential physiological functions, correcting deficits.
* **Side Effects:** Constipation, nausea, vomiting; rarely, severe cardiac events and extravasation.
* **Contraindications:** Hypercalcemia, ventricular fibrillation.
* **Drug Interactions:** Antibiotics (tetracyclines, quinolones), bisphosphonates, digoxin, thiazide diuretics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult healthcare provider, monitor infants of treated mothers.

## **Popular Combinations**

This drug is rarely combined with other medications besides intravenous fluids for administration. However, it's important to note potential interactions as described in the Drug Interactions section.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Monitor serum calcium levels during therapy. Administer intravenous infusions slowly. Monitor for extravasation.
* **Specific Populations:**  Adjust dosage in patients with renal impairment. Monitor infants born to treated mothers for abnormal calcium levels. Caution is needed for geriatric and pediatric patients, especially neonates.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Alcohol, smoking, or specific dietary restrictions are not typically associated with this medicine. However, high oxalate or phytate intake may decrease calcium absorption.
