## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily used to relieve symptoms of the common cold and allergies.  It combines the effects of an antihistamine (chlorpheniramine maleate), a calcium supplement (calcium gluconate), and vitamin C. Chlorpheniramine maleate reduces allergy symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes. Calcium gluconate is used to treat hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels) and hypermagnesemia (high blood magnesium levels). Vitamin C acts as an antioxidant and contributes to various metabolic functions.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

*   Chlorpheniramine maleate: Antihistamine (H1-receptor antagonist)
*   Calcium gluconate: Calcium supplement, electrolyte replenisher
*   Vitamin C: Vitamin, antioxidant

**Mechanism of Action:**

Chlorpheniramine competes with histamine for H1-receptor sites, reducing histamine's effects. Calcium gluconate replenishes calcium levels essential for various physiological processes. Vitamin C acts as an antioxidant.

## **Alternate Names**

*   Allerpar
*   Allercalcin

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Chlorpheniramine maleate antagonizes the effects of histamine at H1 receptors.  Calcium gluconate increases serum calcium concentrations. Vitamin C enhances immune function.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Chlorpheniramine is well-absorbed orally. Calcium gluconate absorption varies based on the formulation and the presence of food. Vitamin C is absorbed in the small intestine via a sodium-dependent active transport mechanism.
*   **Metabolism:** Chlorpheniramine is metabolized in the liver. Calcium gluconate is not metabolized extensively. Ascorbic acid is reversibly oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid.
*   **Elimination:** Chlorpheniramine is excreted in urine. Calcium is eliminated primarily through renal excretion. Vitamin C and its metabolites are excreted renally.


## **Dosage**

The dosage information provided below is for general guidance only and may not encompass all possible scenarios. Always consult a qualified healthcare professional for personalized dosage recommendations based on individual patient needs.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One tablet containing 500 mg calcium gluconate, 4 mg chlorpheniramine maleate, and 50 mg vitamin C can be taken every 4-6 hours as needed. Do not exceed the recommended daily dose.  For hypocalcemia, intravenous administration of 500-2000 mg (5-20 ml) may be given.  The oral dose for hypocalcemia is 500-2000 mg two to four times daily. For hypermagnesemia, 1000-2000 mg (10-20 ml) IV is administered.

#### **Children:**

Dosage in children is determined by a physician based on the child's weight and age.  Consult a doctor before administering this medication to children.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Due to potential age-related decline in renal and hepatic function, dose adjustments might be necessary. Start with the lowest recommended dose and monitor closely.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary depending on the severity of renal impairment. Close monitoring of calcium levels is essential.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage should be individualized based on the specific comorbid condition.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical settings, such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations, should be determined by the attending physician based on individual patient needs and clinical context.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be necessary based on patient-specific factors, including renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, constipation.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), severe drowsiness, confusion, irregular heartbeat.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term use of chlorpheniramine maleate can lead to tolerance.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Anaphylaxis, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication, severe renal impairment, certain types of glaucoma.

## **Drug Interactions**

Alcohol, sedatives, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), other anticholinergic drugs.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult a doctor before using this medication during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.  Safety in pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been established.
