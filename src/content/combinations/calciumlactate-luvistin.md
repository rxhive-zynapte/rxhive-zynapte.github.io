## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used to address calcium deficiency and support bone health, particularly in cases of osteoporosis. Calcium lactate is classified as a mineral supplement, specifically a calcium supplement, providing elemental calcium necessary for various bodily functions. Luvistin's role within this combination requires further research to definitively establish, though certain literature propose potential anti-allergic properties.

## **Alternate Names**

A common alternate name for this combination is Calciluvin.  Specific brand names may vary based on region and manufacturer.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Calcium is crucial for several physiological processes, including bone mineralization, muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, blood coagulation, and enzyme regulation.  This combination aims to maintain adequate calcium levels, particularly benefiting bone health and overall physiological function. Calcium lactate serves as a readily absorbable source of calcium ions.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Calcium lactate is absorbed primarily in the small intestine. Absorption is enhanced by the presence of acidic gastric pH and is more efficient when taken with food. Concurrent intake of vitamin D also facilitates absorption. Conversely, substances such as oxalic acid (found in spinach and rhubarb) and phytic acid (present in bran and whole grains) can hinder calcium absorption.
* **Distribution:** After absorption, calcium is distributed throughout the body, with a significant portion stored in bones and teeth.  Calcium also crosses the placenta and enters breast milk.  Approximately 45% of calcium in the bloodstream is bound to plasma proteins.
* **Metabolism:**  Calcium itself doesn't undergo metabolism. Calcium lactate, however, is converted to calcium ions and lactate, which is further metabolized.
* **Elimination:** Unabsorbed calcium is primarily excreted in the feces.  A smaller portion is excreted through urine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  1000-1200 mg of elemental calcium per day, ideally divided into multiple doses taken with meals. Given that calcium lactate contains approximately 13% elemental calcium, this equates to roughly 7.7-9.2 grams of calcium lactate per day.

#### **Children:** Pediatric dosing is contingent upon age, weight, and individual calcium requirements. Consultation with a healthcare professional is essential for appropriate dosage recommendations in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  The standard adult dose is often applicable. However, it's essential to monitor renal function and calcium levels in this population.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are vital, depending on the level of renal impairment, with close monitoring of calcium levels being paramount.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Generally, dosage adjustments are not required in patients with hepatic dysfunction.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider underlying conditions like sarcoidosis, heart disease, or malabsorption syndromes that may influence calcium metabolism and warrant dosage adjustments.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations are not specifically defined for this combined medication.  Standard calcium guidelines usually apply.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications might be necessary based on patient-specific factors, including renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms impacting drug metabolism.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Constipation, gas, bloating, nausea, and vomiting are common side effects.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Hypercalcemia (elevated blood calcium levels) can occur with excessive intake, potentially leading to serious complications.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Prolonged excessive intake may contribute to kidney stones.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe hypercalcemia constitutes a serious ADR requiring immediate medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

Absolute contraindications include renal calculi, hypophosphatemia, and hypercalcemia. Relative contraindications encompass conditions affecting calcium metabolism, like sarcoidosis.

## **Drug Interactions**

Calcium can interact with various medications, including digoxin, bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate), tetracycline antibiotics, levothyroxine, quinolone antibiotics, and thiazide diuretics. It may also impact the absorption of certain medications. It is important to consider concurrent usage of other calcium supplements or antacids.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Calcium lactate is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, it's advisable to consult a doctor regarding dosing, especially during pregnancy.  Adequate calcium intake is essential during pregnancy and breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Supplements calcium levels, which are vital for various physiological processes.
* **Side Effects:** Constipation, gas, bloating, nausea, vomiting. Rarely, hypercalcemia.
* **Contraindications:** Renal calculi, hypophosphatemia, hypercalcemia.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Digoxin, bisphosphonates, tetracyclines, levothyroxine, quinolones, thiazides.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Generally safe; consult a doctor regarding dosage.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 1000-1200 mg elemental calcium/day (divided). Pediatric and special population dosing should be determined by a healthcare professional.

## **Popular Combinations**

Calcium is often combined with vitamin D to improve absorption.

## **Precautions**

Pre-screening for allergies, metabolic disorders, and organ dysfunction is recommended. Precautions are necessary for specific populations including pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, children, elderly, and individuals with kidney issues. Patients should be advised about potential lifestyle considerations, including limitations on alcohol, smoking, and certain dietary factors.
