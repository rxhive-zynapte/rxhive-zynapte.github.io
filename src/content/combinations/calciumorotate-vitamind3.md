## **Usage**

Calcium Orotate + Vitamin D3 is prescribed for the prevention and management of conditions arising from calcium deficiency, such as osteoporosis, osteomalacia (rickets in children), hypoparathyroidism, and latent tetany. It also aids in conditions where vitamin D deficiency contributes to calcium malabsorption.  It is classified as a nutritional supplement or a vitamin and mineral combination.

The mechanism of action involves calcium orotate providing a readily absorbable source of calcium for bone mineralization and other physiological functions. Vitamin D3 facilitates calcium absorption from the gut and regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis, contributing to bone health.


## **Alternate Names** 

There is no internationally recognized non-proprietary name for this specific combination. However, the components are individually known as calcium orotate and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Several brand names may exist depending on the manufacturer and region. One example found in the sources is CALOXY.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Calcium is essential for various physiological processes, including bone mineralization, muscle contraction, nerve transmission, and blood clotting. Vitamin D3 plays a crucial role in calcium absorption from the intestine and maintaining calcium balance.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Calcium orotate is believed to have better absorption compared to other calcium salts. Vitamin D3 is absorbed from the intestine and undergoes hepatic metabolism. Both calcium and vitamin D3 can be stored in the body (bones and adipose tissue, respectively). Calcium is primarily excreted through the kidneys, while vitamin D3 metabolites are eliminated through bile and feces.  The orotate component is metabolized and incorporated into pyrimidine synthesis pathways. Specific details on receptor binding, enzyme interactions, or neurotransmitter modulation are not typically described for this combination.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The general adult dose is 1000-1300 mg of elemental calcium and 200-800 international units of vitamin D3 daily, often divided into multiple doses. Combination supplements typically contain 200-400 IU of vitamin D3 per dose. Dosing should be individualized based on dietary intake, underlying conditions, and serum calcium levels.

#### **Children:**

Dosage in children should be determined based on age, weight, and calcium/vitamin D status. Dosing should not exceed the recommended adult doses.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically recommended. However, renal function should be considered in the elderly.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution is advised in patients with severe renal impairment. Specific dosage adjustment recommendations are limited.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage modifications are mentioned. However, severe hepatic impairment may influence vitamin D metabolism and should be considered.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized adjustments may be necessary based on other medical conditions, especially involving calcium homeostasis or vitamin D metabolism.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage for specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, and ICU use is not relevant to calcium orotate + vitamin D3 supplements.  These scenarios typically involve different medications.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments might be needed in severe renal or hepatic impairment and other conditions affecting calcium/vitamin D metabolism.  

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Constipation, gas, bloating, stomach upset.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium) with symptoms like nausea, vomiting, constipation, muscle weakness, confusion, and increased thirst.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Kidney stones with prolonged high doses or in susceptible individuals.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions are rare but possible.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any component, hypercalcemia, hypervitaminosis D, kidney stones, certain types of malabsorption syndromes.

## **Drug Interactions**

Some medications, including certain antibiotics and diuretics, may interact with calcium or food intake.  Vitamin D can interact with certain medications affecting its metabolism.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

This combination is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding at recommended doses.  However, it's essential to ensure intake does not exceed recommended levels.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Calcium supplementation for bone health and vitamin D3 for calcium absorption.
* **Side Effects:** Gastrointestinal issues, potential for hypercalcemia.
* **Contraindications:** Hypercalcemia, hypervitaminosis D, hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:** Some medications, including certain antibiotics and diuretics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe at recommended doses.
* **Dosage:**  Varies depending on age, conditions, and serum levels; typically, 1000-1300 mg calcium and 200-800 IU Vitamin D3 daily.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Serum calcium levels.

## **Popular Combinations**

Calcium orotate + Vitamin D3 is often used as a standalone supplement.  It can be part of broader regimens including other vitamins and minerals.

## **Precautions**

Monitor calcium levels regularly, particularly in patients with renal impairment. Patients should be advised about dietary calcium sources.
