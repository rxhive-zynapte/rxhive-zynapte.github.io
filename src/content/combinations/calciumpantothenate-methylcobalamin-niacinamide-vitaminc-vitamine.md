## **Usage**

This combination of vitamins is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of vitamin deficiencies, especially those of the B complex, vitamin C, and vitamin E. It supports overall health and well-being.  It may be prescribed for conditions like:

* **B-Complex Deficiencies**: Conditions such as beriberi (thiamine deficiency), ariboflavinosis (riboflavin deficiency), pellagra (niacin deficiency), and peripheral neuropathy (vitamin B12 deficiency).
* **Vitamin C Deficiency**: Scurvy
* **Vitamin E Deficiency**: Ataxia, peripheral neuropathy
* **Other Conditions**: Sometimes used as supportive therapy for conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and during pregnancy.

**Pharmacological Classification**: Vitamin Supplement, Dietary Supplement

**Mechanism of Action**: This combination provides essential vitamins that play crucial roles in various metabolic processes.


## **Alternate Names**

* Vitamin B Complex with Vitamin C and E
* Multivitamin with B complex, C, and E
* B vitamins with Ascorbic Acid and Tocopherol



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics**:

* **Calcium Pantothenate**:  A precursor to coenzyme A, essential for fatty acid synthesis and metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and the synthesis of cholesterol and steroid hormones.
* **Methylcobalamin**:  A coenzyme for methionine synthase, essential for DNA synthesis, nerve cell function, and red blood cell formation.
* **Niacinamide**: A precursor to NAD and NADP, crucial for energy metabolism, DNA repair, and cell signaling.
* **Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)**:  An antioxidant, necessary for collagen synthesis, immune function, and iron absorption.
* **Vitamin E (Tocopherol)**: An antioxidant that protects cell membranes from damage.

**Pharmacokinetics**:

* **Absorption**: These vitamins are generally well-absorbed orally.
* **Metabolism**: Each vitamin undergoes specific metabolic pathways.  Vitamin C is primarily metabolized in the liver. Vitamin E is partially metabolized in the liver. B vitamins are metabolized in various tissues.
* **Elimination**: Primarily renal excretion, but some biliary excretion may occur.

**Mode of Action**:  Each vitamin acts as a cofactor or coenzyme in various enzymatic reactions essential for cellular function.
