## **Usage**

This combination is generally prescribed to address calcium deficiency and ensure adequate iodine intake, primarily for supporting bone health and thyroid function. Calcium phosphate is used for calcium deficiencies, while sodium iodide is used for iodine deficiency, which can lead to hypothyroidism and goiter.  Calcium phosphate is classified as a mineral supplement, and sodium iodide is classified as an iodine supplement. They do not belong to pharmacological classifications like antibiotics or analgesics. Calcium phosphate provides the body with calcium and phosphate necessary for bone health, while sodium iodide provides iodine needed for thyroid hormone synthesis.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no officially recognized alternate names for the combination of Calcium Phosphate + Sodium Iodide, as this is not a single drug but rather two separate supplements that can be co-prescribed. However, depending on the specific salt forms used, the components may be referred to by slightly different chemical names (e.g., tricalcium phosphate, monosodium phosphate). The combination of Calcium Phosphate and Sodium Iodide is marketed under the brand name Paracol (eye drops).  It's important to note that sodium iodide I-131, used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer, is a radioactive form of iodine and is distinct from the standard sodium iodide supplement.

## **How It Works**

**Calcium Phosphate:**  Calcium is vital for bone mineralization, nerve function, muscle contraction, and blood clotting. Phosphate plays a crucial role in bone formation, energy production, and cellular signaling.  Calcium phosphate is absorbed primarily in the small intestine. Calcium absorption is influenced by vitamin D levels and various dietary factors. It is excreted by the kidneys.

**Sodium Iodide:**  Iodide is actively transported into thyroid follicular cells by the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). Within the thyroid, it undergoes oxidation and is incorporated into tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin to form thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). These hormones regulate metabolism, growth, and development.  Sodium iodide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is excreted primarily by the kidneys. Small amounts are also excreted in breast milk and saliva.

## **Dosage**

As this is not a fixed-dose combination drug, dosage information is provided for each component separately.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Calcium (as calcium phosphate):** The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for adults aged 19-50 is 1000 mg. For females 51 and older, the RDA is 1200 mg.
* **Iodine (as sodium iodide):**  The RDA for adults is 150 mcg per day.

#### **Children:**

* **Calcium (as calcium phosphate):**  The RDA varies depending on the age. 
* **Iodine (as sodium iodide):** The RDA for children also varies with age.

#### **Special Cases:**

Dosage adjustments for both calcium and iodine may be necessary in elderly patients, individuals with renal impairment, hepatic dysfunction, or other comorbid conditions. This should be determined by the physician based on individual patient needs.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The clinical use cases provided (intubation, surgical procedures, etc.) are not relevant to calcium phosphate or standard sodium iodide supplementation.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments should be made based on individual patient-specific factors like renal function, concomitant medications, and monitored serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and thyroid hormones.

## **Side Effects**

### **Calcium Phosphate:**

**Common:** Constipation, nausea, vomiting.

**Rare but Serious:** Hypercalcemia (with excessive intake).

### **Sodium Iodide:**

**Common:** Nausea, vomiting, iodism (with prolonged or high-dose use â€“ metallic taste, acne, skin rash).

**Rare but Serious:** Angioedema, thyroid dysfunction (with prolonged or high-dose use).


## **Contraindications**

### **Calcium Phosphate:**

Hypercalcemia, severe renal impairment.

### **Sodium Iodide:**

Hypersensitivity to iodine.

## **Drug Interactions**

### **Calcium Phosphate:** May interfere with the absorption of certain antibiotics (tetracyclines, quinolones) and bisphosphonates.

### **Sodium Iodide:**  May interact with lithium (increased risk of hypothyroidism), potassium-sparing diuretics (increased risk of hyperkalemia), and antithyroid medications.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

### **Calcium Phosphate:** Generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding when taken as directed. Excessive intake should be avoided.

### **Sodium Iodide:** Adequate iodine intake is essential during pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, excessive intake can be harmful. Consult clinical guidelines for recommended intakes.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

Refer to the individual profiles for Calcium Phosphate and Sodium Iodide in the sections above, as this combination is not a single drug.

## **Popular Combinations**

Calcium and vitamin D are often combined to enhance calcium absorption. Sodium iodide may be included in multivitamin/mineral supplements.

## **Precautions**

Monitor calcium, phosphate, and thyroid hormone levels regularly, especially in patients with renal or thyroid disorders.  Screen for allergies to iodine before administering sodium iodide. Assess dietary calcium and iodine intake to avoid excessive supplementation.
