## **Usage**

This combination liniment is prescribed for the short-term relief of pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal and joint disorders such as:

* Muscle strains and sprains
* Arthritis (osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis)
* Back pain (low back pain)
* Stiff neck
* Sports injuries
* Bruises

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This liniment is a combination of drugs from several classes including:

* Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) - Diclofenac
* Topical analgesic and rubefacient - Capsaicin, Menthol, Camphor
* Muscle relaxant - Mephenesin


**Mechanism of Action:**

This liniment employs a multimodal mechanism of action, targeting pain and inflammation through various pathways:

* **Diclofenac:** Inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, thus decreasing pain and inflammation.
* **Capsaicin:** Depletes substance P, a neurotransmitter involved in pain transmission, leading to desensitization of nociceptors.
* **Menthol and Camphor:** Act as counterirritants, causing vasodilation and a cooling sensation that distracts from pain perception. They also enhance the penetration of other topical agents.
* **Mephenesin:** Acts centrally on the spinal cord and brainstem to reduce muscle spasm and stiffness.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is marketed under various brand names including:

* Doil-MR Liniment
* Fenlong MR Liniment
* Fixoil Liniment


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

The combined effects of the ingredients provide analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and muscle relaxant properties.  Diclofenac reduces pain and inflammation. Capsaicin desensitizes pain receptors.  Menthol and camphor act as counterirritants and enhance drug penetration. Mephenesin relaxes muscles and relieves spasms.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** The drug is absorbed through the skin into the underlying tissues.  The extent of systemic absorption is generally low.
* **Metabolism:** Diclofenac is primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP enzymes.  The metabolism of the other ingredients is less well-characterized.
* **Elimination:** Diclofenac metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Other components are likely excreted through renal and/or hepatic pathways.

**Mode of Action:**

* Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:  See *Mechanism of Action* above.
* Elimination Pathways: Primarily renal and hepatic.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply 15-30 drops to the affected area and gently massage until absorbed.  Repeat 2-4 times daily as directed by the physician.

#### **Children:**

Not recommended for children under 14 years of age.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to increased risk of systemic absorption. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dosage adjustment may be needed.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dose modification may be required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions** (e.g., asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, bleeding disorders, peptic ulcer disease): Close monitoring is required, and dose adjustments may be necessary. Caution is advised, especially in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to NSAIDs.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication is not intended for clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  It is for topical application only for musculoskeletal pain.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient factors, including renal or hepatic impairment, other medical conditions, and concomitant medications. Consult a physician to determine the appropriate dose modification.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Itching
* Redness
* Irritation
* Burning sensation at the application site

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (e.g., rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Severe skin reactions (e.g., blistering, peeling)
* Systemic effects of diclofenac (e.g., gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney problems)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Data on long-term effects is limited. Prolonged use can potentially lead to skin irritation or sensitization. Systemic effects are less likely with topical use but cannot be entirely ruled out.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

See *Rare but Serious Side Effects* above.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication
* Third trimester of pregnancy
* Open wounds, broken skin, or irritated skin
* Patients with a history of aspirin-sensitive asthma

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Oral NSAIDs:** Increased risk of systemic side effects.
* **Anticoagulants:** Increased risk of bleeding.
* **Antihypertensives:** May reduce the efficacy of antihypertensives.
* **CYP450 Interactions:**  Diclofenac is metabolized by CYP enzymes, primarily CYP2C9.  Enzyme inducers or inhibitors may affect diclofenac levels.  The other ingredients have less well-characterized metabolic pathways.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Not recommended during the third trimester.  Use during the first and second trimesters only if clearly needed and under close medical supervision.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution as there is potential for neonatal exposure through breast milk.
