## **Usage**

- This combination is prescribed for topical relief of musculoskeletal pain and inflammation.  It is indicated for conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, back pain, sprains, strains, stiff neck, and sports injuries.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Topical NSAID (Diclofenac), topical analgesic and rubefacient (Capsaicin, Menthol, Camphor), and muscle relaxant (Mephenesin).
- **Mechanism of Action:** This liniment combines multiple actions for pain and inflammation relief. Diclofenac inhibits COX enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis. Mephenesin acts as a muscle relaxant. Capsaicin blocks pain signals, while Camphor and Menthol produce cooling and warming sensations, enhancing drug penetration.

## **Alternate Names**

- Fenlong MR Liniment
- Doil-MR Liniment
- Fixoil Liniment
- Other brand names may exist.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, decreasing prostaglandin production.  Mephenesin, a muscle relaxant, acts centrally on the spinal cord and brainstem to reduce muscle spasm and stiffness. Capsaicin depletes substance P, a neurotransmitter involved in pain transmission. Camphor and menthol act as counterirritants, producing vasodilation and cooling/warming sensations. They also enhance the penetration of other topical agents.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** The topical application limits systemic absorption.  However, some diclofenac may be absorbed systemically.  Mephenesin is believed to be absorbed through the skin and act centrally.  The pharmacokinetics of camphor, capsaicin, and menthol when applied topically in this combination are not well-defined.
- **Mode of Action:**  See Pharmacodynamics.
- **Elimination pathways:** Limited information is available on the specific elimination pathways of this combination.  Systemically absorbed diclofenac is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions** (e.g., asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, bleeding disorders, peptic ulcer disease): Close monitoring is required, and dose adjustments may be necessary.  Caution is advised, especially in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to NSAIDs.
