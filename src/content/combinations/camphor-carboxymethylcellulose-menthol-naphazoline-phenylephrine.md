## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily used to treat allergic conjunctivitis (eye allergy) and relieve symptoms associated with minor eye irritations. These symptoms include redness, itching, burning, watering, dryness, and discomfort caused by allergens (e.g., pollen, dust, pet dander), environmental factors (e.g., wind, sun, smoke), or contact lens wear.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Decongestant, ocular lubricant, topical analgesic.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Naphazoline and phenylephrine are decongestants that constrict blood vessels in the conjunctiva, reducing redness, swelling, and itching. Carboxymethylcellulose is a lubricant that mimics natural tears, providing relief from dryness. Camphor and menthol produce a cooling sensation, further soothing irritated eyes.

## **Alternate Names**

Napaglare, Briscool Eye Drops, Lacricool Eye Drop, RECOOL PLUS Eye Drops, Ocurest Plus Eye Drops, Mahakool Eye Drops, Naphacare Eye Drop.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Naphazoline and phenylephrine act as α-adrenergic agonists, causing vasoconstriction in the eye's blood vessels. This reduces redness, itching, and swelling. Carboxymethylcellulose increases tear film viscosity, providing lubrication. Camphor and menthol stimulate cold receptors, creating a cooling sensation.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** The drugs are absorbed locally in the eye.  Systemic absorption is minimal. Metabolism and elimination pathways for this ophthalmic combination are not well-defined.  It's assumed that minimal amounts absorbed systemically would undergo hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.

- **Mode of Action:** Naphazoline and phenylephrine bind to α-adrenergic receptors on the vascular smooth muscle of the conjunctiva, leading to vasoconstriction. Carboxymethylcellulose physically lubricates the ocular surface. Camphor and menthol activate TRPM8 receptors, which are cold-sensing ion channels, leading to a cooling sensation.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily local elimination through tear drainage; minimal systemic absorption undergoes likely hepatic metabolism with renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Instill 1-2 drops into the affected eye(s) every 3-4 hours as needed. Do not exceed the recommended dosage.

#### **Children:**

Use in children should be under the guidance of a physician.  Safety and efficacy in children below 6 years of age have not been established. Some sources suggest using with caution in children younger than 12.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution. Monitor for cardiovascular side effects like increased blood pressure and heart rate.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Monitor renal function.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Monitor liver function.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with hypertension, heart disease, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Close monitoring is recommended.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is typically not used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its use is primarily for outpatient management of allergic conjunctivitis and minor eye irritations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments should be made based on individual patient response and tolerability. Patients with pre-existing conditions should be monitored closely for potential side effects.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Burning or stinging sensation in eyes, blurred vision, headache, eye irritation, eye pain, dilated pupils, photophobia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Systemic effects like increased blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and difficulty urinating (especially in patients with BPH) are rare but possible.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Rebound congestion (worsening of symptoms upon discontinuation) can occur with prolonged use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions (rare) including rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, and trouble breathing.


## **Contraindications**

Narrow-angle glaucoma, hypersensitivity to any component. Use with caution in patients with heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid disorders, BPH.

## **Drug Interactions**

Other decongestant eye drops (oxymetazoline), antihistamine eye drops (ketotifen), anti-inflammatory eye drops (dexamethasone), MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers, antihypertensives, cardiac glycosides.  Concurrent use with other ophthalmic drugs should be cautious and physician-guided.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established. Consult a doctor before use.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  α-adrenergic agonists (naphazoline and phenylephrine) cause vasoconstriction; carboxymethylcellulose lubricates; camphor and menthol produce cooling sensation.
- **Side Effects:** Burning/stinging, blurred vision, headache, rebound congestion (with prolonged use).
- **Contraindications:** Narrow-angle glaucoma, hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:** Other eye drops, MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers, antihypertensives, cardiac glycosides.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult a doctor before use.

## **Popular Combinations**

This is itself a combination product. Combining with other ophthalmic medications should be done cautiously under medical supervision.

## **Precautions**

Avoid touching dropper tip. Remove contact lenses before use and wait 15 minutes before reinserting. Avoid concurrent use of other eye medications unless prescribed. Consult a doctor if irritation persists or worsens, if you experience changes in vision, or if any eye condition lasts over 72 hours. Pre-screening for relevant comorbidities (heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, thyroid disorders, BPH) is advisable. Use with caution in pregnant/breastfeeding women, children, and elderly. Alcohol and tobacco may increase systemic side effects like drowsiness or dizziness.
