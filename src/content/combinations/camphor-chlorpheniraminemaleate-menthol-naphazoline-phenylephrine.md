## **Usage**

This ophthalmic solution is primarily used for symptomatic relief of allergic conjunctivitis and its associated symptoms like redness, itching, tearing, and burning sensation in the eyes.  It can also provide relief from minor eye irritation caused by environmental factors such as dust, smoke, or pollen.  It also provides relief from eye redness, itching, burning sensation, and discomfort due to dryness and exposure to wind, sun, or dust. In addition, it is used to treat computer vision syndrome (digital eye strain) associated with watery eyes, itching, and redness of the eye.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This combination drug contains components belonging to the following classes:

* **Decongestant:** Naphazoline, Phenylephrine
* **Antihistamine:** Chlorpheniramine maleate
* **Counterirritant/Topical Analgesic:** Camphor, Menthol

**Mechanism of Action:**

* **Naphazoline and Phenylephrine:** These are α-adrenergic agonists that constrict conjunctival blood vessels, reducing redness and swelling.
* **Chlorpheniramine Maleate:** An H1-receptor antagonist that blocks histamine's effects, reducing itching, tearing, and other allergic manifestations.
* **Camphor and Menthol:** Provide a cooling and soothing sensation, relieving irritation and discomfort.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication is available under various brand names, including (but not limited to) Ocurest AH Eye Drops, Suthin Eye Drop, Clearine, Fenx, N-Cool, Allerol, Celos N, Freydex Drop, Parinose, Decon Eye, and Decazole.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* Phenylephrine and naphazoline are decongestants that constrict blood vessels in the eye, reducing redness and swelling.
* Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that blocks the effects of histamine, relieving itching, tearing, and other allergic symptoms.
* Menthol and camphor provide a cooling sensation, further soothing the eye.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  The pharmacokinetic profile of this combination product has not been specifically studied. However, information regarding individual components is as follows:

* Naphazoline and phenylephrine primarily exert their effects locally in the eye, with minimal systemic absorption.
* Chlorpheniramine is absorbed systemically after ophthalmic administration, though plasma concentrations remain low. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine.
* Menthol and camphor are readily absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes.  Menthol is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine, while camphor is metabolized and excreted through the kidneys and lungs.


**Mode of Action:**

* Naphazoline and phenylephrine stimulate α-adrenergic receptors in the conjunctival blood vessels, leading to vasoconstriction.
* Chlorpheniramine competitively binds to H1 receptors, preventing histamine from binding and exerting its effects.
* Menthol and camphor activate TRPM8 receptors, producing a cooling sensation.

**Elimination Pathways:** The individual components are eliminated through a combination of hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.
