## **Usage**

This ophthalmic solution is primarily prescribed for the temporary relief of minor eye symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis, such as:

*   Itching
*   Redness
*   Burning
*   Excessive tearing (Epiphora)
*   Discomfort and dryness.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This combination product encompasses several classes of drugs:

*   Decongestants: Naphazoline, Phenylephrine
*   Lubricant: Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (Hypromellose)
*   Topical Analgesics/Counterirritants: Camphor, Menthol

**Mechanism of Action:**

*   Naphazoline and Phenylephrine are sympathomimetic amines that act as alpha-adrenergic agonists, constricting blood vessels in the conjunctiva to reduce redness and swelling.
*   Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose is a viscosity-enhancing agent that lubricates the ocular surface, providing relief from dryness and discomfort.
*   Camphor and Menthol stimulate cold receptors, creating a cooling sensation that soothes itching and irritation.



## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication is marketed under various brand names (e.g., Zoline-Plus, Neph-M Plus, Allercool, Analar, Ocunap, Mahakool, Milviz). Regional variations may also exist.  The components can also be found in other products with differing formulations.



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** As described in the mechanism of action, naphazoline and phenylephrine constrict conjunctival blood vessels, hypromellose lubricates the ocular surface, and camphor/menthol provide a cooling sensation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Limited information is available on the pharmacokinetics of this specific combination. Each component has its own pharmacokinetic profile. Naphazoline and phenylephrine are absorbed systemically to some extent after topical ocular administration. Hepatic metabolism is the primary route of elimination for both. Hypromellose is not absorbed systemically.  Camphor and menthol are readily absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes and are extensively metabolized in the liver.  Elimination pathways are primarily renal.



**Mode of Action:**

Naphazoline and phenylephrine act as alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists, leading to vasoconstriction. Hypromellose increases tear film viscosity.  Camphor and menthol activate TRPM8 receptors (transient receptor potential melastatin 8), which are cold-sensitive ion channels.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism and renal excretion for naphazoline and phenylephrine.  Renal for menthol and camphor metabolites.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Instill 1-2 drops into the affected eye(s) every 3-4 hours as needed. Do not exceed more than 4 doses per day.

#### **Children:**

Use in children should be under the guidance of a physician. Dosage will be determined based on the child's age and weight.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lowest recommended dose and monitor closely for systemic side effects. Consider reducing dosing frequency.
*   **Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be necessary. Consult a nephrologist/hepatologist to assess the required adjustment.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, and closed-angle glaucoma.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU. Its primary use is for temporary relief of allergic conjunctivitis symptoms.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments should be made on a patient-specific basis, considering age, renal/hepatic function, coexisting medical conditions, and response to therapy.





## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Transient blurred vision
*   Burning or stinging upon instillation
*   Pupillary dilation (Mydriasis)
*   Eye irritation

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Systemic effects (e.g., headache, dizziness, nervousness, tremors, tachycardia, hypertension) are possible, especially with overuse.
*   Allergic reactions

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic use can lead to rebound congestion.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, though rare, require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to any component
*   Narrow-angle or closed-angle glaucoma

## **Drug Interactions**

*   Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): Can potentiate the pressor effects of phenylephrine.
*   Beta-blockers: May lead to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation.
*   Other sympathomimetics: Additive effects may occur.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been definitively established. Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** See Usage section.
*   **Side Effects:** Blurred vision, burning/stinging, mydriasis, eye irritation. Rarely: systemic effects, allergic reactions.
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, narrow-angle glaucoma.
*   **Drug Interactions:** MAOIs, beta-blockers, other sympathomimetics.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Safety not established.
*   **Dosage:** See Dosage section.
*   **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for systemic effects, especially in elderly patients or those with comorbid conditions. Intraocular pressure should be monitored with prolonged use.

## **Popular Combinations**

This combination itself represents a commonly used formulation.  Individual components may be combined with other drugs in different formulations for specific indications.

## **Precautions**

*   General Precautions: Pre-screening for allergies, glaucoma, cardiovascular disease, and other relevant conditions.
*   Pregnant Women: Use with caution.
*   Breastfeeding Mothers: Use with caution.
*   Children & Elderly: Adjust dosage as needed.
*   Lifestyle Considerations: Avoid driving immediately after use due to potential blurred vision.
