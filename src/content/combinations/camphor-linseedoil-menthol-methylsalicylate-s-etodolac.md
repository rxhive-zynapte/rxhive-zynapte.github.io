## **Usage**

This topical medication is used to relieve musculoskeletal pain associated with conditions such as sprains, strains, arthritis, bruises, and backaches.  It combines the anti-inflammatory action of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with the counterirritant effects of camphor, menthol, and methyl salicylate.

## **Alternate Names**

Setolac Gel, Proxym Gel, S-Etodolac + Camphor + Menthol + Methyl Salicylate + Linseed Oil Gel

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** S-etodolac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, primarily COX-2. This leads to a decrease in prostaglandin synthesis, reducing pain and inflammation. Camphor, menthol, and methyl salicylate act as counterirritants, producing sensations of warmth and coolness that distract from the pain. Linseed oil serves as an emollient, softening and soothing the skin, and may enhance the absorption of the active ingredients.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  S-etodolac is absorbed through the skin, reaching therapeutic levels in the affected area. Limited information is available on the percutaneous absorption of the other components. Methyl salicylate is metabolized to salicylic acid. S-etodolac is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine. Camphor is highly lipophilic, extensively metabolized, and excreted primarily in the urine. Menthol is absorbed percutaneously, metabolized in the liver, and excreted in urine and bile. Methyl salicylate is hydrolyzed to salicylic acid, and then metabolized by conjugation with glycine or glucuronic acid and eliminated renally.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a thin layer to the affected area 3-4 times daily. Do not apply to broken or irritated skin.
