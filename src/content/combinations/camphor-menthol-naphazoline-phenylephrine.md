## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the temporary relief of minor eye symptoms like itching, redness, and irritation caused by allergies (e.g., allergic conjunctivitis, hay fever), environmental irritants (e.g., dust, smoke, wind, sun), or eye strain (e.g., computer vision syndrome).  It is also used for the temporary relief of burning and tearing associated with these conditions.

Its pharmacological classifications include:

* **Decongestant:** Naphazoline and phenylephrine are vasoconstrictors that shrink swollen blood vessels in the conjunctiva, reducing redness and swelling.
* **Anti-allergic:**  While this combination itself does not intrinsically contain an anti-allergic like some similar formulations, the decongestants provide relief from allergy symptoms.
* **Counterirritant/Topical Anesthetic:**  Camphor and menthol create a cooling sensation that soothes irritation and discomfort.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no single international non-proprietary name (INN) for this combination. It is often referred to by the names of its individual ingredients. Several brand names exist under which it's marketed (e.g. Andre I-Kul, Ocurest, Briscool).

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Naphazoline and Phenylephrine:** These are sympathomimetic amines acting as α-adrenergic agonists, causing vasoconstriction of the conjunctival blood vessels, thus reducing eye redness and swelling.
* **Camphor and Menthol:** These agents stimulate cold receptors, creating a cooling sensation which masks the discomfort of irritation and has a mild analgesic effect.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** The drugs are absorbed locally into the eye tissues after topical application. Systemic absorption is minimal, but can increase if the nasal mucosa is compromised or if excessively high doses are applied.
* **Metabolism and Elimination:** Information on the specific metabolic pathways of each component in ophthalmic form is limited. However, when systemically absorbed, naphazoline and phenylephrine are primarily metabolized in the liver.  Camphor and menthol are extensively metabolized, mostly in the liver, and eliminated through the kidneys.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Instill 1-2 drops in the affected eye(s) every 3-4 hours, or as directed by a physician.

#### **Children:** Use in children under 12 is generally not recommended unless under the specific direction of a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to the potential for increased systemic absorption and cardiovascular side effects. Monitoring blood pressure and heart rate is advisable.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use cautiously. Monitor for systemic side effects.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use cautiously. Monitor for systemic side effects.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with hypertension, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), as phenylephrine can exacerbate these conditions. Patients with closed-angle glaucoma should not use this medication.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination drug is not typically employed in clinical scenarios such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU. Its use is primarily limited to outpatient management of minor eye irritation and allergies.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be needed based on patient response and tolerability.  Start with the lowest recommended dose and increase as needed.  For patients with renal or hepatic impairment, close monitoring is crucial, and dosage reductions may be considered.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**
* Transient blurred vision
* Burning or stinging upon instillation
* Eye pain or irritation
* Increased sensitivity to light (photophobia)
* Watery eyes
* Mydriasis (pupil dilation) - particularly with prolonged use.
* Rebound congestion (worsening of symptoms) with prolonged or excessive use

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Allergic reactions (e.g., rash, itching, swelling of the face, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing)
* Systemic effects such as headache, dizziness, nervousness, tremor, or changes in heart rate or blood pressure (rare, but possible with increased systemic absorption)
* Acute angle-closure glaucoma (in predisposed individuals)

### **Long-Term Effects**

Prolonged or excessive use can lead to rebound congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa) which is characterized by worsening nasal congestion. Long-term use can also result in dependence and tolerance to the decongestant effects.



## **Contraindications**

* **Absolute Contraindications:**  Narrow-angle glaucoma, concurrent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), hypersensitivity to any of the components.
* **Relative Contraindications:** Cardiovascular disease (e.g., hypertension, coronary artery disease), hyperthyroidism, diabetes, BPH, severe hepatic or renal impairment.

## **Drug Interactions**


* MAOIs (e.g., selegiline, phenelzine) – can lead to severe hypertensive crisis.
* Beta-blockers (e.g., atenolol, propranolol) - can lead to paradoxical hypertension or reduced efficacy of beta-blockers.
* Tricyclic antidepressants – can potentiate the cardiovascular effects of phenylephrine.
* Other sympathomimetic drugs – can lead to additive effects and increase the risk of side effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been definitively established. Phenylephrine is categorized as Pregnancy Category C, indicating a lack of adequate and well-controlled studies in humans.  Naphazoline, camphor, and menthol also have limited safety data in pregnancy. Therefore, the use of this combination during pregnancy or while breastfeeding should be limited to cases where the potential benefits outweigh the risks.  Consult a physician before use.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  α-adrenergic agonists causing vasoconstriction (naphazoline, phenylephrine), counterirritants with mild analgesic effect (camphor, menthol).
* **Side Effects:** Blurred vision, burning/stinging, eye pain/irritation, photophobia, watery eyes, rebound congestion.
* **Contraindications:** Narrow-angle glaucoma, concurrent MAOI use, hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:** MAOIs, beta-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, sympathomimetics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution; consult a physician.
* **Dosage:** 1-2 drops in affected eye(s) every 3-4 hours.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Eye pressure, heart rate, blood pressure (especially in elderly and those with comorbidities).

## **Popular Combinations**

This combination itself represents a common formulation. The addition of an antihistamine like chlorpheniramine is seen in some products, which may offer enhanced allergy relief.

## **Precautions**

Wash hands before and after use. Avoid touching the tip of the bottle to any surface. Remove contact lenses before instillation and wait at least 15 minutes before reinserting. Do not use if the solution changes color or becomes cloudy.  Inform patients about the potential for rebound congestion with prolonged use.
