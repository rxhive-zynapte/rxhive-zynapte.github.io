## **Usage**

Camylofin + Mefenamic Acid is prescribed for the relief of abdominal pain associated with conditions like intestinal colic, biliary colic, renal colic, dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation), and pancreatitis.  It is also used to alleviate abdominal cramps linked with diarrhea.

It is classified pharmacologically as an antispasmodic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) combination.

Camylofin works by relaxing the smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal tract, reducing spasms and contractions. Mefenamic acid inhibits cyclooxygenase enzymes, reducing the production of prostaglandins, which are responsible for pain and inflammation.

## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination.  It is generally referred to by its constituent drug names.  Brand names vary depending on the region and manufacturer, and include Anafortan-MF and Bigspas-M.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Camylofin exerts its antispasmodic effect through a dual mechanism: as an anticholinergic agent by inhibiting acetylcholine binding to muscarinic receptors, and through direct smooth muscle relaxation by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type IV, leading to increased cyclic AMP and reduced cytosolic calcium. Mefenamic acid, an NSAID, inhibits cyclooxygenase enzymes, decreasing prostaglandin synthesis, thus reducing pain and inflammation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Both drugs are absorbed orally. Camylofin's metabolism and elimination pathways are not clearly defined. Mefenamic acid is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily through the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** Camylofin acts on smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal tract, reducing spasms and contractions. Mefenamic acid inhibits COX enzymes, leading to decreased prostaglandin production, thereby reducing pain and inflammation. No specific receptor binding or neurotransmitter modulation information is available for this combination.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Specific elimination pathways for Camylofin are not well-defined. Mefenamic acid is metabolized in the liver and primarily excreted renally.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The typical adult dose is one tablet containing 50 mg camylofin and 250 mg mefenamic acid, taken three times a day. The dosage may vary depending on the specific indication and patient response.  It should be taken with food or milk to minimize gastrointestinal side effects.

#### **Children:**

This medication is generally not recommended for children under 12 years of age.  For children over 12, the dosage should be determined by a physician, considering factors such as weight and the specific condition being treated.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Lower doses may be necessary due to increased risk of adverse effects. Close monitoring is recommended.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with renal impairment. Dose adjustments may be required.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution.  Dose adjustments may be required. Close monitoring of liver function is necessary.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with heart disease, hypertension, liver disease, kidney disease, or asthma.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  Dosages for these specific clinical use cases are not explicitly defined and should be determined by a physician based on individual patient needs.

* **Intubation**
* **Surgical Procedures**
* **Mechanical Ventilation**
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
