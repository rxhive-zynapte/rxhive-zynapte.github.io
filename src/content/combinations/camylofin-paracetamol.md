## **Usage**

Camylofin + Paracetamol is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of abdominal pain and cramps, particularly those arising from spasms in the gastrointestinal, biliary, renal, and urinary tracts. It is also indicated for dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation).

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Camylofin: Antispasmodic, Anticholinergic
* Paracetamol: Analgesic, Antipyretic

**Mechanism of Action:**

Camylofin acts as an antispasmodic by relaxing the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal, biliary, urinary, and renal tracts.  It has a dual mechanism, directly relaxing smooth muscle (musculotropic) and inhibiting acetylcholine's action (neurotropic). Paracetamol provides pain relief and fever reduction by centrally inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways, affecting pain signal processing and thermoregulation.  Together, they provide synergistic relief from pain and spasms.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Camylofin + Paracetamol" is the standard generic name, the combination is marketed under various brand names, including Anafortan, Anacred, Camyfyl, and Anapolis Syrup.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* Camylofin: Relaxes smooth muscle via a dual mechanism, reducing spasms and associated pain. It predominantly acts as a musculotropic agent, inhibiting phosphodiesterase IV, increasing cyclic AMP levels, and promoting smooth muscle relaxation by depleting intracellular calcium.  It also has a milder neurotropic, anticholinergic effect, blocking acetylcholine binding to muscarinic receptors.  
* Paracetamol:  Exerts analgesic and antipyretic effects centrally by inhibiting COX pathways, thus modulating pain perception and thermoregulation in the hypothalamus. Its peripheral COX inhibition is minimal.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* Camylofin: Data on its specific pharmacokinetic parameters (absorption, metabolism, and elimination) is limited.
* Paracetamol: Well-absorbed orally, extensively metabolized in the liver (primarily via glucuronidation and sulfation), with a small portion undergoing CYP450-mediated metabolism to a reactive metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI is detoxified by glutathione but can accumulate in cases of overdose, leading to hepatotoxicity.  Eliminated primarily in the urine as metabolites.

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**

* Camylofin: Inhibits phosphodiesterase IV, muscarinic receptor antagonist.
* Paracetamol: COX inhibitor.

**Elimination pathways:**

* Camylofin: Limited data available.
* Paracetamol: Primarily renal excretion of metabolites, with a minor portion excreted unchanged in the urine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The typical adult dose is one tablet containing 50 mg of Camylofin and 325-500 mg of Paracetamol, taken thrice daily. The maximum daily dose of Paracetamol should not exceed 4 grams. 

#### **Children:**

The safety and efficacy in children under 6 years of age have not been fully established.  Dosing in older children should be carefully determined based on the child's weight and the specific formulation (syrup or suspension).  Refer to the following section based on available data:  For children aged 6-12 years, Anapolis syrup (Camylofin 12.5 mg + Paracetamol 125mg/5ml) is commonly prescribed at 5-10 ml two to three times daily for a maximum of 5 days.  For other formulations, always follow a physician's advice and calculate the Paracetamol component based on the child's weight (15mg/kg/dose, max 1g/dose, max 4 doses/24 hrs, max 4g/24 hrs)

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution.  Dosage adjustments may be required based on renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution.  Dose adjustment is recommended based on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution, especially in severe liver disease.  Reduce the dose or avoid use altogether in severe liver dysfunction.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, urinary retention, myasthenia gravis, pyloric or other mechanical stenoses, paralytic ileus, and porphyria.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing for specific clinical situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations should be determined on a case-by-case basis by the treating physician. No standard recommendations are available for these specific clinical settings for this drug combination.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are necessary based on individual patient factors like renal/hepatic impairment, pre-existing conditions, concomitant medications, age, and body weight (especially below 50kg). Close monitoring is essential, particularly in the elderly.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Drowsiness, headache, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, constipation, dizziness, blurred vision, skin rash, increased heart rate.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (e.g., skin rash, itching, facial swelling, difficulty breathing), liver damage (with Paracetamol overdose), blood disorders (anemia, neutropenia), QT interval prolongation (rare).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Potential long-term side effects are not well-documented. Chronic high doses of Paracetamol can contribute to renal impairment.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (rare), toxic epidermal necrolysis (rare), acute liver failure (with Paracetamol overdose).

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to Camylofin or Paracetamol, severe liver disease, gastrointestinal bleeding,  glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, paralytic ileus, pyloric stenosis, prostatic hypertrophy with urinary retention, porphyria,  mechanical stenoses, urinary retention, tachycardia.

## **Drug Interactions**

Anticholinergics (e.g., atropine, scopolamine), cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., neostigmine, pyridostigmine), alcohol,  medications metabolized by CYP450 enzymes,  anticoagulants, antihypertensives.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy:**  Use with caution.  Consult a physician before use. While Paracetamol is generally considered safe, Camylofin's safety in pregnancy is less established. 

**Breastfeeding:**  Avoid unless considered essential by the physician. Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk, and Camylofin's effects on infants are not well-studied.
