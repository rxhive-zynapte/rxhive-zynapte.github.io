## **Usage**

Canagliflozin + Metformin is prescribed as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is also indicated to reduce the risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), doubling of serum creatinine, cardiovascular (CV) death, and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and diabetic nephropathy with albuminuria >300 mg/day.  It is not indicated for type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.

It belongs to the pharmacological classes of:
* **Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor** (Canagliflozin)
* **Biguanide** (Metformin)


Canagliflozin works by inhibiting SGLT2 in the kidneys, thereby increasing glucose excretion in urine and lowering blood glucose levels. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.

## **Alternate Names**

Canagliflozin + Metformin is available as fixed-dose combinations under various brand names, including Invokamet and Invokamet XR.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Canagliflozin increases urinary glucose excretion.  Metformin reduces hepatic glucose production, increases peripheral glucose uptake, and decreases intestinal glucose absorption. The combination leads to improved glycemic control.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:** Both drugs are orally administered and absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Food may delay and slightly reduce canagliflozin absorption. Metformin's absorption can be affected by gastrointestinal motility.
* **Metabolism:** Canagliflozin is primarily metabolized via glucuronidation by UGT enzymes (mainly UGT1A9 and UGT2B4), with minor oxidative metabolism by CYP3A4 (less than 7%). Metformin is not hepatically metabolized.
* **Elimination:** Canagliflozin is primarily excreted in urine (42%) and feces (33%). Metformin is eliminated primarily through renal excretion as the unchanged drug with negligible metabolism.

**Mode of Action:** Canagliflozin inhibits SGLT2, the main transporter of glucose in the renal proximal tubules, preventing glucose reabsorption into the bloodstream. Metformin's exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which regulates multiple metabolic pathways. This leads to a decrease in gluconeogenesis and increase in insulin sensitivity.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Canagliflozin selectively inhibits SGLT2 receptors. Metformin activates AMPK.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Canagliflozin undergoes renal and hepatic excretion. Metformin is eliminated by renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
* **Invokamet (immediate-release):** Initial dose is typically canagliflozin 50 mg/metformin 500 mg twice daily with meals.  The dose may be increased based on efficacy and tolerability to a maximum of canagliflozin 300 mg and metformin 2000 mg per day.
* **Invokamet XR (extended-release):** Initial dose is usually canagliflozin 100 mg/metformin 1000 mg once daily with the morning meal. This may be increased to a maximum of canagliflozin 300 mg/metformin 2000 mg daily based on individual response.

#### **Children:**  Not recommended for patients under 18 years of age.


#### **Special Cases:**
* **Elderly Patients:** Initiate with lower doses and monitor renal function closely. Dose adjustment may be required.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Contraindicated if eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m².  Dose reductions are necessary for patients with eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m².
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Dose adjustments may be required. Patients with heart failure are at higher risk for adverse events.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Canagliflozin + Metformin is not indicated for use in intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustment may be required based on eGFR, concomitant UGT enzyme inducers, and individual tolerability.
