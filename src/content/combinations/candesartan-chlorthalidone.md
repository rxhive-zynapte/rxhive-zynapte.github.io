## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Candesartan + Chlorthalidone is prescribed for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure).  It is used when treatment with a single agent is not sufficient to control blood pressure.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination drug falls under the classification of antihypertensives. It combines an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) with a thiazide diuretic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Candesartan blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels, leading to vasodilation and a decrease in blood pressure. Chlorthalidone increases the excretion of sodium and water from the body by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron, further lowering blood pressure through diuresis.

## **Alternate Names**

-  Candesartan cilexetil + Hydrochlorothiazide
- **Brand Names:** Atacand HCT



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Candesartan exerts its antihypertensive effect by selectively blocking the AT1 subtype of angiotensin II receptors,  leading to vasodilation and reduced aldosterone secretion. Chlorthalidone increases the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water, leading to a decrease in blood volume and peripheral vascular resistance.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Candesartan is orally administered and metabolized in the liver to its active form, candesartan cilexetil.  It is then excreted primarily via bile and feces. Chlorthalidone is well-absorbed orally and exhibits a prolonged half-life, allowing for once-daily dosing. It is excreted unchanged by the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:** At the molecular level, candesartan competitively binds to the AT1 receptor, preventing angiotensin II from binding and initiating its vasoconstricting effects. Chlorthalidone inhibits the sodium-chloride symporter in the distal convoluted tubule, preventing sodium reabsorption.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Candesartan is primarily eliminated via biliary/fecal excretion, while chlorthalidone is eliminated renally.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**  
#### **Adults:**  
- The initial dose is typically 16 mg candesartan and 12.5 mg chlorthalidone once daily.  The dosage may be increased up to 32 mg candesartan and 25 mg chlorthalidone once daily if needed.

#### **Children:**  
-  Not typically recommended for pediatric use.


#### **Special Cases:**  
- **Elderly Patients** – Start at a lower dose (e.g. 8 mg candesartan/ 12.5 mg chlorthalidone), and titrate cautiously as needed.  Monitor renal function closely.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment** –  For moderate to severe renal impairment,  a lower starting dose is recommended.  Close monitoring of renal function is essential.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction** – For moderate hepatic impairment, a lower starting dose may be considered. Use with caution in severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions** – Close monitoring is recommended in patients with heart failure, diabetes, or other comorbid conditions. Electrolyte levels should be monitored, especially potassium.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  
- **Intubation:** Not specifically indicated.
- **Surgical Procedures:**  May need to be withheld or adjusted depending on the procedure and patient status.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** No specific dosage adjustments.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Dosage adjustments may be required based on patient status and renal function.
- **Emergency Situations:** Not the preferred agent for acute management of hypertension.


### **Dosage Adjustments**  
- Dose adjustments should be made based on individual patient response and tolerability. Close monitoring of blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes is important.

## **Side Effects**

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** D (positive evidence of fetal risk) / X
-  Candesartan is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of fetal harm.  
- Chlorthalidone is also not recommended.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Candesartan and chlorthalidone pass into breast milk.  Alternate antihypertensives should be considered.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Often used alone as a two-drug combination.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Monitor renal function and electrolytes.  Assess for volume depletion.
