      **A:**  Temporarily discontinue the medication.  Assess volume status and
      electrolytes. Consider resuming at a lower dose once stabilized.  If
      hypotension persists, alternative antihypertensive therapy may be
      necessary.

      an appropriate dose for the individual patient.  A lower starting dose of
      candesartan might be considered, especially in patients at risk for
      hypotension.  Closely monitor blood pressure response.

## **Usage**

Candesartan + Hydrochlorothiazide is prescribed for the treatment of essential hypertension (high blood pressure) in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by monotherapy with either drug alone. It can also be used as a replacement therapy for patients already titrated on candesartan and hydrochlorothiazide.  It is not indicated as initial therapy. It can be used to treat patients with hypertension who are not volume depleted.

It is also used in some cases to manage heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) when other treatments are not tolerated or not adequate, though candesartan monotherapy is preferred.


- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antihypertensive, Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB) combined with a Thiazide diuretic.

- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination therapy addresses hypertension through two distinct mechanisms: 
    - **Candesartan:**  Blocks the angiotensin II receptor, preventing vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion, thus lowering blood pressure.
    - **Hydrochlorothiazide:** Increases the excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys, reducing blood volume and further lowering blood pressure.



## **Alternate Names**

- **International and Regional Variations:** Candesartan cilexetil/hydrochlorothiazide is a common alternative name.

- **Brand Names:** Atacand HCT, PrAPO-CANDESARTAN/HCTZ, and various generic formulations are available.



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**
    - Candesartan acts as an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, blocking the vasoconstricting and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. This leads to vasodilation, reduced sodium and water retention, and a decrease in blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney, increasing the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water.  This diuresis contributes to the overall reduction in blood pressure.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Candesartan cilexetil, the prodrug of candesartan, is well absorbed orally and rapidly converted to candesartan in the gastrointestinal tract. Hydrochlorothiazide is also readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The presence of food does not significantly affect the absorption of either medication.
    - **Metabolism:** Candesartan is minimally metabolized by the liver. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized.
    - **Elimination:** Candesartan is primarily eliminated unchanged in both the urine and feces. Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated primarily unchanged through renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** Candesartan competitively binds to the AT1 subtype of the angiotensin II receptor, preventing the binding of angiotensin II. Hydrochlorothiazide inhibits the sodium-chloride symporter in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney, leading to increased excretion of sodium, chloride, and water in the urine. This increases urinary output and further reduces blood volume and pressure.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Candesartan specifically blocks the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1 receptor). Hydrochlorothiazide affects sodium reabsorption in the kidneys. Neither drug significantly interferes with neurotransmitter function or inhibits enzymes involved in drug metabolism (such as CYP450).
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Candesartan is eliminated through biliary (feces) and renal (urine) excretion. Hydrochlorothiazide is excreted primarily unchanged through renal excretion.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose:  Candesartan 16 mg/Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg once daily.
- The dosage may be increased by titrating either component of Candesartan/HCTZ depending on patient response and needs.  Maximal dose 32 mg/25mg once daily.
- The maximum antihypertensive effect is generally achieved within 4 weeks.



#### **Children:**

Use in children is not recommended as safety and efficacy have not been established.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No initial dose adjustment is necessary; however, initiate therapy with caution, and careful monitoring for hypotension is warranted.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** For mild to moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30-80 mL/min), dose titration of candesartan is recommended. Start with candesartan 4 mg and adjust as needed. Candesartan/HCTZ is contraindicated in severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min).
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** For mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A), no initial dose adjustment is necessary.  For moderate impairment (Child-Pugh B), initiate candesartan at a lower dose (e.g., 8 mg) and titrate as needed.  The fixed-dose combination is not recommended in this group initially, as appropriate lower candesartan starting doses are unavailable in this form. Candesartan/HCTZ is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring is needed for patients with diabetes, heart failure, or other cardiovascular diseases due to increased risk of adverse effects like hypotension, hyperkalemia, or worsening renal function.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Candesartan/HCTZ is not indicated for the specific acute scenarios listed below (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, emergency situations). Other short-acting antihypertensive drugs that allow easier titration and more rapid response are generally preferred in these settings.




### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient responses and tolerance.  Renal and hepatic function should be assessed before and during therapy. Concurrent medications can also influence dosage adjustments.
