## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Capecitabine + Cyclophosphamide is prescribed as first-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer (MBC), particularly in patients unsuitable for anthracycline or taxane-based therapies or those pretreated with these agents. It is also used to treat advanced and metastatic colorectal cancer and stage III colon cancer.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**  This combination comprises an antimetabolite (Capecitabine) and an alkylating agent (Cyclophosphamide), both classified as antineoplastic or anticancer medications.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Capecitabine, a prodrug, is metabolized to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which disrupts DNA and RNA synthesis, inhibiting cell growth. Cyclophosphamide alkylates DNA, cross-linking DNA strands and preventing cell division. The combined action of these drugs synergistically inhibits cancer cell proliferation.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names for the combination exist.

- **Brand Name:**  Comcapsy® (marketed by Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd, specifically designed as a fixed-dose combination tablet).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Capecitabine is converted to 5-FU preferentially in tumor tissues due to higher thymidine phosphorylase levels. 5-FU inhibits thymidylate synthase, a key enzyme in DNA synthesis, inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Cyclophosphamide, after metabolic activation, forms DNA cross-links, preventing DNA replication and transcription, ultimately leading to cell death.


- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Capecitabine is orally administered and well-absorbed. Its conversion to 5-FU occurs in three enzymatic steps, the final step occurring predominantly in tumor cells. Cyclophosphamide is also administered orally. Both drugs are metabolized in the liver. The primary elimination route for Capecitabine and its metabolites is renal excretion, while Cyclophosphamide metabolites are also renally cleared.

- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** 5-FU inhibits thymidylate synthase.  Cyclophosphamide metabolites bind to DNA, forming interstrand and intrastrand cross-links.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for both drugs.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The recommended dose for metastatic breast cancer is Capecitabine 829 mg/m² + Cyclophosphamide 33 mg/m² twice daily on days 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle.  A fixed-dose combination of Capecitabine 1800 mg + Cyclophosphamide 80 mg daily for 14 days of a 21-day cycle has also shown efficacy. Dosage adjustments are often required based on tolerability and individual patient factors.

#### **Children:**

- Use in pediatric patients is not well-established. Limited data suggests that Cyclophosphamide dosing for malignant disease in children is 40 to 50 mg/kg intravenously in divided doses over 2 to 5 days, or alternative regimens. Capecitabine use in children is generally avoided. Pediatric dosing should be guided by expert oncologists specializing in pediatric cancers.



#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Starting doses may need to be lower, considering age-related changes in organ function and drug clearance. Close monitoring for adverse events is crucial.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are required for patients with renal impairment.  Consult renal dosing guidelines and consider alternative fluorouracil-containing regimens for severe renal dysfunction.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction may be required depending on the severity of liver dysfunction.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Comorbidities like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and prior heart conditions require cautious consideration and potential dose adjustments. Close monitoring is essential.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

- This drug combination is specifically used in the setting of metastatic breast cancer and certain gastrointestinal cancers. The use of Capecitabine + Cyclophosphamide is not indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.
