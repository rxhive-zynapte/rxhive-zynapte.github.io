## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** This combination medication is prescribed for the topical relief of neuropathic pain, such as that caused by diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia (shingles), and spinal cord injuries. It may also be used for musculoskeletal pain, such as joint, neck, back, and muscle pain.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Analgesic, topical rubefacient, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), anticonvulsant.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination targets multiple pain pathways. Capsaicin depletes substance P, a neurotransmitter involved in pain transmission. Gabapentin modulates calcium channels in nerve cells and neurotransmitter release. Ketoprofen inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, reducing inflammation and pain. Methyl salicylate acts as a counterirritant, creating a warming sensation that distracts from pain.

## **Alternate Names**
This medication is a combination of four generic drugs. It does not have a specific international nonproprietary name. It is known by various brand names depending on the manufacturer.


- **Brand Names:** Deep Senz, Femgesic Plus, Arigaba, Gabatrix, and others.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Capsaicin desensitizes nociceptors (pain receptors). Gabapentin modifies nerve signaling, likely via voltage-gated calcium channels. Ketoprofen inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin production. Methyl salicylate causes vasodilation, creating a sensation of warmth.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** This is a topical medication with limited systemic absorption. The extent of absorption depends on the specific formulation (cream, ointment, gel) and the application site. Metabolism and elimination information for each individual component are as follows:
    - **Capsaicin:** Metabolized in the liver, excreted in urine and feces.
    - **Gabapentin:** Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.
    - **Ketoprofen:** Metabolized in the liver, excreted in urine.
    - **Methyl Salicylate:** Metabolized to salicylic acid, excreted in urine.


- **Mode of Action:** Capsaicin depletes substance P, a neurotransmitter involved in pain transmission. Gabapentin acts on the alpha-2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, modulating neurotransmitter release. Ketoprofen inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis. Methyl salicylate activates TRPV1 receptors, creating a warming sensation.

- **Elimination Pathways:** See Pharmacokinetics above.
