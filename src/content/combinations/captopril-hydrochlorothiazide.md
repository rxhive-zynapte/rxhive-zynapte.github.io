## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Captopril + Hydrochlorothiazide is prescribed for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure).  It is used when treatment with either drug alone does not adequately control blood pressure.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Combined Antihypertensive; ACE inhibitor/Thiazide diuretic combination.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination medication lowers blood pressure through two distinct mechanisms. Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, prevents the formation of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. This leads to vasodilation and reduced blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, increases the excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys, reducing blood volume and further lowering blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

- Capozide (brand name)
- Captopril/hydrochlorothiazide

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Captopril inhibits ACE, reducing angiotensin II formation, leading to vasodilation, decreased aldosterone secretion, and reduced peripheral vascular resistance. Hydrochlorothiazide inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron, promoting diuresis and reducing blood volume.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Captopril is rapidly absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1 hour. It is primarily excreted by the kidneys. Hydrochlorothiazide is also well-absorbed orally and is excreted unchanged by the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:** Captopril competitively binds to and inhibits ACE, preventing the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Hydrochlorothiazide inhibits the sodium-chloride cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule, impairing sodium reabsorption and increasing water excretion.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Both captopril and hydrochlorothiazide are primarily eliminated through renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: 25 mg captopril/15 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily, taken 1 hour before meals.
- Maintenance dose: 50 mg captopril/25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily.
- Maximum dose:  150 mg captopril/50 mg hydrochlorothiazide per day.
- Dosage adjustments should be made at intervals of 6-8 weeks, based on the patient's response.

#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy not established for use in children. There is no current recommendation to use this drug for patients under 18 years of age.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose (e.g., 25mg captopril/12.5mg hydrochlorothiazide) and titrate cautiously.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  For mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-80 mL/min), start with 25 mg captopril/12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily. Contraindicated in severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min).
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dose adjustment may be necessary. Contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** For patients with diabetes, avoid concomitant use with aliskiren.  For other comorbid conditions like congestive heart failure, monitor closely for hypotension and electrolyte imbalances.

### **Clinical Use Cases**
