## **Usage**

- This combination is primarily prescribed for the temporary relief of burning, irritation, and discomfort due to dry eye syndrome. It can also provide relief from dryness caused by wind or sun exposure.  Additionally, some studies suggest potential benefits in slowing the progression of cataracts.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Ophthalmic demulcents and lubricants.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Carboxymethylcellulose acts as a lubricant, increasing tear film viscosity and reducing evaporation. Glycerin is a humectant, drawing water to the ocular surface to enhance moisture retention. N-acetylcarnosine functions as an antioxidant, potentially protecting the lens from oxidative damage.

## **Alternate Names**

- Carboxymethylcellulose sodium + Glycerin + N-acetylcarnosine
- Artificial tears
- CMC + Glycerin + NAC
- **Brand Names:** Can-C™, C-Nac, Trotear Plus, Lubrinac, Boxycarb-Plus, Tear Bless Next

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Carboxymethylcellulose and glycerin lubricate and moisten the ocular surface, mimicking natural tears.  N-acetylcarnosine provides antioxidant protection against oxidative stress implicated in cataract formation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily topical application with minimal systemic absorption.  Information on metabolism and excretion is limited. Absorption of n-acetylcarnosine into the aqueous humor has been demonstrated.
- **Mode of Action:**  Carboxymethylcellulose increases tear film viscosity. Glycerin attracts water to the eye surface. N-acetylcarnosine scavenges free radicals. These combined actions alleviate dryness, irritation, and discomfort associated with dry eye.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Limited systemic absorption implies minimal involvement of renal/hepatic pathways.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- Instill 1 or 2 drops in the affected eye(s) four times daily, or as needed.
- For contact lens rewetting, instill 1 or 2 drops as needed, or place 1 or 2 drops on the lens before insertion.
