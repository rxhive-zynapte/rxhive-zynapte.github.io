## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the temporary relief of redness, burning, itching, and discomfort caused by minor eye irritations, such as allergic conjunctivitis (eye allergy) and dry eye syndrome. It also helps alleviate discomfort related to environmental factors like wind, sun, smoke, smog, chlorine (in swimming pools), and allergens (e.g., pollen, ragweed, grass, animal hair, and dander).  Its pharmacological classifications include:

* **Decongestant:** Naphazoline and phenylephrine constrict blood vessels in the eye.
* **Lubricant:** Carboxymethylcellulose moisturizes the eye surface.

The mechanism of action involves vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) and lubrication.  Naphazoline and phenylephrine activate alpha-adrenergic receptors in the eye's blood vessels, leading to vasoconstriction, which reduces redness and swelling. Carboxymethylcellulose creates a protective, lubricating layer on the ocular surface, relieving dryness and discomfort.

## **Alternate Names**

No internationally recognized non-proprietary name exists for this specific combination. It is generally referred to by its component ingredients. Brand names vary regionally. Some examples include:

* **Ocurest Plus Eye Drops**
* **Briscool Eye Drops**
* **Riblink Eye Drops**
* **Neored Eye Drop**
* **Mahakool Eye Drops**


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Naphazoline and phenylephrine, as sympathomimetic amines, stimulate alpha-adrenergic receptors on the vascular smooth muscle of the conjunctiva, causing vasoconstriction. This reduces ocular redness and swelling. Phenylephrine can also cause mild pupil dilation (mydriasis). Carboxymethylcellulose, a lubricant, coats the ocular surface providing a soothing effect and relieving dryness. Camphor and menthol (when present in some formulations) produce a cooling sensation.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Naphazoline and phenylephrine are primarily absorbed locally in the eye. Systemic absorption can occur, though it is usually minimal with topical application.  Information about the specific metabolic pathways and elimination routes of these drugs when administered ophthalmically is limited.  Carboxymethylcellulose, not being systemically absorbed, is eliminated through tear drainage.

**Mode of Action:**  Naphazoline and phenylephrine bind to alpha-adrenergic receptors on the vascular smooth muscle cells in the conjunctiva, mimicking the effects of the sympathetic nervous system.  This interaction triggers a signaling cascade that leads to smooth muscle contraction and vasoconstriction.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily through tear drainage and minimal systemic absorption followed by hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Instill 1-2 drops in the affected eye(s) every 3-4 hours as needed.  Do not exceed the recommended dosage or use for more than 72 hours without consulting a physician due to the risk of rebound congestion.

#### **Children:**  This combination is generally not recommended for children under 6 years of age. For children 6 years and older, the dosage should be determined and supervised by a physician.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution due to potential systemic effects, especially in individuals with cardiovascular disease or hypertension. Dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, narrow-angle glaucoma, or prostatic enlargement. Dose adjustment might be required.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is typically not used in the clinical settings of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU. It is primarily indicated for the relief of minor eye irritations. In emergency situations, it has no role.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments should be made on a case-by-case basis under the guidance of a physician, taking into account the patient's age, medical history, and concurrent medications.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Temporary burning or stinging sensation in the eyes
* Blurred vision
* Eye irritation
* Eye pain
* Photophobia (sensitivity to light)
* Dilated pupils

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Sweating
* Drowsiness
* Weakness
* Nervousness
* Irregular heartbeat
* Worsening redness/itching/swelling in or around the eyes

### **Long-Term Effects**

Prolonged use (more than 72 hours) can lead to rebound congestion, where the redness and swelling worsen after the medication is discontinued.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs are rare but can include systemic effects such as increased heart rate, blood pressure, and palpitations, particularly in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions.


## **Contraindications**

* Narrow-angle glaucoma
* Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs):** Concurrent use is contraindicated due to the risk of severe hypertension.
* **Tricyclic antidepressants:** May enhance the pressor effects of phenylephrine.
* **Beta-blockers:** May lead to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, causing increased blood pressure and reflex bradycardia.
* **Antihypertensives:** May counteract the effects of antihypertensive medications.
* **Other decongestant eye drops:** Concurrent use may increase the risk of side effects.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.  Consult a physician before using this medication if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding.
