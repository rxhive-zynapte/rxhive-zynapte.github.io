## **Usage**

Carboxymethylcellulose + Oxychloro Complex is prescribed for the relief of dry eye symptoms, such as burning, stinging, irritation, and discomfort. It is also used to protect the eyes from further irritation or dryness caused by environmental factors like wind, sun, or prolonged computer use.  It is classified as an ophthalmic lubricant and preservative. The mechanism of action involves carboxymethylcellulose lubricating the ocular surface, mimicking the mucin layer of tears, and oxychloro complex acting as a preservative.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is often referred to as artificial tears. Some products containing this combination may use brand names like "Carbosol", "Add Tears", "Refresh Tears", "Locfresh", "Relub LC", "FloGel",  "ForLube", "New Softdrops 0.5", "Eqifresh Gel," among others.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Carboxymethylcellulose increases tear film viscosity and prolongs tear film break-up time, moisturizing and protecting the ocular surface. Oxychloro complex acts as a preservative, preventing bacterial growth in multi-dose eye drops.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Carboxymethylcellulose, applied topically as eye drops, exhibits negligible systemic absorption. Oxychloro complex, as a preservative in eye drops, also demonstrates minimal systemic absorption.  Therefore, data on metabolism and elimination are limited.

**Mode of Action:** Carboxymethylcellulose, a cellulose derivative, functions as a lubricant, adhering to the eye's surface and mimicking the mucin layer of natural tears. It creates a protective shield, hydrating and lubricating the cornea.  Oxychloro complex acts as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, preventing bacterial and fungal contamination in the eye drop solution.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Carboxymethylcellulose and oxychloro complex do not exhibit receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation activities. Their primary functions are lubrication and preservation, respectively.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Instill 1-2 drops in the affected eye(s) as needed, typically 4 times a day, or up to 8 times a day for severe dryness.

#### **Children:** Although clinical experience suggests safety and efficacy in children and adolescents, formal clinical trial data are limited. The adult dosage is generally recommended for pediatric use after consultation with a healthcare professional. For children under 6 years, consult a healthcare professional before use.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are usually necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustments are needed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustments are needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with severe allergies or hypersensitivity to eye products. Consult with a doctor for pre-existing severe eye conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The standard dosage (1-2 drops as needed) applies to various clinical settings, including:

- **Intubation:** Use as needed to maintain ocular moisture.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Use as needed before, during, or after procedures to protect the cornea.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Use as needed to prevent corneal drying.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Use regularly to maintain ocular moisture.
- **Emergency Situations:** Use as needed for ocular lubrication.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific dosage adjustments are indicated based on renal/hepatic function, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms.
