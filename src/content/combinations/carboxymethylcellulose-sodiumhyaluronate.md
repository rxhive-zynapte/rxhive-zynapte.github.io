## **Usage**

Carboxymethylcellulose + Sodium Hyaluronate is prescribed for the treatment of dry eye disease, a condition characterized by insufficient lubrication and moisture on the surface of the eye. This combination acts as an ocular lubricant, mimicking natural tears to alleviate symptoms such as burning, irritation, and discomfort.  It is classified as an ophthalmic demulcent and artificial tear. The mechanism of action involves the formation of a lubricating and moisturizing film over the cornea, providing a soothing effect and relieving dryness.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is often referred to as "artificial tears."  There are various brand names under which this drug combination, or similar formulations with varying concentrations, may be marketed, such as Optive Fusion and others. Regional variations of the names may exist.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Carboxymethylcellulose and sodium hyaluronate work synergistically to provide lubrication and hydration to the ocular surface. Sodium hyaluronate, a naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan found in the eye, exhibits viscoelastic properties, promoting healing and protecting against dehydration. Carboxymethylcellulose is a mucoadhesive polymer that adheres to the corneal epithelium, providing long-lasting lubrication. The combined effect results in increased tear film stability and reduced friction between the eyelid and the cornea.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Both carboxymethylcellulose and sodium hyaluronate are primarily locally acting agents, meaning they exert their effects directly on the ocular surface. Systemic absorption is minimal.  Elimination pathways are not well-characterized as systemic exposure is negligible.

**Mode of Action:** Carboxymethylcellulose interacts with corneal epithelial cells by binding to glucose receptors such as GLUT-1. This promotes cell attachment and migration, contributing to wound healing and mitigating irritation.  Sodium hyaluronate contributes to the viscoelasticity of the tear film, improving its stability and reducing evaporation. The combination does not involve receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation in the classical sense.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
Instill 1 or 2 drops in the affected eye(s) as needed, typically four to six times a day, or as directed by a physician.

#### **Children:**
Safety and efficacy in children under 6 have not been established. Use with caution and under medical supervision.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustments are typically necessary.
- **Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment:** No specific dose adjustments are needed.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage remains consistent across various clinical use cases including intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**
No specific dosage adjustments are required based on renal or hepatic dysfunction.



## **Side Effects**

- Temporary blurred vision
- Mild burning/stinging
- Eye irritation


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Severe allergic reactions (rash, itching/swelling, dizziness, trouble breathing)
- Eye pain
- Changes in vision
- Continued redness/irritation


### **Long-Term Effects**
No significant long-term effects have been reported.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Severe allergic reactions and any signs of infection or unusual ocular reactions should be promptly addressed.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to carboxymethylcellulose, sodium hyaluronate, or any component of the formulation.


## **Drug Interactions**

Limited information is available on drug interactions specific to this combination. It is advisable to maintain a gap of 5 minutes between instilling this combination and other ophthalmic medications. Concomitant use with benzalkonium chloride or cetylpyridinium-containing solutions should be avoided as they may interact negatively.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult a physician before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Although both components are generally considered safe, data specific to this combination during pregnancy and lactation are limited.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Lubricates and hydrates the ocular surface by forming a protective film, mimicking natural tears.
- **Side Effects:**  Blurred vision, burning/stinging, eye irritation (rarely, allergic reactions).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:**  Benzalkonium chloride, cetylpyridinium.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult a physician.
- **Dosage:** 1-2 drops in affected eye(s) as needed.
