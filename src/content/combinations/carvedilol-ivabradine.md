## **Usage**

Carvedilol + Ivabradine is prescribed as a substitution therapy in adult patients with normal sinus rhythm who are already stabilized on carvedilol and ivabradine taken concomitantly at the same doses. It's indicated for:

* **Symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris** in patients with coronary artery disease.
* **Treatment of chronic heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV)** with systolic dysfunction.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This combination drug falls under the following classifications:

* **Beta-blocker (carvedilol):** Carvedilol is a non-selective beta-blocker with alpha-1 blocking properties.
* **Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel blocker (ivabradine):** Ivabradine selectively inhibits the If current in the sinoatrial node, slowing the heart rate.

**Mechanism of Action:**

Carvedilol reduces peripheral vascular resistance through alpha-1 blockade and suppresses the renin-angiotensin system through beta-blockade.  Ivabradine works by selectively inhibiting the If current in the sinoatrial node, which slows the heart rate and reduces myocardial oxygen demand. The combination provides synergistic effects in managing angina and heart failure.


## **Alternate Names**

**International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Carvedilol/Ivabradine

**Brand Names:** Carivalan

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Carvedilol:** Reduces heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial contractility. It also improves myocardial oxygen supply/demand balance.
* **Ivabradine:**  Reduces heart rate without affecting myocardial contractility, blood pressure or ventricular repolarization.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Carvedilol:**  Well absorbed orally, extensively metabolized in the liver (primarily by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9), and excreted in bile and urine.
* **Ivabradine:** Well absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver and intestine (primarily by CYP3A4), and excreted in urine and feces.

**Mode of Action:**

* **Carvedilol:** Blocks beta-adrenergic receptors and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors.
* **Ivabradine:** Selectively inhibits the  If current in the sinoatrial node, slowing diastolic depolarization.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**

* **Carvedilol:** Beta-1, Beta-2, and Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker.
* **Ivabradine:** HCN channel blocker.

**Elimination Pathways:**

* **Carvedilol:** Primarily hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion, some renal excretion.
* **Ivabradine:** Hepatic and intestinal metabolism (CYP3A4), renal and fecal excretion.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The recommended dose of Carvedilol + Ivabradine is one tablet twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening, with food.  It's crucial that patients are already stabilized on individual components at their optimal doses before switching to the fixed-dose combination.


#### **Children:**

Carvedilol + Ivabradine is not recommended for use in children.



#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  For patients aged 75 or older, a lower starting dose of ivabradine (2.5mg twice daily) as a separate component should be considered before up-titration if necessary. Carvedilol dose adjustments may be required based on renal function and response.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No dose adjustment is required for ivabradine for patients with creatinine clearance above 15 mL/min. Ivabradine should be used with caution in patients with creatinine clearance below 15 mL/min. Carvedilol dose should be reduced in patients with severe renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Carvedilol + Ivabradine is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Carvedilol should be used with caution in mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  Ivabradine dosage should be reduced in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dose adjustment may be necessary for patients with diabetes, other cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory conditions.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Carvedilol + Ivabradine is not typically used in acute clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or emergency situations. Its primary use is for chronic stable angina pectoris and chronic heart failure.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on heart rate, blood pressure, and individual patient tolerance. If heart rate falls below 50 bpm at rest, or if the patient experiences symptoms of bradycardia (e.g., dizziness, fatigue, hypotension), down-titration of the individual components is necessary. Any dosage adjustments should be made with the individual components (carvedilol and ivabradine), not the fixed combination pill.

## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects**

Dizziness, headache, fatigue, bradycardia, visual disturbances (phosphenes), low blood pressure, diarrhea.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Severe bradycardia, symptomatic hypotension, worsening heart failure,  atrioventricular block, sick sinus syndrome.


### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential long-term effects include worsening of pre-existing heart conditions if not adequately monitored.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Angioedema, severe allergic reactions, acute heart failure exacerbation.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to carvedilol, ivabradine, or any component of the formulation.
* Severe hepatic impairment.
* Acute or unstable/decompensated heart failure.
* Unstable angina.
* Prinzmetal's angina.
* Second or third-degree atrioventricular block.
* Sick sinus syndrome.
* Symptomatic bradycardia (<50 bpm).
* Cardiogenic shock.
* Pacemaker dependence.
* Severe peripheral vascular disease.
* Severe hypotension.
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with bronchial obstruction.
* Bronchospasm or asthma.
* Metabolic acidosis.
* Untreated pheochromocytoma.
* Concomitant use with verapamil, diltiazem, or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding.

## **Drug Interactions**

Carvedilol and ivabradine are both metabolized by hepatic enzymes, making them prone to drug interactions.  Clinically significant interactions can occur with:

* **CYP3A4 Inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin):**  Can increase ivabradine levels, leading to severe bradycardia.
* **CYP3A4 Inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's Wort):** Can decrease ivabradine levels, reducing its efficacy.
* **Calcium Channel Blockers (e.g., verapamil, diltiazem):** Can exacerbate bradycardia.
* **Digoxin:**  Can enhance bradycardic effects.
* **Other Beta-Blockers:**  Additive effects on heart rate and blood pressure.




## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Carvedilol + Ivabradine is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential risks to the fetus and neonate. Carvedilol is classified as Pregnancy Category C, and ivabradine is contraindicated in pregnancy.  Both drugs can be excreted in breast milk.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
