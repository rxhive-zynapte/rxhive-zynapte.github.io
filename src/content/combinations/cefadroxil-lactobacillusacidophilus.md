## **Usage**

Cefadroxil is a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections affecting various body parts, including urinary tract infections (UTIs), skin and skin structure infections, pharyngitis, and tonsillitis.  Lactobacillus acidophilus is a probiotic, a beneficial bacterium that helps maintain a healthy balance of gut flora.  The combination of cefadroxil and Lactobacillus acidophilus is primarily prescribed to treat bacterial infections while mitigating potential disruptions to the gut microbiota caused by antibiotic use.  

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Cefadroxil: Antibiotic (Cephalosporin)
* Lactobacillus acidophilus: Probiotic

**Mechanism of Action:**

Cefadroxil exerts its antibacterial effect by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death.  Lactobacillus acidophilus works by competing with pathogenic bacteria for resources and adhesion sites in the gut, promoting a balanced gut microbiome.

## **Alternate Names**

Cefadroxil is also known as Duricef and Ultracef (brand names). Lactobacillus acidophilus is often referred to as L. acidophilus. There aren't widely recognized alternate names for the combination product itself. Brand names may vary regionally.

## **How It Works**

**Cefadroxil:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Cefadroxil inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), ultimately causing cell lysis and death.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Cefadroxil is well-absorbed orally.  It is minimally metabolized in the liver and primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.

**Lactobacillus acidophilus:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:**  Produces lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and other substances that create an environment hostile to many pathogenic bacteria. It also competes with harmful bacteria for nutrients and binding sites in the gut. It may also modulate immune responses.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Administered orally; it colonizes the gastrointestinal tract, where it exerts its effects. It does not get significantly absorbed into the systemic circulation.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

**Note:**  As this combination is not standardized, the following is based on typical individual component dosing.  Always follow the specific product's instructions and consider consulting with a pharmacist or infectious disease specialist for personalized dosing advice. This information is believed to be current but is subject to change with emerging research and clinical guidelines.

#### **Adults:**

* **Cefadroxil:** 1-2 g/day orally in single or divided doses. 
* **Lactobacillus acidophilus:** 1-15 billion CFUs daily.

#### **Children:**

* **Cefadroxil:** 30 mg/kg/day orally in single or divided doses.
* **Lactobacillus acidophilus:**  Consult a pediatrician for appropriate pediatric dosing of probiotics.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary based on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Cefadroxil dose reduction is required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No major dose adjustments are typically needed for cefadroxil.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient factors and potential drug interactions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing for specific clinical situations is generally based on the infection being treated and is guided by standard cefadroxil dosing. Probiotics are adjunctive and not specifically dosed for these situations.

* **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use/Emergency Situations:**  Standard cefadroxil dosing adjusted for renal function.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Cefadroxil:  Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), rash.
* Lactobacillus acidophilus:  Gas, bloating.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Cefadroxil:  Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), *Clostridium difficile* - associated diarrhea.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

* Cefadroxil:  Serum sickness-like reaction, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (rare).


## **Contraindications**

* Cefadroxil: Hypersensitivity to cephalosporins.
* Lactobacillus acidophilus:  Individuals with severely compromised immune systems.


## **Drug Interactions**

* Cefadroxil: Probenecid may increase cefadroxil levels.
* Lactobacillus acidophilus:  May be affected by antibiotics. It's recommended to administer probiotics at least 2 hours before or after antibiotics.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* Cefadroxil:  Generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Consult a physician.
* Lactobacillus acidophilus:  Possibly safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Consult a physician.
