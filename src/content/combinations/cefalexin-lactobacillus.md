## Usage

Cefalexin is a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections. Lactobacillus, a probiotic, is sometimes used concurrently with antibiotics to help prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea. This combination is not a fixed-dose combination product; they are prescribed and administered separately.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Cefalexin: Antibiotic, first-generation cephalosporin
* Lactobacillus: Probiotic

**Mechanism of Action:**

* Cefalexin: Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins, leading to bacterial cell death.
* Lactobacillus:  Helps restore the balance of gut microbiota, which can be disrupted by antibiotics, reducing the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

## Alternate Names

**Cefalexin:** Ceporex, Keflex (brand name), Cephalexin Monohydrate

**Lactobacillus:** Various species exist (e.g., *Lactobacillus acidophilus*, *Lactobacillus rhamnosus*) and are often included in probiotic formulations under various brand names.


## How It Works

**Cefalexin:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Bactericidal action by disrupting bacterial cell wall synthesis.
* **Pharmacokinetics:**
    * Well-absorbed orally.
    * Primarily excreted unchanged in urine via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion.
    * Half-life is approximately 1 hour.
    * Food may slightly decrease the rate but not the extent of absorption.

**Lactobacillus:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Improves gut microbial balance, reduces inflammation, and enhances gut barrier function.
* **Pharmacokinetics:**
    * Not systematically absorbed.
    * Colonizes the gastrointestinal tract.

## Dosage

**Cefalexin:**

### Standard Dosage

#### Adults:

* 250-500 mg every 6-12 hours, depending on infection severity. 
* Maximum daily dose is 4g.
* Duration of therapy: 7-14 days, or as directed by a physician.

#### Children:

* 25-100 mg/kg/day, divided into 2-4 doses. 
* Dosage depends on age, weight, and infection severity.

#### Special Cases:

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary for those with renal impairment.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction based on creatinine clearance (CrCl). See below.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are generally needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments might be required. Consult a physician.

**Lactobacillus:**

Administered separately, as per the probiotic product's instructions. Dosage varies across formulations.

### Clinical Use Cases

Dosing for Cefalexin remains the same as standard dosing.  For surgical prophylaxis, a single dose may be administered before the procedure.


### Dosage Adjustments

**Cefalexin:**

* Renal Impairment:
    * CrCl â‰¥50 mL/min: No adjustment.
    * CrCl 30-59 mL/min: Maximum daily dose should not exceed 1g.
    * CrCl 15-29 mL/min: 250 mg every 8-12 hours.
    * CrCl 5-14 mL/min: 250 mg every 24 hours.
    * CrCl 1-4 mL/min: 250 mg every 24-60 hours. 
    * Hemodialysis: Administer dose after dialysis.

## Side Effects

**Cefalexin:**

### Common Side Effects

* Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, rash, pruritus, headache.

### Rare but Serious Side Effects:

* *Clostridium difficile* associated diarrhea, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, serum sickness-like reaction, anaphylaxis, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia.


## Contraindications

**Cefalexin:**

* Hypersensitivity to cephalosporins or penicillins.

## Drug Interactions

**Cefalexin:**

* Probenecid: Reduces renal excretion of cefalexin, increasing its serum levels.
* Oral contraceptives: Efficacy may be reduced. 
* Metformin: Cefalexin can increase metformin levels.

## Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

**Cefalexin:**

* Pregnancy Category B. Generally considered safe.
* Excreted in breast milk, monitor infant for diarrhea.

**Lactobacillus:** Generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

## Drug Profile Summary

Please refer to the sections above.

## Popular Combinations

Cefalexin is often used alone.  Concomitant use with Lactobacillus is not a standard "combination therapy", rather, it is supplemental to mitigate potential side effects of antibiotic usage. 

## Precautions
