## **Usage**

Cefalexin + Probenecid is a combination of a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic (Cefalexin) and a uricosuric agent (Probenecid). It is primarily used to treat bacterial infections susceptible to Cefalexin. Probenecid is included in this combination specifically to enhance the effects of Cefalexin.  This combination is indicated for respiratory tract infections (bronchitis, pneumonia, tonsillitis, pharyngitis), skin and soft tissue infections, bone and joint infections, urinary tract infections (cystitis and prostatitis), and dental infections.


## **Alternate Names**

While "Cefalexin + Probenecid" is the generic name, Cefalexin is also known as Cephalexin. Brand names for Cefalexin include Keflex, Biocef, Daxbia, and Keftab. Brand names containing Probenecid may also exist regionally.

## **How It Works**

**Cefalexin:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Cefalexin is bactericidal. It inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to and inactivating penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This disruption leads to cell lysis and bacterial death.

* **Pharmacokinetics:** Cefalexin is well-absorbed orally. It is minimally metabolized and primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Probenecid significantly impacts its pharmacokinetics by inhibiting its renal tubular secretion, resulting in higher and prolonged serum concentrations of Cefalexin.


**Probenecid:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Probenecid inhibits renal tubular secretion of certain organic anions, including Cefalexin and uric acid.

* **Pharmacokinetics:** Probenecid is well-absorbed after oral administration and undergoes hepatic metabolism, with metabolites and parent drug excreted in the urine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The typical adult dosage of Cefalexin is 1-4 g daily in divided doses.  The usual dose is 250 mg every 6 hours, or 500 mg every 8-12 hours. In severe infections, the dosage may be doubled. Probenecid dosage, when used as an adjunct, can vary depending on the specific clinical situation and is generally 500mg twice a day. It's crucial to consult specific product information for guidance.

#### **Children:**

The usual pediatric dosage of Cefalexin is 25-50 mg/kg/day, divided into doses given every 6-8 hours. For skin infections, strep throat, or uncomplicated UTIs, the daily dose can be given every 12 hours. Children under 5 years: 125 mg every 8 hours. Children 5 years and over: 250 mg every 8 hours. In severe infections, the dosage may be doubled.  Probenecid use in children requires careful assessment and specific dosing guidance beyond the scope of general recommendations. 

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be needed for patients with age-related renal impairment. Monitor renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Cefalexin dosage should be reduced based on creatinine clearance. Probenecid coadministration is generally not recommended in this population.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, although specific adjustments may not always be required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider potential drug interactions, particularly with Metformin in diabetic patients and anticoagulants like Warfarin.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosage of Cefalexin + Probenecid doesn't change dramatically in these settings. However, monitoring and potential dose adjustments based on renal function are essential, especially in critically ill patients. It's important to note that Probenecid primarily serves to increase Cefalexin's serum levels rather than directly addressing these clinical scenarios. Therefore, the focus is on managing the underlying condition and ensuring appropriate Cefalexin levels.

* **Intubation:** Standard dosage, adjusted for renal function.
* **Surgical Procedures:** Prophylactic use might be indicated; standard dosage adjusted for renal function.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** Standard dosage, adjusted for renal function.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Standard dosage, adjusted for renal function. Close monitoring for adverse effects.
* **Emergency Situations:** Standard dosage, adjusted for renal function.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are primarily based on renal function. Monitor serum creatinine and creatinine clearance, especially in elderly patients and those with pre-existing renal impairment.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Rash
* Headache


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis
* Serum sickness


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term use may lead to *C. difficile* infection, vitamin K deficiency (rare), and secondary infections.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Clinically significant ADRs include severe allergic reactions, *C. difficile* infection, and blood dyscrasias (rare).


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to cephalosporins or Probenecid
* Patients with a history of severe reactions to penicillins



## **Drug Interactions**

* **Probenecid:** Increases Cefalexin levels, raising the risk of side effects.
* **Metformin:** Cefalexin may decrease metformin clearance, requiring metformin dose adjustments.
* **Warfarin:** Cefalexin may enhance warfarin's anticoagulant effect. Monitor INR closely.
* **Other antibiotics (aminoglycosides, tetracyclines):**  Monitor for potential nephrotoxicity.
* **NSAIDS (ibuprofen, naproxen):** Potential interaction, monitor renal function.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Cefalexin is generally considered safe to use during pregnancy. However, benefits and risks should be carefully weighed.
* **Breastfeeding:** Both Cefalexin and Probenecid are excreted in breast milk in low concentrations. Monitor infants for diarrhea, candidiasis, and other potential side effects. Consider temporarily discontinuing breastfeeding or using an alternative antibiotic, if necessary.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Cefalexin: Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis. Probenecid: Inhibits renal tubular secretion.
* **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, rash, headache (common); *C. difficile* infection, allergic reactions (serious).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to cephalosporins or Probenecid.
* **Drug Interactions:** Probenecid, Metformin, Warfarin, aminoglycosides, NSAIDs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe, monitor for side effects in infants.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 1-4g daily. Children: 25-50mg/kg/day. Adjust for renal impairment.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, signs of infection, INR (if on Warfarin).

## **Popular Combinations** (generally not advised)

The combination of Cefalexin and Probenecid is itself considered the "combination" of focus. Co-administration with other drugs should be done cautiously, considering potential interactions mentioned above.



## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess renal function before and during treatment, especially in elderly patients and those with pre-existing kidney disease. Monitor for signs of allergic reactions and *C. difficile* infection.
* **Specific Populations:** See *Dosage - Special Cases*.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Alcohol may exacerbate certain side effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting). No specific restrictions on driving or diet are typically necessary, unless other co-administered drugs require them.
