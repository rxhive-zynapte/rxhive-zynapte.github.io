## **Usage**

Cefdinir is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic indicated for the treatment of various bacterial infections, including:

* **Community-Acquired Pneumonia:** Caused by susceptible strains of *Streptococcus pneumoniae* (penicillin-susceptible strains only), *Haemophilus influenzae* (including beta-lactamase-producing strains), *Haemophilus parainfluenzae* (including beta-lactamase-producing strains), or *Moraxella catarrhalis* (including beta-lactamase-producing strains).
* **Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis:** Caused by susceptible strains of *H. influenzae*, *H. parainfluenzae*, *S. pneumoniae*, or *M. catarrhalis*.
* **Acute Maxillary Sinusitis:** Caused by susceptible strains of *H. influenzae*, *S. pneumoniae*, or *M. catarrhalis*.
* **Pharyngitis and Tonsillitis:** Caused by *Streptococcus pyogenes*.
* **Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections:** Caused by susceptible strains of *Staphylococcus aureus* (including beta-lactamase-producing strains) or *S. pyogenes*.
* **Acute Otitis Media:**  Caused by susceptible strains of *S. pneumoniae*, *H. influenzae*, *M. catarrhalis*, or *S. pyogenes*.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Cefdinir is a beta-lactam antibiotic belonging to the cephalosporin class.

**Mechanism of Action:** Cefdinir inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to and inactivating penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).  This leads to cell lysis and bacterial death.


## **Alternate Names**

Cefdinir is also known as cefdinir hydrochloride.

**Brand Names:** Omnicef


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cefdinir exerts its bactericidal effect by disrupting the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls. This is achieved through binding to PBPs, essential enzymes for cell wall cross-linking.  The result is a weakened cell wall, ultimately causing bacterial cell lysis and death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Cefdinir is readily absorbed orally, with peak plasma concentrations occurring 2 to 4 hours after administration.  Food may slightly decrease the rate but not the extent of absorption.  The bioavailability of the capsule formulation is approximately 21%, while the suspension has an estimated bioavailability of 25%.
* **Distribution:** Cefdinir distributes widely into various tissues and fluids, including the lungs, sinuses, middle ear fluid, and skin.
* **Metabolism:** Cefdinir is minimally metabolized in the liver.
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys, with a half-life of approximately 1.7 hours.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* 300 mg every 12 hours or 600 mg once daily for 5 to 10 days for most infections.
* For uncomplicated skin infections, the recommended duration is 10 days.

#### **Children (6 months to 12 years):**

* 7 mg/kg every 12 hours or 14 mg/kg once daily, up to a maximum of 600 mg per day, for 5 to 10 days.
* Pediatric patients weighing â‰¥ 43 kg should receive the maximum daily dose of 600 mg.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are generally necessary unless renal function is impaired.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment is necessary:
    * Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) < 30 mL/min (adults): 300 mg once daily.
    * CrCl < 30 mL/min (children): 7 mg/kg once daily (up to 300 mg).
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment is required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments may be needed depending on the specific comorbidity.  Consult with a nephrologist if renal function is affected.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  Dosage information for specific clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations is not available for Cefdinir from the provided sources. Generally, antibiotic prophylaxis may be employed peri-operatively in certain surgical procedures to prevent surgical site infections, but the choice of antibiotic and dosage regimen depends on various factors such as the type of surgery, patient-specific risk factors, and local antibiogram.  Cefdinir is typically not indicated for such prophylactic use.

### **Dosage Adjustments**  Dosages should be modified based on CrCl as outlined above.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Abdominal pain
* Vaginal candidiasis
* Headache
* Dizziness


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea (CDAD)
* Allergic reactions (ranging from rash to anaphylaxis)
* Serum sickness-like reaction
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis
* Erythema multiforme
* Hepatic dysfunction
* Seizures (rare)


## **Contraindications**

* Known hypersensitivity to cefdinir or other cephalosporins.



## **Drug Interactions**

* **Antacids:** Concurrent administration with antacids containing aluminum or magnesium can reduce the absorption of cefdinir.
* **Iron Supplements:** Iron can reduce cefdinir absorption.
* **H2-Receptor Antagonists:** May decrease cefdinir levels.
* **Probenecid:** May increase cefdinir serum concentrations.
* **Oral Contraceptives:** Cefdinir may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Cefdinir is classified as Pregnancy Category B.  Use with caution during pregnancy and only if clearly needed.
* **Breastfeeding:** Cefdinir is excreted in breast milk. Caution is advised while breastfeeding.
