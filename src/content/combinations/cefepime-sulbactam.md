## **Usage**

Cefepime + Sulbactam is a fixed-dose combination antibiotic indicated for the treatment of various severe infections caused by susceptible pathogens.  These include:

* **Lower Respiratory Tract Infections (LRTIs):**  Nosocomial and community-acquired pneumonia.
* **Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs):** Complicated UTIs, including pyelonephritis.
* **Intra-abdominal Infections:** Complicated intra-abdominal infections, including peritonitis.
* **Septicemia:** Mild to moderate bacterial septicemia.
* **Skin and Skin Structure Infections.**
* **Acute Biliary Tract Infections** (in adults).

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Beta-lactam antibiotic (fourth-generation cephalosporin + beta-lactamase inhibitor).


**Mechanism of Action:** Cefepime exerts its bactericidal effect by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis through binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Sulbactam, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, protects cefepime from degradation by certain beta-lactamases produced by bacteria, thereby expanding its spectrum of activity.



## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names.


**Brand Names:**

* Quatam
* Supime
* Maxipime (Cefepime alone)

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cefepime + Sulbactam disrupts bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death.  Sulbactam enhances cefepime's activity against bacteria that produce beta-lactamases.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Cefepime is poorly absorbed orally and must be administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). Sulbactam is administered by IV.
* **Distribution:** Both drugs distribute widely into various tissues and body fluids.
* **Metabolism:** Cefepime undergoes minimal metabolism. Sulbactam is partially metabolized to inactive compounds.
* **Elimination:** Cefepime is primarily eliminated renally as unchanged drug.  Sulbactam is also mainly excreted in the urine via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion, with some biliary excretion.


**Mode of Action:** Cefepime inhibits transpeptidases and carboxypeptidases (PBPs) involved in peptidoglycan synthesis. Sulbactam irreversibly inhibits beta-lactamases, widening cefepime's spectrum.

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Cefepime binds to PBPs, and Sulbactam inhibits beta-lactamases. High doses of cefepime may cause neurotoxicity through GABA antagonism.

**Elimination pathways:**  Cefepime and Sulbactam are predominantly eliminated by renal excretion.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Standard Dose:** 1-2 g every 8-12 hours IV, infused over 30 minutes. Some literature suggests up to 6-9g of sulbactam daily for infections caused by multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs).
* **Maximum Dosage:** Up to 9 g daily.

#### **Children:**

* **Pediatric Dosing:** Children 2 months to 16 years and < 40 kg:  50 mg/kg every 8-12 hours IV for UTIs, uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, and pneumonia. Maximum dose: 2 g/dose. Consider renal function.  
* **Febrile neutropenia:** 50mg/kg every 8 hours.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Adjust dose based on creatinine clearance <60 mL/min.  Neurotoxicity risk is increased in elderly.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment necessary (see below).
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment generally required for Cefepime.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate patient-specific factors for dosage adjustments, especially in CKD.

### **Clinical Use Cases**


* **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:**  Follow standard adult dosing with renal adjustments and therapeutic drug monitoring as needed, especially for high doses.
* **Emergency Situations (Sepsis):** Initial dose may be higher (2 g every 8 hours) for severe infections or higher MIC organisms.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

* **Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustment is crucial. For adults, several regimens exist based on creatinine clearance (CrCl), infection severity, and desired dosing interval (see resources for specific examples).
*  Hemodialysis patients: 1g loading dose, then 0.5-1g every 24 hours, administered after dialysis.


## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
* Rash, itching
* Pain at injection site
* Headache

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Seizures

### **Long-Term Effects:**  Potential for renal dysfunction with prolonged use, especially at high doses and in patients with pre-existing renal impairment.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** Seizures, encephalopathy, *Clostridium difficile* associated diarrhea, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and anaphylaxis require immediate intervention.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to cefepime, sulbactam, or other cephalosporins.

* **Breastfeeding:** Cefepime is excreted in breast milk. Caution is advised; monitor infant for diarrhea and thrush.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, enhanced by beta-lactamase inhibition.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, seizures, encephalopathy.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to cephalosporins or sulbactam.
* **Drug Interactions:** Aminoglycosides, probenecid, anticoagulants.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution in pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:**  Adults: 1-2 g every 8-12 hours IV. Children: 50 mg/kg every 8-12 hours IV.  Renal dose adjustments necessary.

## **Popular Combinations**

Combination with metronidazole is used in intra-abdominal infections.



## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess renal function, monitor for neurologic signs, evaluate for drug allergies.
* **Specific Populations:** Use with caution in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Adjust dose in renal impairment and elderly patients. Monitor neonates exposed via breastfeeding.
