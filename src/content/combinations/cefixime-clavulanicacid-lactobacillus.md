## **Usage**

Cefixime + Clavulanic Acid + Lactobacillus is a combination drug primarily used for the treatment of various bacterial infections, especially those affecting the respiratory and urinary tracts.  Lactobacillus is included to mitigate gastrointestinal side effects commonly associated with antibiotic use.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic (Cefixime and Clavulanic Acid), Probiotic (Lactobacillus)
- **Mechanism of Action:** Cefixime, a third-generation cephalosporin, inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).  Clavulanic acid, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, enhances Cefixime's activity by preventing its degradation by bacterial enzymes.  Lactobacillus helps restore the balance of gut flora often disrupted by antibiotics.

## **Alternate Names**

This specific combination drug may not have a widely recognized international nonproprietary name (INN).  The individual components are often found in various combinations with different brand names.

- **Brand Names:**  Brand names can vary regionally and are best confirmed locally in India. Some examples from the sources provided are: Taxim O CV, Ceftaclav. These may or may not contain Lactobacillus. Thenfix LB includes Lactobacillus Sporogenes as the probiotic component.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Cefixime exerts a bactericidal effect by disrupting cell wall synthesis.  Clavulanic acid itself has little antibacterial activity but protects Cefixime from beta-lactamase degradation. Lactobacillus helps maintain a healthy gut microbiome.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Cefixime:**  Administered orally, partially absorbed, and excreted renally.
    - **Clavulanic acid:** Administered orally, well-absorbed, and excreted mainly in urine.
    - **Lactobacillus:**  Taken orally, colonizes the GI tract.
- **Mode of Action:** Cefixime binds to PBPs, inhibiting transpeptidation and peptidoglycan synthesis, leading to bacterial cell lysis. Clavulanic acid inhibits beta-lactamase enzymes, preventing Cefixime inactivation.  Lactobacillus produces lactic acid, creating an acidic environment unfavorable to some pathogenic bacteria.
- **Elimination:** Cefixime is primarily eliminated by the kidneys.  Clavulanic acid is also mainly excreted renally. Lactobacillus is not absorbed and is eliminated through the GI tract.


## **Dosage**

The dosage for Cefixime + Clavulanic Acid + Lactobacillus is dependent on the patient's age, weight, the severity of the infection, and renal function. As this is a combination often prescribed according to local clinical practice, dosing can vary.


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Typically, Cefixime 200 mg + Clavulanic Acid 125 mg is given twice a day or Cefixime 400 mg + Clavulanic Acid 125 mg is given once a day.  Lactobacillus dosage varies depending on the specific strain and formulation. It's crucial to consult the specific product information for combined formulations including Lactobacillus.

#### **Children:**  Dosing is based on weight, typically 8 mg/kg/day of Cefixime, given as a single dose or divided into two doses. Clavulanic acid is dosed proportionally. Lactobacillus dosing should be adjusted according to the product information.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary in patients with impaired renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose reduction or increased dosing intervals may be required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, and monitoring is essential.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Adjustments may be needed based on specific conditions and concomitant medications.



### **Clinical Use Cases**  Specific dosage recommendations for clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations may vary according to local or institutional protocols and are not fixed for this specific combination.  Dosage will likely follow guidelines based on the infectious organism and site of infection.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage modifications should be made based on renal and hepatic function, and other patient-specific factors.




## **Side Effects**
