## **Usage**

Cefixime + Dicloxacillin + Lactobacillus is a combination medication primarily used to treat bacterial infections. It is effective against a wide range of bacterial infections, including those of the:

*   Urinary tract
*   Ears
*   Nose
*   Throat
*   Chest
*   Lungs
*   Skin
*   Soft tissues

Specifically, it is indicated for:

*   Middle ear infections (otitis media)
*   Tonsillitis and pharyngitis caused by *Streptococcus pyogenes*
*   Acute bronchitis and exacerbations of chronic bronchitis
*   Uncomplicated urinary tract infections
*   Skin and soft tissue infections caused by *Staphylococcus aureus*

It does *not* work against viral infections.

**Pharmacological Classification**: This drug combines two antibiotics (Cefixime and Dicloxacillin) and a probiotic (Lactobacillus). Cefixime is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, while Dicloxacillin is a penicillinase-resistant penicillin.

**Mechanism of Action**: Cefixime and Dicloxacillin interfere with the formation of the bacterial cell wall, which is crucial for bacterial survival. By disrupting cell wall synthesis, these antibiotics cause bacterial cell death. Lactobacillus helps restore the normal gut flora that may be disrupted by antibiotic use, thus minimizing side effects such as diarrhea.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination drug itself doesn't have a specific international nonproprietary name (INN).  It is often referred to by its component drugs.  Several brand names are available, including Zifi LBX, Lcef DX, and Ceftas CL.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics**: Cefixime and Dicloxacillin exert bactericidal effects by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis.  They bind to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in the bacterial cell wall, disrupting its structural integrity. This ultimately leads to cell lysis and bacterial death. Lactobacillus does not have a direct effect on the infection but helps maintain gut health by restoring healthy bacteria.


**Pharmacokinetics**:

*   **Absorption**: Cefixime is absorbed orally, with bioavailability around 40-50%. Dicloxacillin is also administered orally and is acid-stable, allowing for good absorption.
*   **Metabolism**: Cefixime is minimally metabolized. Dicloxacillin undergoes some metabolism in the liver.
*   **Elimination**: Cefixime is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.  Dicloxacillin is mainly excreted in the urine, with a small amount excreted in bile.

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation**: Cefixime and Dicloxacillin target PBPs involved in bacterial cell wall synthesis.  Lactobacillus does not have specific receptor interactions.

**Elimination pathways**: Cefixime and Dicloxacillin are primarily eliminated through renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults**: The standard dose is one tablet/capsule (typically containing 200 mg Cefixime, 500 mg Dicloxacillin, and a defined quantity of Lactobacillus spores, for instance 2.5 Billion Spores, or 90 Million Spores, as per the specific product) twice daily.

#### **Children**: This combination is generally *not* recommended for children under 10-12 years old, as safety and effectiveness have not been established. For older children, dosage must be determined by a physician, typically based on body weight (for cefixime component, children under 45kg: 8 mg/kg daily in a single dose or in two divided doses). 

#### **Special Cases**:

*   **Elderly Patients**: Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal function.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Dose reduction is essential based on creatinine clearance.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Caution is advised, and dosage adjustments might be needed.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**:  No specific guidance in source materials. Evaluate case by case.

### **Clinical Use Cases**
