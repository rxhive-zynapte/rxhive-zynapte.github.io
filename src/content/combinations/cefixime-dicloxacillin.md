## **Usage**

Cefixime + Dicloxacillin is a combination antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. This combination is effective against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including those that produce penicillinase.  It is commonly prescribed for infections of the respiratory tract (e.g., pharyngitis, tonsillitis, bronchitis, pneumonia), skin and soft tissues (e.g., cellulitis, impetigo, abscesses), urinary tract (e.g., cystitis, pyelonephritis),  ears (otitis media), and uncomplicated gonorrhea.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic
- **Mechanism of Action:** Cefixime inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, while Dicloxacillin, a penicillinase-resistant penicillin, also disrupts bacterial cell wall formation, particularly in penicillinase-producing bacteria.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no officially recognized alternate names for the combination of Cefixime + Dicloxacillin itself. However, the individual components have other names:

- Cefixime: Cefixime trihydrate
- Dicloxacillin: Dicloxacillin sodium

Brand names for the combination vary depending on the manufacturer and region. Some examples include Asert D, Modcef D, Mahacef XL 200 New, and Axim XL, though this is not an exhaustive list.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cefixime + Dicloxacillin exerts a bactericidal effect by disrupting the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. Cefixime, a third-generation cephalosporin, binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in the bacterial cell wall, inhibiting peptidoglycan synthesis. Dicloxacillin, a penicillinase-resistant penicillin, targets and inactivates PBPs, especially in bacteria that produce penicillinase, an enzyme that can break down some penicillins.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Dicloxacillin's absorption is reduced if taken after food, while Cefixime absorption is less affected.
* **Metabolism:** Cefixime undergoes minimal metabolism. Dicloxacillin is primarily metabolized in the liver.
* **Elimination:** Both Cefixime and Dicloxacillin are primarily eliminated via the kidneys.  Dicloxacillin's elimination half-life is approximately 0.7 hours, whereas Cefixime has a longer half-life.


## **Dosage**

Dosage guidelines for Cefixime + Dicloxacillin vary depending on the infection, patient age, and renal function. Please note that these recommendations might change, and it's important to stay updated on the latest clinical guidelines.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** A common adult dose is one tablet of Cefixime 200mg + Dicloxacillin 500mg twice daily.

#### **Children:**  The combination is generally recommended for adults and children 12 years and older.  For children under 12, the combination's safety and efficacy haven't been fully established. Dosage adjustments are required based on the child's age and weight.  Consult specialized pediatric resources and dosing guidelines for specific recommendations.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments might be necessary based on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage reduction or increased dosing interval may be required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advised, and liver function should be monitored.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Adjust dosage based on the specific comorbidity and its impact on drug metabolism and clearance.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergencies should be determined based on the specific infection being treated and the patient's overall condition.  Standard dosing guidelines may apply, but adjustments are often necessary based on individual circumstances. Always consult updated therapeutic guidelines and expert advice for these specific situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications should be considered for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.  Consult appropriate resources for specific recommendations.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Stomach pain

### **Long-Term Effects:**  Long-term use can potentially lead to liver damage.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Severe allergic reactions, severe skin reactions, liver dysfunction, and hematologic abnormalities require immediate medical attention.
