## **Usage**

This combination is prescribed for bacterial and fungal infections, particularly where a combined bacterial and fungal infection is suspected or confirmed.  Cefixime targets bacteria, while Fluconazole targets fungi.

- **Cefixime:**  A third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections, including urinary tract infections, ear infections, throat infections, and bronchitis.
- **Fluconazole:** A triazole antifungal used to treat a variety of fungal infections, such as vaginal yeast infections, oral thrush, and systemic candidiasis.

**Pharmacological Classifications:**

- Cefixime: Cephalosporin antibiotic
- Fluconazole: Triazole antifungal

**Mechanism of Action:**

- Cefixime: Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins.
- Fluconazole: Inhibits fungal ergosterol synthesis by interfering with the enzyme 14-alpha-demethylase.


## **Alternate Names**

This combination is not typically marketed under a single name. The components are commonly referred to by their generic names, Cefixime and Fluconazole. However, various brand names exist for each component individually:


**Brand names**

* **Cefixime:** Suprax, Zifi, Fixx
* **Fluconazole:** Diflucan, Trican


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

- Cefixime: Bactericidal action against susceptible bacteria.
- Fluconazole: Fungistatic or fungicidal action depending on the concentration and fungal species.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Cefixime:** Orally administered, absorbed partially, hepatic metabolism negligible, excreted primarily via renal route and biliary excretion. 
* **Fluconazole:**  Well-absorbed orally, high bioavailability, widely distributed, hepatic metabolism minimal,  renal excretion primarily as unchanged drug.


**Mode of Action:**

- Cefixime: Interferes with the transpeptidation reaction in bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to cell lysis.
- Fluconazole: Inhibits fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme 14-alpha-demethylase, preventing ergosterol synthesis which is essential for fungal cell membrane integrity.



**Elimination Pathways:**

- Cefixime: Primarily renal excretion, some biliary excretion.
- Fluconazole: Primarily renal excretion as unchanged drug.



## **Dosage**


Cefixime and Fluconazole are dosed independently based on the infection being treated and patient factors. The following are general guidelines:

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Cefixime:**  Usually 400 mg once daily or 200 mg twice daily.  Dose depends on the infection's severity.
* **Fluconazole:** Dosage varies widely depending on the infection; from 150 mg single dose for vaginal candidiasis to 400 mg daily for more serious infections.



#### **Children:**

* **Cefixime:**  8 mg/kg once daily.
* **Fluconazole:** Dosage based on body weight and the specific infection.  Consult pediatric dosing guidelines.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Cefixime: Dose adjustment may be needed in renal impairment. Fluconazole: Close monitoring and possible dose adjustments are needed, especially for renal impairment.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Both drugs require dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Cefixime: Caution advised. Fluconazole: Monitor closely, dose adjustments needed rarely
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized dosing required; consider disease interactions and drug metabolism impact


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing in specialized clinical settings is determined by the specific infection being treated and is not typically influenced by these clinical contexts.

- **Intubation:** No specific dose adjustments.
- **Surgical Procedures:** No specific dose adjustments.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** No specific dose adjustments.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** No specific dose adjustments.
- **Emergency Situations:** No specific dose adjustments.




### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on renal function, hepatic function, and other patient-specific factors (age, comorbidities, drug interactions).

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**


* **Cefixime:**  Generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* **Fluconazole:**  Use with caution during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, due to the potential risk of congenital malformations. Standard doses are generally considered acceptable during breastfeeding, but monitor the infant.
