## **Usage**

Cefixime + Lactobacillus + Ornidazole is a combination medication primarily prescribed for bacterial and parasitic infections, especially those affecting the gastrointestinal tract.  It is also effective against infections of the urinary tract, respiratory tract (including tonsillitis, pharyngitis, and bronchitis), and some sexually transmitted diseases.  This combination is sometimes used as a prophylactic measure against post-operative infections.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* **Cefixime:** Third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic
* **Lactobacillus:** Probiotic
* **Ornidazole:** Antiprotozoal, antibacterial (specifically against anaerobes)

**Mechanism of Action:**  This triple-drug combination works synergistically to combat infections and maintain gut health: Cefixime disrupts bacterial cell wall synthesis, Ornidazole damages microbial DNA and cell structures, and Lactobacillus helps restore the balance of healthy gut flora.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no internationally recognized non-proprietary names for this combination product.  A variety of brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region. Some examples of brand names offering this specific combination include: Caftyca-OZ LB, Cefmed OZ, Fimial-OZ among many others.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Cefixime:** Binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in bacterial cell walls, inhibiting cell wall synthesis and causing bacterial cell death.
* **Ornidazole:** Forms reactive radicals within microbial cells, damaging DNA, proteins, and membranes, leading to cell death.  It is effective against anaerobic bacteria and certain protozoa.
* **Lactobacillus:** Produces lactic acid, which creates an acidic gut environment.  This inhibits the growth of harmful bacteria and promotes the restoration of normal gut flora, often disrupted by antibiotic use.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Cefixime:**  Absorbed orally, peak serum concentrations reached in 2-6 hours. Excreted primarily via the kidneys.
* **Ornidazole:** Well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, excreted primarily in urine.
* **Lactobacillus:** Not systemically absorbed.  Exerts its effect locally in the gut.

**Elimination Pathways:**

* **Cefixime:** Primarily renal excretion.
* **Ornidazole:** Primarily renal excretion, some hepatic metabolism.
* **Lactobacillus:** Remains in the gastrointestinal tract.



## **Dosage**

Dosage information can vary depending on the specific product and manufacturer.  Always consult the product's prescribing information.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  

* Cefixime: 200-400 mg per day, either as a single dose or divided into two doses.
* Ornidazole: Dosage varies based on the infection being treated (typically 500-1500 mg per day).
* Lactobacillus: Dosage varies based on the specific strain and product formulation.


#### **Children:**

Cefixime is generally not recommended for children under 10 years old in certain conditions. Cefixime dosing in children is weight-based at 8 mg/kg/day, with a maximum of 400mg. Ornidazole and lactobacillus dosing needs specific pediatric guidelines, which should be verified through appropriate pediatric resources.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  May require dosage adjustments based on kidney function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Cefixime dose reduction is necessary. Ornidazole and Lactobacillus use in renal impairment necessitates dose adjustments or close monitoring.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Cefixime dosage adjustments may be required. Ornidazole use should be done cautiously in patients with liver diseases.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Patients with conditions like diabetes or cardiovascular disease may require careful monitoring.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage for clinical use cases (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, emergency situations) should be determined on a case-by-case basis by the treating physician considering the patient's condition and infection severity.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications should be considered based on renal or hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or other factors affecting drug metabolism.  Consult specific product information.




## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, headache, dizziness, indigestion, flatulence, loss of appetite, skin rash.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), pseudomembranous colitis (C. difficile infection), Stevens-Johnson syndrome.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

With prolonged use, some antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any signs of allergic reaction (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing) or severe gastrointestinal issues should be treated as a serious ADR.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to cephalosporins, penicillins, or nitroimidazoles.  Patients with a history of seizures or other neurological disorders should be monitored closely.

## **Drug Interactions**

Cefixime can interact with warfarin, probenecid, and other medications.  Ornidazole can interact with anticoagulants and alcohol. Inform your doctor about all medications being taken.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be done cautiously and only when the potential benefit outweighs the risks.  It's unknown whether this combination is excreted in breast milk.  Consult a physician.
