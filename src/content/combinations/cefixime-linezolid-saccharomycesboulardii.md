## **Usage**

This combination is prescribed for bacterial infections, particularly where there is a risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Cefixime and Linezolid are antibiotics, while Saccharomyces boulardii is a probiotic yeast.

* **Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic (Cefixime and Linezolid) and Probiotic (Saccharomyces boulardii)
* **Mechanism of Action:** Cefixime inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis. Linezolid inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. Saccharomyces boulardii helps restore normal gut flora, preventing or treating antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is not widely recognized by other names, though may be referenced by its individual components. There are no popular brand names specifically for this combination, however, some brands containing the three components may be available, though their availability might be limited. One example found is Aelxim-L Tablet, containing Cefixime (200mg) + Linezolid (600mg) + Saccharomyces boulardii (2Million spores), manufactured by Allenge India. Note that brand names and availability can vary significantly by region. It is always advisable to check with local pharmaceutical resources for accurate and up-to-date information.

## **How It Works**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Cefixime disrupts bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), leading to bacterial cell death. Linezolid prevents the formation of functional ribosomal complexes in bacteria, thus inhibiting protein synthesis. Saccharomyces boulardii competes with pathogenic bacteria for resources and adhesion sites in the gut, thereby reducing the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. It also promotes the production of secretory IgA and enhances the intestinal barrier function.


* **Pharmacokinetics:**
    * **Cefixime:** Orally administered Cefixime is absorbed variably, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 2-6 hours. It is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine, with a half-life of 3-4 hours.
    * **Linezolid:**  Linezolid exhibits near 100% oral bioavailability, with peak concentrations occurring in 1-2 hours. It undergoes non-enzymatic metabolism, primarily in the liver, and is eliminated through renal excretion.  Its half-life is approximately 4-6 hours.
    * **Saccharomyces boulardii:** As a non-colonizing yeast, it transiently resides in the gastrointestinal tract and is eliminated in the feces within 2-5 days after discontinuation.


* **Mode of Action:**
    * **Cefixime:** Interferes with bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).
    * **Linezolid:** Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S subunit.
    * **Saccharomyces boulardii:** Competes with pathogenic bacteria for resources and adhesion sites in the gut, supports the growth of beneficial bacteria, produces lactic acid and short-chain fatty acids which create an unfavorable environment for pathogenic bacteria, and enhances gut barrier integrity and immune function.
* **Elimination Pathways:**
    * **Cefixime:** Primarily renal excretion.
    * **Linezolid:** Mainly renal excretion.
    * **Saccharomyces boulardii:** Elimination in feces.


## **Dosage**

This combination is not a standard, fixed-dose combination. The dosage and usage should be determined by a physician on a case-by-case basis. The following provides information on the individual components, which can aid in determining a suitable combination dose.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Cefixime:**  400 mg once daily or 200 mg every 12 hours.
* **Linezolid:** 600 mg every 12 hours.
* **Saccharomyces boulardii:** 250-500 mg one to two times daily.

#### **Children:**

* **Cefixime:** 8 mg/kg/day as a single dose or in two divided doses. Pediatric doses should be adjusted based on age, weight and the specific infection being treated. Consult dedicated pediatric dosing guidelines for precise administration in children below 12.
