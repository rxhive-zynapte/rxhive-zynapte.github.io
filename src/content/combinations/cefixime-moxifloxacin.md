## **Usage**

Cefixime + Moxifloxacin is a combination antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections, including:

*   Respiratory tract infections (e.g., bronchitis, pneumonia)
*   Urinary tract infections
*   Skin and soft tissue infections
*   Sexually transmitted infections (e.g., gonorrhea, pelvic inflammatory disease)
*   Typhoid fever
*   Sinusitis
*   Otitis media (ear infection)
*   Tonsillitis

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antibacterial (Combination of a cephalosporin and a fluoroquinolone)

**Mechanism of Action:** Cefixime inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by disrupting peptidoglycan cross-linking. Moxifloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for DNA replication and repair. The combination provides broad-spectrum coverage.


## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for the combination itself. However, the individual components are known by their generic names (cefixime and moxifloxacin) and various brand names (e.g., Monarquin Plus).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cefixime disrupts bacterial cell wall integrity, leading to cell death. Moxifloxacin interferes with bacterial DNA replication and repair, ultimately causing bacterial death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Both drugs are absorbed orally. Food may slightly delay cefixime absorption but doesn't significantly affect moxifloxacin.
*   **Metabolism:** Cefixime is minimally metabolized. Moxifloxacin undergoes some glucuronidation.
*   **Elimination:** Cefixime is primarily excreted renally. Moxifloxacin is excreted in both urine and feces.

**Mode of Action:** Cefixime targets penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) involved in cell wall synthesis. Moxifloxacin targets bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, inhibiting DNA replication and repair.

**Elimination Pathways:** Cefixime is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Moxifloxacin is eliminated through both renal and hepatic pathways, with glucuronidation being a minor metabolic pathway.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 400 mg of cefixime and 400 mg of moxifloxacin, both administered once daily.

#### **Children:** Use with caution in children below 12 years of age. Dosage is weight-based and should be determined by a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Generally, no dosage adjustment is needed unless renal function is impaired.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Cefixime dosage should be adjusted based on creatinine clearance. Moxifloxacin dosage adjustment may also be necessary.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Cefixime dosage adjustment is generally not required. Moxifloxacin should be used with caution, and dosage adjustments may be needed.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with diabetes, epilepsy, heart disease, and electrolyte imbalances.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosages in specific clinical settings are similar to standard dosages, with the duration of treatment determined by the infection's severity and clinical response.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are based on renal and hepatic function, as described above.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Headache
*   Dizziness
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Diarrhea
*   Abdominal pain
*   Flatulence

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   QT interval prolongation
*   Seizures
*   Tendonitis/tendon rupture
*   *Clostridium difficile* infection
*   Severe allergic reactions

### **Long-Term Effects:**

*   Peripheral neuropathy (rare)


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

*   Anaphylaxis
*   Stevens-Johnson Syndrome
*   Toxic epidermal necrolysis


## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to cefixime, moxifloxacin, or other quinolones/cephalosporins.
*   History of QT prolongation or cardiac arrhythmias.
*   Pregnancy and breastfeeding (generally contraindicated).
*   Children under 12 years of age (use with caution).
*   Myasthenia gravis.

## **Drug Interactions**

*   Antacids, sucralfate, metal cations (reduce absorption).
*   Anticoagulants (warfarin).
*   Antiarrhythmics (amiodarone).
*   Anticonvulsants (carbamazepine).
*   CYP450 substrates.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Generally contraindicated due to potential risks to the fetus and newborn.
