## **Usage**

Cefixime + Ofloxacin is a combination antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections, including typhoid fever and urinary tract infections (UTIs). Its pharmacological classifications are cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Cefixime inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, while Ofloxacin blocks bacterial DNA replication, leading to bacterial death.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is often referred to as Cefixime and Ofloxacin. Brand names include Cefix-O, Extracef-Plus, Thenix Plus, and Cefexotime 0, among others.  (Please note that brand names can vary regionally.)

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cefixime interferes with bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Ofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes crucial for DNA replication and repair.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Cefixime:** Approximately 40-50% is absorbed orally, with higher absorption from suspension than tablets. It's minimally metabolized and excreted primarily in urine, with a half-life of about 3 hours.
* **Ofloxacin:** Well-absorbed orally.  It undergoes some hepatic metabolism and is eliminated through renal and hepatic routes.

**Mode of Action:**  This combination acts synergistically. Cefixime weakens the bacterial cell wall, while Ofloxacin prevents DNA replication, ultimately leading to bacterial death.

**Elimination Pathways:** Cefixime is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Ofloxacin is excreted both renally and hepatically.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  One tablet of Cefixime 200 mg + Ofloxacin 200 mg twice daily for up to 14 days.


#### **Children:**  This combination is generally not recommended for children and growing adolescents due to the risks associated with Ofloxacin.  Specifically, Ofloxacin carries a risk of cartilage damage in developing children.  While Cefixime may be used in children for certain infections (dosage based on weight), Ofloxacin should generally be avoided unless specifically prescribed by a doctor for exceptional cases where the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments are generally required only for renal or hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Cefixime dosage should not exceed 200 mg once daily if creatinine clearance is less than 20 mL/min. Ofloxacin dosage should also be reduced based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Ofloxacin dosage may need to be reduced in severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with diabetes, epilepsy, myasthenia gravis, or a history of tendon disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations would follow the standard adult dosage guidelines or be adjusted based on patient-specific factors, including organ function, as described above. No source specifically addressed these scenarios.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on renal and hepatic function and other factors as outlined in the "Special Cases" section.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, indigestion, headache, dizziness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), severe diarrhea (pseudomembranous colitis), tendonitis, tendon rupture, QT prolongation, seizures (especially in those with a history of epilepsy), peripheral neuropathy, and exacerbation of myasthenia gravis.


### **Long-Term Effects:**  Peripheral neuropathy and tendon issues can persist even after discontinuation.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Any signs of allergic reaction, severe diarrhea, or tendon pain require immediate attention.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to cefixime, ofloxacin, or other quinolones/cephalosporins. Epilepsy. History of tendon disorders related to fluoroquinolone use.  Pregnancy. Breastfeeding. G6PD deficiency. Myasthenia gravis. Children and adolescents.

## **Drug Interactions**

Antacids, sucralfate, H2 blockers (e.g., cimetidine), probenecid, warfarin, theophylline, NSAIDs, some antidiabetic agents, and some other antibiotics.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

This combination is contraindicated in both pregnancy and breastfeeding. Cefixime is pregnancy category B, meaning animal studies haven't shown fetal harm, but adequate human studies are lacking. Ofloxacin is category C, meaning animal studies have shown some adverse effects, and its use is generally avoided in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Safer alternatives should be considered.

## **Popular Combinations**

No specific combinations are widely recognized for Cefixime + Ofloxacin beyond its combined formulation.

## **Precautions**

Pre-existing medical conditions (renal/hepatic impairment, diabetes, epilepsy, myasthenia gravis) should be assessed.  Alcohol should be avoided, and caution should be exercised when driving or operating machinery.
