## **Usage**

Cefixime + Ornidazole is a combination antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial and parasitic infections, including:

*   Urinary tract infections
*   Respiratory tract infections (e.g., bronchitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, otitis media)
*   Gonorrhea
*   Gastrointestinal infections (e.g., amebiasis, giardiasis, dysentery)
*   Periodontitis and dental abscesses
*   Bacterial vaginosis
*   Surgical prophylaxis

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic (Cefixime is a third-generation cephalosporin, Ornidazole is a nitroimidazole).

**Mechanism of Action:** Cefixime inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Ornidazole damages bacterial and protozoal DNA, leading to cell death.



## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist. Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer.  Some popular brand names include:

* Cefolac OZ
* Ornicef
* Afime-OZ



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cefixime exerts bactericidal activity by disrupting cell wall synthesis. Ornidazole is also bactericidal and parasiticidal, causing DNA damage.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Cefixime:** Absorption is variable, not significantly affected by food.  Excreted primarily unchanged in urine.
*   **Ornidazole:** Well absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver, primarily excreted in urine.

**Mode of Action:** Cefixime binds to PBPs, inhibiting the final step of peptidoglycan synthesis. Ornidazole forms reactive radicals that damage microbial DNA.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 200-400 mg of Cefixime and 500-1500 mg of Ornidazole, given once or twice daily for 7-14 days. The specific dosage and duration depend on the infection being treated.

#### **Children:** 8 mg/kg/day of Cefixime, either as a single dose or divided every 12 hours.  Children over 45 kg may receive adult doses. Ornidazole dosing should be adjusted according to body weight.

#### **Special Cases:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary in elderly patients and those with renal or hepatic impairment.  Consultation with a nephrologist or hepatologist is recommended.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Specific dosage adjustments for clinical scenarios like intubation, surgery, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use should be based on the individual patient's condition and the infecting organism.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modification is required in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

*   Diarrhea
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
