## **Usage**

Cefixime + Potassium Clavulanate is prescribed for bacterial infections, including upper and lower respiratory tract infections (such as bronchitis, sinusitis, pharyngitis, and tonsillitis), urinary tract infections, otitis media, and uncomplicated gonorrhea.  Its pharmacological classification is antibiotic. Potassium clavulanate is a beta-lactamase inhibitor that enhances cefixime's activity against bacteria that produce beta-lactamase, an enzyme that can break down certain antibiotics.

## **Alternate Names**

While there isn't a universally recognized alternate name, this combination is often referred to as "Cefixime with Clavulanate" or "Cefixime and Clavulanic Acid." Brand names vary depending on the region and manufacturer.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cefixime exerts its antibacterial action by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis, ultimately leading to cell death.  Specifically, it interferes with the transpeptidation reaction in the final steps of peptidoglycan synthesis, making the cell wall defective and prone to lysis. Clavulanate potassium irreversibly binds to and inhibits bacterial beta-lactamases, thus protecting cefixime from enzymatic degradation and extending its antibacterial spectrum.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Cefixime is absorbed orally, although food may slightly delay the rate but not the extent of absorption. Peak serum concentrations are typically reached 2 to 6 hours after administration. It has low protein binding. Cefixime is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine, with about 50% of the dose recovered in the urine within 24 hours.  Clavulanate potassium is well-absorbed after oral administration. It is primarily eliminated via renal excretion, with approximately 60% of the dose eliminated in the urine within 6 hours.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The typical adult dose is 200-400 mg of cefixime daily, given as a single dose or in two divided doses.  For uncomplicated gonorrhea, a single dose of 400 mg is often sufficient. The usual treatment duration is 7 days, but it can be extended to 14 days if needed.

#### **Children (6 months and older):** The recommended pediatric dose is 8 mg/kg/day of cefixime, administered as a single daily dose or in two divided doses (4 mg/kg every 12 hours).  Safety and efficacy haven't been established for children younger than 6 months. Children weighing more than 50 kg or older than 10-12 years can receive the adult dose.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments are generally not necessary unless renal impairment exists.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min. For creatinine clearance 21-60 mL/min, 260 mg daily is recommended.  If creatinine clearance is less than 20 mL/min, the dose should not exceed 200 mg daily.  Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis do not significantly remove cefixime from the circulation.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Exercise caution and monitor liver function tests. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Individualized assessment and dose adjustment might be necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for cefixime + potassium clavulanate are specific to the infection being treated and are not indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations such as cardiac arrest. Cefixime is generally used for relatively straightforward infections as described earlier.  Other antibiotic regimens would be considered for more complex or severe infections typically encountered in these clinical settings.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting, loose stools, headache, dizziness, flatulence, and itching.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Allergic reactions (including skin rash, hives, itching, fever, swelling, difficulty breathing, anaphylaxis), *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea (pseudomembranous colitis), transient hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, eosinophilia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to cefixime, other cephalosporins, or any component of the formulation. History of severe hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) to penicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Anticoagulants:** Cefixime may enhance the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, increasing the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of prothrombin time/INR and dosage adjustments of anticoagulants may be needed.
* **Probenecid:** Probenecid can increase cefixime serum concentrations by reducing renal excretion.
* **Antacids:** Concomitant administration of antacids containing aluminum or magnesium hydroxide may slightly decrease the absorption of cefixime.
* **Carbamazepine:** Cefixime may elevate carbamazepine levels.  Serum carbamazepine concentration monitoring is advised.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Cefixime + Potassium Clavulanate is classified under Pregnancy Category B by the FDA, signifying no demonstrated risk to the fetus in animal studies. However, there are no well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Its use during pregnancy should be reserved for situations where the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. Cefixime is excreted in breast milk. While usually considered compatible with breastfeeding, potential risks to nursing infants should be considered.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Cefixime inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis; potassium clavulanate extends cefixime's spectrum by inhibiting beta-lactamases.
* **Side Effects:** Common: Diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain. Serious: Allergic reactions, *C. difficile* colitis.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to cephalosporins/penicillins.
* **Drug Interactions:** Warfarin, probenecid, antacids, carbamazepine.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category B; compatible with breastfeeding (with caution).
* **Dosage:** Adults: 200â€“400 mg/day; Children: 8 mg/kg/day.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Renal function tests (especially in patients with renal impairment), liver function tests (if prolonged use or pre-existing liver disease), complete blood count (if signs of blood dyscrasias), and observation for allergic reactions.

## **Popular Combinations**

Not applicable.  Combination therapy is not routinely recommended with this particular formulation.


## **Precautions**
* History of penicillin allergy (risk of cross-reactivity).
* Renal impairment requires dose adjustment.
* Monitor for signs of superinfection (e.g., oral or vaginal candidiasis).
* Prolonged use may alter gut flora, increasing the risk of *C. difficile* infection.
