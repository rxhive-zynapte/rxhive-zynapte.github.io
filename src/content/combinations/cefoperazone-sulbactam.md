## **Usage**

Cefoperazone + Sulbactam is prescribed for a wide range of bacterial infections, including:

*   Respiratory Tract Infections (upper and lower)
*   Urinary Tract Infections (upper and lower)
*   Intra-abdominal Infections
*   Septicemia
*   Meningitis
*   Skin and Soft Tissue Infections
*   Bone and Joint Infections
*   Endometritis and other infections of the genital tract
*   Febrile Neutropenia

**Pharmacological Classification:** Cefoperazone + Sulbactam is a beta-lactam antibiotic combination. Cefoperazone is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, and Sulbactam is a beta-lactamase inhibitor.

**Mechanism of Action:** Cefoperazone inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death. Sulbactam inhibits beta-lactamase enzymes produced by bacteria, which would otherwise inactivate Cefoperazone. This combination broadens Cefoperazone's spectrum of activity against bacteria resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics.

## **Alternate Names**

Cefoperazone sodium + Sulbactam sodium. Some common brand names include Sulperazon, Magnex, and Cefratam.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cefoperazone exerts its bactericidal effect by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), crucial enzymes for bacterial cell wall synthesis. This binding disrupts cell wall integrity, causing bacterial cell lysis and death. Sulbactam does not have significant antibacterial activity on its own but irreversibly binds to and inhibits beta-lactamases, protecting Cefoperazone from degradation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Cefoperazone + Sulbactam is administered parenterally (IV or IM) and achieves therapeutic concentrations in various tissues and fluids.
*   **Metabolism:** Cefoperazone undergoes minimal metabolism. Sulbactam is partly metabolized in the liver.
*   **Elimination:** Cefoperazone is primarily excreted in bile, with a small portion eliminated renally. Sulbactam is mainly excreted renally. Dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with renal impairment, specifically for Sulbactam.


**Elimination Pathways:** Cefoperazone is primarily eliminated through biliary excretion, while Sulbactam is predominantly eliminated by the kidneys.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The usual adult dose is 2-4 g/day (1-2 g Cefoperazone activity) administered IV or IM every 12 hours. In severe infections, the dosage can be increased up to 8 g/day IV (4 g Cefoperazone activity) or 12 g/day of a 1:2 ratio preparation. The maximum daily dose of Sulbactam is 4 g.

#### **Children:**

The usual pediatric dose is 40-80 mg/kg/day (20-40 mg/kg/day Cefoperazone activity) administered every 6-12 hours, divided into 2-4 equal doses.  In serious or refractory infections, this can be increased up to 160 mg/kg/day (80 mg/kg/day Cefoperazone) of the 1:1 ratio or 240 mg/kg/day (160 mg/kg/day Cefoperazone) of the 1:2 ratio in 2-4 divided doses. For neonates in the first week of life, administer every 12 hours. The maximum daily Sulbactam dose in pediatrics should not exceed 80 mg/kg/day. If higher doses are required, administer additional Cefoperazone separately.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments are generally not needed but caution is advised in patients with renal impairment.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Sulbactam dosage needs to be adjusted based on creatinine clearance. For creatinine clearance 15-30 ml/min, the maximum Sulbactam dose is 1 g every 12 hours. For creatinine clearance <15 ml/min, the maximum Sulbactam dose is 500 mg every 12 hours. Cefoperazone can be administered without adjustment.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustments may be required in severe biliary obstruction or severe liver disease, especially in patients with concomitant renal impairment.  Serum concentrations should be closely monitored, and the Cefoperazone dose should not exceed 2 g/day without close monitoring.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Carefully evaluate patients with comorbidities, particularly those on anticoagulant therapy, due to potential bleeding risks.  Vitamin K may be required.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing for clinical use cases generally follows the standard adult recommendations with adjustments as needed based on severity of infection and patient-specific factors like renal and hepatic function.  Consider local guidelines and recommendations in these settings.

*   **Intubation:** Standard dosing with adjustments based on patient factors
*   **Surgical Procedures (prophylactic/therapeutic):** Standard dosing with adjustments based on patient factors
*   **Mechanical Ventilation:** Standard dosing with adjustments based on patient factors
*   **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Standard dosing with adjustments based on patient factors
*   **Emergency Situations:** Standard dosing with adjustments based on patient factors


### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Adjustments are based on creatinine clearance for renal impairment, severity of hepatic dysfunction, and presence of comorbid conditions.  Therapeutic drug monitoring of cefoperazone serum levels may be beneficial in patients with hepatic and/or renal dysfunction.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Diarrhea
*   Nausea and vomiting
*   Rash
*   Pain at the injection site
*   Eosinophilia


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Pseudomembranous colitis
*   Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
*   Bleeding disorders (hypoprothrombinemia)
*   Neutropenia
*   Seizures (rare)
*   Hepatotoxicity (rare)


### **Long-Term Effects:**

*   Superinfection (overgrowth of resistant organisms)
*   Vitamin K deficiency


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe hypersensitivity reactions,  bleeding manifestations, *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea, and severe neutropenia require immediate intervention.


## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to Cefoperazone, Sulbactam, or any other beta-lactam antibiotics.

## **Drug Interactions**

*   **Anticoagulants:** Cefoperazone can increase the risk of bleeding when used with anticoagulants like warfarin.  Monitor INR closely.
*   **Probenecid:** Can decrease renal excretion of Cefoperazone.
*   **Alcohol:** Concomitant alcohol consumption may cause a disulfiram-like reaction.
*   **Aminoglycosides:**  Increased risk of nephrotoxicity. Monitor renal function if aminoglycosides are used concomitantly.
