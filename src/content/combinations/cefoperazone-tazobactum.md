## **Usage**

- Cefoperazone + Tazobactam is prescribed for a wide range of bacterial infections, including intra-abdominal infections, respiratory tract infections (pneumonia, bronchitis), skin and soft tissue infections, urinary tract infections, septicemia, and bacterial meningitis.  It is particularly effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic, specifically a third-generation cephalosporin combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Cefoperazone inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death. Tazobactam inhibits beta-lactamase, an enzyme produced by some bacteria that can break down cefoperazone, thereby extending cefoperazone's spectrum of activity.

## **Alternate Names**

-  Cefoperazone/Tazobactam
- **Brand Names:**  Numerous brand names exist, including Magnex, Ceftum, Cefopar, and others, which may vary regionally.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Cefoperazone + Tazobactam exerts bactericidal activity by disrupting bacterial cell wall synthesis. Tazobactam enhances cefoperazone's effectiveness by inhibiting beta-lactamase enzymes produced by certain bacteria.  It is particularly effective against gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). Cefoperazone achieves peak plasma concentrations within 1 to 2 hours after IM administration. Tazobactam exhibits nonlinear, dose-dependent pharmacokinetics. Cefoperazone is excreted primarily in bile, while tazobactam is eliminated mainly through renal excretion.  Cefoperazone's half-life is approximately 2 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Cefoperazone binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall, inhibiting the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis. Tazobactam irreversibly binds to and inactivates beta-lactamases.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Cefoperazone is primarily excreted in bile, while tazobactam is predominantly excreted through the kidneys.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The typical adult dose is 2 to 4 grams per day, administered in equally divided doses every 12 hours.
- For severe infections, higher doses (up to 12 g/day) may be used.

#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 12 years.
- Dosing in older children (â‰¥12 years) may follow adult recommendations, adjusted for weight and renal function.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Monitor renal function; dosage adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce the dose based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advised; dosage adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Individualized dosing may be required based on specific conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations:** Dosing should be based on infection severity and adjusted according to renal function.  Standard adult doses are often appropriate, but higher doses may be necessary in severe infections.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose modification is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, based on the degree of impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
- Diarrhea
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Pain and inflammation at the injection site
- Rash


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
- Pseudomembranous colitis (Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea)
- Bleeding or bruising
- Jaundice


### **Long-Term Effects**
- With prolonged use, some patients may develop vitamin K deficiency, increasing the risk of bleeding.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
-  Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.
- Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
- Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)


## **Contraindications**
- Known hypersensitivity to cefoperazone, tazobactam, penicillins, or other cephalosporins.


## **Drug Interactions**
- Alcohol (disulfiram-like reaction)
- Aminoglycosides (increased risk of nephrotoxicity)
- Anticoagulants (increased risk of bleeding)
- Probenecid (may increase cefoperazone levels)


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; use only if clearly needed.
- Cefoperazone crosses the placenta, and low concentrations are found in breast milk. Use with caution during breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis (Cefoperazone) and beta-lactamase inhibitor (Tazobactam).
- **Side Effects:**  Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, injection site reactions, rash, allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to cefoperazone, tazobactam, penicillins, or other cephalosporins.
- **Drug Interactions:**  Alcohol, aminoglycosides, anticoagulants, probenecid.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; no adequate studies in pregnant women.
- **Dosage:**  2-4g/day divided every 12 hours (adults); adjust for renal/hepatic impairment.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, liver function tests, complete blood count, signs of allergic reaction.


## **Popular Combinations**

-  Often used as a single agent due to its broad spectrum.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess for history of allergies to beta-lactam antibiotics. Monitor renal and hepatic function.
- **Specific Populations:** Use cautiously in pregnant/breastfeeding women, elderly, and patients with renal/hepatic impairment.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid alcohol during and for several days after treatment.
