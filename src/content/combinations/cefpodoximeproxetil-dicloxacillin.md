## **Usage**

- Cefpodoxime proxetil + dicloxacillin is prescribed for bacterial infections of the respiratory tract (including sinusitis, pneumonia, tonsillitis, bronchitis, pharyngitis), urinary tract, skin, and soft tissues.  It is effective against infections caused by susceptible strains of *Staphylococcus aureus* (including penicillinase-producing strains), *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, *Moraxella catarrhalis*, and other susceptible bacteria.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic (combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and a penicillinase-resistant penicillin)
- **Mechanism of Action:** Cefpodoxime inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Dicloxacillin, a penicillinase-resistant penicillin, also inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis but is effective against bacteria that produce penicillinase, an enzyme that breaks down some penicillins.  The combination provides broader coverage against bacterial infections.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific drug combination.
- **Brand names:** This combination is available under various brand names depending on the manufacturer and region. Some examples include Cefoclox-XL, Gudcef-XL, Ceedoric DX.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Cefpodoxime and dicloxacillin are bactericidal, meaning they kill bacteria by disrupting cell wall synthesis. This leads to cell lysis and bacterial death.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Cefpodoxime proxetil is an ester prodrug that is hydrolyzed to its active form, cefpodoxime, after oral administration. Absorption is enhanced when taken with food. Dicloxacillin is also absorbed orally, but its absorption may be delayed by food.
    - **Metabolism:** Cefpodoxime is minimally metabolized. Dicloxacillin is partially metabolized in the liver.
    - **Elimination:** Cefpodoxime is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.  Dicloxacillin is mainly excreted in the urine, both as unchanged drug and metabolites.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 200 mg cefpodoxime + 500 mg dicloxacillin every 12 hours, taken with food.  Duration of therapy depends on the infection being treated, typically 7-10 days.

#### **Children:**  Dosage is based on weight or age and should be determined by a doctor.  This combination is generally not recommended for children under 12 years of age unless specifically prescribed by a physician.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary in patients with impaired renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are required based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advised, and dosage adjustments may be needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider individual patient factors and adjust dosage as appropriate.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage for specific medical settings is similar to the standard dosage and should be tailored based on individual patient factors. This combination is not specifically indicated for use in intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.  Other antibiotic regimens are typically preferred in these settings.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage modifications are required for patients with renal impairment. The dose should be reduced according to creatinine clearance.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
- Diarrhea
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Abdominal pain
- Headache
- Rash


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
- *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea (CDAD)
- Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
- Stevens-Johnson syndrome
- Seizures


### **Long-Term Effects:**
- Potential for *Clostridium difficile* overgrowth with prolonged use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
-  Anaphylaxis and other severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**
- Hypersensitivity to cefpodoxime, dicloxacillin, other cephalosporins, or penicillins.
- History of severe allergic reactions to beta-lactam antibiotics.


## **Drug Interactions**
- Probenecid may increase cefpodoxime levels.
- Antacids may decrease the absorption of cefpodoxime.
- Dicloxacillin may decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives.
- Warfarin: Monitor INR closely when co-administered.
- Other antibiotics (e.g., tetracyclines): potential for antagonism.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Cefpodoxime and dicloxacillin are generally considered safe to use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, the potential benefits should outweigh the risks, and use should be under the guidance of a physician.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis.
- **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, rash. Rarely: CDAD, allergic reactions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, seizures.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to cefpodoxime, dicloxacillin, or other beta-lactams.
- **Drug Interactions:** Probenecid, antacids, oral contraceptives, warfarin, other antibiotics.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe, but consult physician.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 200 mg cefpodoxime + 500 mg dicloxacillin every 12 hours.  Pediatric: Consult physician.  Renal adjustments needed.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Observe for signs of allergic reactions, superinfection (e.g., CDAD), and monitor renal function in patients with renal impairment.


## **Popular Combinations**

Not applicable. This is already a combination product.


## **Precautions**

- Assess for allergies to cephalosporins and penicillins before administration.
- Monitor renal function, especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment.
- Evaluate for signs and symptoms of superinfection, including CDAD.
- Caution in patients with a history of gastrointestinal disorders, particularly colitis.
