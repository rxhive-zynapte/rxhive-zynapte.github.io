## **Usage**

Cefpodoxime proxetil + sulbactam is prescribed for bacterial infections such as respiratory tract infections (including pneumonia, bronchitis, and sinusitis), otitis media (ear infections), skin and soft tissue infections, urinary tract infections, and gonorrhea.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Antibiotic (β-lactam, third-generation cephalosporin combined with a β-lactamase inhibitor).

**Mechanism of Action:** Cefpodoxime inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Sulbactam, a β-lactamase inhibitor, protects cefpodoxime from degradation by bacterial enzymes, extending its spectrum of activity.

## **Alternate Names**

Cefpodoxime proxetil/sulbactam

**Brand Names:**  Sulbapod, Cefpodox, others (brand names may vary regionally).

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cefpodoxime, as a third-generation cephalosporin, exerts bactericidal activity by interfering with the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell walls.  Sulbactam irreversibly inhibits β-lactamases produced by many bacteria, preventing cefpodoxime degradation and extending its antibacterial activity.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Cefpodoxime proxetil is an oral prodrug that is hydrolyzed to the active cefpodoxime after absorption.  Bioavailability is approximately 50% and can be slightly enhanced by food. Peak serum concentrations are reached in 2-3 hours. Cefpodoxime is moderately protein-bound (22-33%).  It is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Sulbactam is well absorbed orally. It is also primarily renally excreted.

**Mode of Action:** Cefpodoxime binds to specific PBPs in the bacterial cell wall, disrupting cell wall integrity. Sulbactam binds to and inactivates bacterial β-lactamases.

**Elimination Pathways:** Both cefpodoxime and sulbactam are primarily eliminated by renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 200 mg cefpodoxime/125 mg sulbactam every 12 hours for 10-14 days depending on the infection.


#### **Children (2 months to 12 years):** 5 mg cefpodoxime/3.75 mg sulbactam per kg of body weight every 12 hours.  Dosages should not exceed the adult dose. Safety and effectiveness in infants younger than 2 months have not been established.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are needed unless renal function is impaired.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary. For creatinine clearances of 30 mL/min or less, interval may need to be increased to 24 hours.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are generally needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider patient-specific factors and the possibility of drug interactions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing for specific clinical situations should be individualized based on the patient's condition, infection severity, and pathogen susceptibility. Intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations often require higher doses of antibiotics, and IV administration may be more appropriate. Always consult local guidelines and infectious disease experts when determining appropriate antibiotic dosing in these contexts.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are primarily needed in patients with renal impairment.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, vaginitis, diaper rash (in infants).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Pseudomembranous colitis ( *Clostridium difficile* -associated diarrhea), allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis, angioedema), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential for *Clostridium difficile*  infection with prolonged use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to cefpodoxime, sulbactam, or other cephalosporins or β-lactam antibiotics.


## **Drug Interactions**

Antacids, H2 blockers, and proton pump inhibitors can reduce the absorption of cefpodoxime proxetil. Probenecid may increase serum concentrations of cefpodoxime. Monitor for increased bleeding risk with concurrent use of anticoagulants. Cefpodoxime may reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives. Concurrent use with drugs that can cause renal damage should be monitored carefully.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy:** Cefpodoxime is generally considered safe to use during pregnancy (Pregnancy Category B), although there are no controlled studies in pregnant women. The benefits of treatment must be weighed against potential risks.


**Breastfeeding:** Cefpodoxime is present in low levels in breast milk. Although adverse effects in nursing infants are considered unlikely, they are possible. Monitor infants for diarrhea, candidiasis, and allergic reactions.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis; sulbactam protects cefpodoxime from degradation by bacterial enzymes.
* **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to cephalosporins or β-lactam antibiotics.
* **Drug Interactions:** Antacids, H2 blockers, probenecid, anticoagulants, hormonal contraceptives.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe during pregnancy (Category B); low levels in breast milk.
* **Dosage:**  Adults: 200/125 mg every 12 hours; Children: 5/3.75 mg/kg every 12 hours.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function tests (in patients with renal impairment).

## **Popular Combinations**


Not applicable.



## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess for history of allergies to penicillin or other β-lactams. Monitor renal function in patients with renal insufficiency.
* **Specific Populations:** Monitor for adverse reactions in pregnant/breastfeeding women, children, and the elderly.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  No specific lifestyle considerations.
