      treatment, and use additional contraceptive measures if they are taking
      oral hormonal contraceptives.  Advise patients to increase fluid intake to
      mitigate dehydration caused by diarrhea.

## **Usage**

- Ceftriaxone + Sulbactam is prescribed for a wide range of bacterial infections, including sepsis, meningitis, abdominal infections (such as peritonitis and biliary tract infections), bone and joint infections, skin and soft tissue infections, urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections (especially pneumonia), ear, nose, and throat infections, and uncomplicated gonorrhea.  It is also used for pre-operative prophylaxis to reduce the risk of post-operative infections.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antibiotic (beta-lactam/cephalosporin combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death. Sulbactam is a beta-lactamase inhibitor that protects ceftriaxone from being broken down by bacterial enzymes, thus extending its effectiveness against a wider range of bacteria, including those that produce beta-lactamases.

## **Alternate Names**

-  This medication is often referred to as ceftriaxone/sulbactam.
- **Brand Names:**  Numerous brand names exist worldwide including Injxone SB, Sultrex, Alcef-SB, and Traxol-S. Brand names can vary depending on the region and manufacturer.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ceftriaxone exerts its bactericidal effect by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which are essential for bacterial cell wall synthesis.  This binding disrupts the cross-linking of peptidoglycans, weakening the cell wall and ultimately causing cell lysis and death.  Sulbactam irreversibly inhibits beta-lactamase enzymes, thereby protecting ceftriaxone from degradation and broadening its spectrum of activity.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Ceftriaxone is well-absorbed after intramuscular administration and achieves high serum concentrations. It is widely distributed throughout the body, including the cerebrospinal fluid, making it effective against meningitis.  Ceftriaxone is primarily excreted by the kidneys, while a smaller portion is eliminated in the bile. Sulbactam is also well-absorbed and distributed, and it is primarily excreted by the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:** Ceftriaxone interferes with the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell walls.  Sulbactam forms a stable, inactive complex with beta-lactamase enzymes, preventing them from hydrolyzing the beta-lactam ring of ceftriaxone.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Ceftriaxone is excreted via both renal and biliary routes, with approximately 60% excreted unchanged in the urine and 40% excreted in the bile. Sulbactam is primarily eliminated through renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The usual adult dose is 1.5 g (1 g ceftriaxone + 0.5 g sulbactam) to 3 g (2 g ceftriaxone + 1 g sulbactam) every 6 to 12 hours, administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). The total daily dose of ceftriaxone should not exceed 4 g, and the total daily dose of sulbactam should not exceed 4 g.

#### **Children:**

- **Neonates (up to 14 days):** 20-50 mg/kg/day once daily (IV). Do not exceed 50 mg/kg/day.
- **Infants and children (15 days to 12 years):** 20-80 mg/kg/day once daily (IV or IM). For children weighing 50 kg or more, use the adult dose.
- IV doses of 50 mg/kg or more should be infused over at least 30 minutes.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for elderly patients with impaired renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are required for patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min. Monitor serum levels closely.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dosage adjustment may be required in patients with both hepatic and renal dysfunction. Monitor serum levels closely.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised for patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease, especially colitis.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:** Dosage typically ranges from 1.5g to 3g every 6-12 hours, depending on the severity of the infection.
- **Emergency Situations:**  Initial doses may be higher, with subsequent adjustments based on patient response and clinical condition.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments are based on creatinine clearance and should be made for patients with renal impairment.  For patients with both hepatic and renal dysfunction, close monitoring of serum concentrations is essential, and dosages should not exceed 3 g daily without such monitoring.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Pain, induration, and tenderness at the injection site
- Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting
- Rash, pruritus

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Pseudomembranous colitis
- Hepatic dysfunction
- Hematologic abnormalities (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Potential for *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea with prolonged use.
- Alterations in gut microbiota


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Anaphylaxis, severe skin reactions


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to ceftriaxone, sulbactam, other cephalosporins, or penicillins
- History of severe allergic reactions to beta-lactam antibiotics


## **Drug Interactions**

- Probenecid decreases renal excretion of sulbactam.
- Ceftriaxone may reduce the efficacy of oral hormonal contraceptives.
- Antagonistic in vitro effects have been observed with chloramphenicol.
- Alcohol may cause a disulfiram-like reaction (though rare with ceftriaxone).
- Concomitant use with calcium-containing IV solutions may lead to precipitation.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  B (Animal studies have not shown fetal harm, but there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.)
- Use only if clearly needed during pregnancy.
- **Breastfeeding:** Ceftriaxone and sulbactam are excreted in breast milk in low concentrations. Use with caution in nursing mothers. Monitor the infant for potential gastrointestinal effects.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Ceftriaxone inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis; sulbactam inhibits beta-lactamases.
- **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, nausea, rash, injection site reactions (common); severe allergic reactions, *C. difficile* infection, hepatic dysfunction (serious).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to cephalosporins or penicillins.
- **Drug Interactions:** Probenecid, oral contraceptives, calcium-containing solutions.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category B; use with caution during breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** See detailed dosage guidelines above.

## **Popular Combinations**


Ceftriaxone/sulbactam is often used alone, but in specific clinical scenarios, it might be used in conjunction with other antibiotics depending on the identified pathogen.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess for allergies to beta-lactam antibiotics, monitor renal and liver function, and observe for signs of superinfection (e.g., *C. difficile*).
- **Specific Populations:** Use cautiously in pregnant and breastfeeding women, and adjust dosages for patients with renal impairment.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Advise patients to avoid alcohol during treatment due to the potential for disulfiram-like reactions.
