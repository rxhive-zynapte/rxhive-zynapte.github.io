## **Usage**

Ceftriaxone + Vancomycin is a combination of two antibiotics used to treat serious bacterial infections, particularly those caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. This combination is effective against infections like severe respiratory tract infections (including pneumonia), complicated skin and soft tissue infections, bone and joint infections (such as osteomyelitis), intra-abdominal infections, urinary tract infections, bacterial sepsis and septic shock, bacterial meningitis, and as prophylaxis for endocarditis in high-risk patients undergoing dental procedures.  It's also used for surgical prophylaxis and in intensive care settings.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic

**Mechanism of Action:** Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins.  Vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, also inhibits cell wall synthesis but through a different mechanism; it binds to the D-alanyl-D-alanine terminus of peptidoglycan precursors, preventing their incorporation into the cell wall. The combined action provides broad-spectrum coverage.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no official alternate name for this specific combination. Individually, ceftriaxone is sometimes known as Rocephin (a brand name), and vancomycin is also available under various generic and brand names.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Both ceftriaxone and vancomycin disrupt bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death.  Ceftriaxone binds to specific penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), while vancomycin targets the D-alanyl-D-alanine residues of peptidoglycan precursors.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Ceftriaxone is well-absorbed after intramuscular administration and achieves therapeutic concentrations in various tissues and fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid. It's primarily excreted through the kidneys.  Vancomycin is poorly absorbed orally and typically administered intravenously for systemic infections. It's also excreted primarily through the kidneys.

**Elimination Pathways:** Both drugs are primarily eliminated via renal excretion. Dose adjustments are necessary for patients with renal impairment.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 1-2 g of ceftriaxone once daily (or divided every 12 hours) IV or IM, plus vancomycin dosed according to renal function (typically 15-20 mg/kg IV every 8-12 hours). For severe infections, ceftriaxone dose can be increased up to 4 g/day and vancomycin dosed based on trough levels and AUC monitoring.

#### **Children:** Ceftriaxone dosing depends on the infection and the child's weight, ranging from 50-100 mg/kg/day IV/IM once daily or divided every 12 hours, not to exceed 4 g/day.  Vancomycin is generally 10-15 mg/kg IV every 6-8 hours in children, with adjustments for neonates.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Adjust vancomycin based on renal function. Ceftriaxone generally doesn't require adjustment unless renal impairment is also present.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Both drugs require dose reductions.  Vancomycin requires careful monitoring and dose calculation based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Ceftriaxone adjustments may be needed in severe hepatic impairment. Monitor liver function tests.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider drug interactions and monitor relevant parameters (e.g., coagulation status, electrolyte levels).


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing in these settings should follow standard guidelines with potential adjustments based on patient specific factors:

* **Intubation:** Standard dosing.
* **Surgical Procedures:** Prophylactic use: 1g Ceftriaxone 30-60 minutes prior to incision + vancomycin (if indicated).
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** Standard dosing.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Standard or adjusted dosing based on patient and infection characteristics.
* **Emergency Situations:** Initial doses as per standard guidance, followed by adjustments based on clinical response and cultures.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Modifications are necessary for renal and hepatic impairment and based on therapeutic drug monitoring, particularly for vancomycin.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, rash, injection site reactions, pain, phlebitis.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
* **Ceftriaxone:** Seizures, pseudomembranous colitis, severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).
* **Vancomycin:** Nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity (hearing loss), “red man syndrome” (infusion reaction), neutropenia, thrombocytopenia.

### **Long-Term Effects:** Long-term use of vancomycin can increase the risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (rare), toxic epidermal necrolysis (rare).


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to ceftriaxone, vancomycin, or other beta-lactam antibiotics.
* Concurrent IV calcium administration with ceftriaxone in neonates.
* Premature infants.
* Severe renal impairment (vancomycin).
* History of vancomycin-induced thrombocytopenia.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Ceftriaxone:** Avoid concomitant use of IV calcium in neonates. Increased risk of bleeding with anticoagulants.
* **Vancomycin:** Increased risk of nephrotoxicity with other nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides, NSAIDs).  Increased risk of ototoxicity with other ototoxic drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides).
* **Both:**  Interactions with other drugs metabolized by the liver should be monitored.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Ceftriaxone is generally considered safe during pregnancy (Pregnancy Category B). Vancomycin use in pregnancy is reserved for serious infections where benefits outweigh risks. Both drugs are excreted in breast milk; caution is advised during breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

Please refer to the detailed information above for mechanism of action, side effects, contraindications, drug interactions, pregnancy and breastfeeding considerations, and dosage information.

**Monitoring Parameters:**  Renal function tests (BUN, creatinine), liver function tests, complete blood count, vancomycin trough levels (if applicable), and clinical response to treatment.


## **Popular Combinations**

While ceftriaxone and vancomycin are often used together, the combination isn't an official fixed-dose combination. They may be given alongside other antibiotics, depending on the identified or suspected pathogen, such as metronidazole for anaerobic infections.

## **Precautions**

* Evaluate renal and hepatic function prior to and during therapy, especially for vancomycin.
* Monitor for signs of hypersensitivity reactions.
* Infuse vancomycin slowly to minimize infusion reactions.
* Consider drug interactions.
* Perform therapeutic drug monitoring for vancomycin when indicated.
