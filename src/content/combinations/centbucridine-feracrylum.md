## **Usage**

Centbucridine + Feracrylum is a topical gel used for the management of minor cuts, burns, abrasions, and wound infections.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Hemostatic agent, antiseptic, and local anesthetic.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Feracrylum promotes coagulation by forming a complex with albumin, creating a scaffold for clot formation, and acting as an antiseptic. Centbucridine provides local anesthetic action by blocking pain signals and also possesses broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity.

## **Alternate Names**

- Hemolock AR Gel
- Sepgard AR Gel
- Supraheal AR Gel

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Feracrylum acts as a topical hemostatic and antiseptic agent, promoting clot formation and preventing infection. Centbucridine acts as a local anesthetic, blocking nerve conduction and providing pain relief, and also exhibits antimicrobial properties.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Both Feracrylum and Centbucridine have minimal systemic absorption when applied topically due to the high molecular weight of Feracrylum and the localized action of Centbucridine.  The specific metabolic pathways and elimination routes for this combined topical application are not well-studied.

- **Mode of Action:**
    - Feracrylum forms complexes with albumin in the blood, creating a scaffold to accelerate blood clotting. It acts as an antiseptic through mechanisms that are not fully elucidated, preventing or inhibiting the growth of microorganisms. 
    - Centbucridine blocks sodium channels in nerve fibers, inhibiting nerve impulse conduction, thus producing local anesthesia. It possesses broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against gram-positive, gram-negative bacteria and fungi, through a mechanism not fully described.

- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Feracrylum activates thrombin, facilitating the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, essential for clot formation. Centbucridine inhibits sodium channels, leading to a reduction in pain signals. Specific receptors are not known in their mechanisms of action.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Due to minimal systemic absorption of both drugs when used topically, the elimination pathways are not well-studied.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer of the gel to the cleaned and dried affected area once or twice daily.

#### **Children:** Use with caution in children. Consult a doctor for appropriate dosage and guidelines for pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required, but monitoring for potential skin irritation is advised.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically needed due to minimal systemic absorption. However, caution is advised.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically needed due to minimal systemic absorption. However, caution is advised.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Patients with known allergies to Centbucridine or Feracrylum, or those taking epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA), should not use this medication.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources do not offer specific dosage recommendations for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. This combination is primarily intended for minor wounds. Consult specialized resources for appropriate management of complex or major wounds.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are not typically necessary based on renal or hepatic function due to minimal systemic absorption.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Burning sensation at the application site
- Skin irritation (redness, itching, swelling)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (e.g., rash, hives, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing, anaphylaxis)

### **Long-Term Effects**

No long-term effects have been reported with topical use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Anaphylaxis (rare)



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to Centbucridine or Feracrylum
- Concomitant use of epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA)


## **Drug Interactions**

- Epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA): Avoid concomitant use due to potential interference with Feracrylum's hemostatic action.
- Other local anesthetics: Additive effects may occur. Use with caution.
- Medications affecting cardiac conduction: Use caution when administering Centbucridine concurrently with these medications.

No known significant drug-food interactions.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of Centbucridine + Feracrylum during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been definitively established. Use with caution and under medical supervision only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Consult a doctor before use.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Feracrylum: Hemostatic and antiseptic. Centbucridine: Local anesthetic and antimicrobial.
- **Side Effects:** Burning sensation, skin irritation, allergic reactions (rare).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to components, concomitant EACA use.
- **Drug Interactions:** EACA, other local anesthetics, drugs affecting cardiac conduction.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution under medical supervision.
- **Dosage:** Apply a thin layer to the affected area once or twice daily.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Wound healing, signs of infection, allergic reactions.

## **Popular Combinations**

No specific popular drug combinations are mentioned for this particular combination. However, it is sometimes found in combination with other antiseptics or wound healing agents.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Cleanse the wound before application. Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Discontinue use if persistent irritation occurs.

- **Specific Populations:**
    - **Pregnant Women:** Use with caution under medical supervision.
    - **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Consult a doctor before use.
    - **Children & Elderly:** Use with caution in children. Monitor elderly patients for skin irritation.
