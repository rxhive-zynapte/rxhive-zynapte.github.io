## **Usage**

Cetalkonium Chloride + Choline Salicylate is prescribed for the relief of pain, discomfort, and inflammation caused by a variety of oral conditions:

*   Mouth ulcers (aphthous ulcers, canker sores)
*   Cold sores (fever blisters)
*   Denture irritation
*   Sore spots from braces or orthodontic devices
*   Gum swelling
*   Teething pain (in infants over 4 months with specific formulations)

**Pharmacological Classification:**

*   Analgesic
*   Anti-inflammatory
*   Antiseptic

**Mechanism of Action:**

Choline salicylate, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), works by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, thus reducing pain and inflammation.  Cetalkonium chloride is an antiseptic quaternary ammonium compound that exhibits bactericidal activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, helping to prevent or treat secondary infections.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is marketed under various brand names, including:

*   Bonjela
*   Drujela
*   Teejel
*   Avera Gel
*   Pansoral Gel
    
## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

Choline salicylate exerts its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects primarily through the inhibition of prostaglandin production. Cetalkonium chloride acts as a topical antiseptic, disrupting bacterial cell membranes and causing cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

Choline salicylate is absorbed through the mucous membranes of the mouth. It is then metabolized primarily in the liver through conjugation with glycine and glucuronic acid. Both metabolites and a small amount of unchanged choline salicylate are excreted mainly in urine. The plasma half-life of salicylic acid (the active metabolite) is 2-4 hours. Cetalkonium chloride, due to its quaternary ammonium structure, has limited systemic absorption following topical application.

**Mode of Action:**

Choline salicylate inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, responsible for prostaglandin synthesis.  Prostaglandins mediate pain, inflammation, and fever.  By inhibiting COX, choline salicylate reduces these symptoms. Cetalkonium chloride acts as a cationic surfactant, disrupting bacterial cell membranes, leading to leakage of cellular contents and bacterial death.

**Elimination Pathways:**

Choline salicylate is primarily eliminated through renal excretion following hepatic metabolism.  Cetalkonium chloride is minimally absorbed systemically and therefore, primarily eliminated through the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply approximately 1 cm of gel (pea size for children 4-16) to the affected area every 3 hours, not exceeding 6 doses in 24 hours.

#### **Children:**

*   Over 4 months (for teething pain): Apply 0.5 cm of gel to the affected area every 3 hours. Some formulations, like Bonjela Teething Gel, are specifically designed for infants and children. *Do not use in infants under 4 months.*
* Over 16 years (for other oral conditions): Follow adult dosing guidelines. Do not use adult formulations in children under 16 years old due to the risk of Reye's syndrome.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is typically required.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically needed for topical use.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Exercise caution, although minimal systemic absorption is expected with topical application.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Patients with active peptic ulcers should not use this medication. For those with bleeding disorders or taking anticoagulants, consult a physician before use.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources focus on the use of Cetalkonium Chloride + Choline Salicylate for the management of common oral mucosal lesions. There's no specific information about dosage adjustments for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be required based on the specific formulation and the age of the patient. Consult specialized resources for dosage adjustments related to renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Generally, this medication is well-tolerated when used topically. A transient tingling sensation may be felt upon application.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), though rare, may occur.  Excessive use can lead to salicylate toxicity.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

No specific long-term adverse effects have been reported with topical use as directed.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) require immediate medical attention. Signs of salicylate toxicity (nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, confusion, hyperventilation) warrant discontinuation and medical evaluation.

## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to salicylates, cetalkonium chloride, or any of the excipients.
*   Active peptic ulcer.
*   Children and adolescents under 16 years of age (due to the risk of Reye's syndrome, especially with viral illnesses like chickenpox or influenza).

## **Drug Interactions**

*   Salicylates may enhance the effects of anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin).
*   Salicylates may inhibit the action of uricosuric agents (e.g., probenecid).
*   Concomitant use with other salicylates (e.g., aspirin) should be avoided unless under medical supervision.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Limited data are available on the safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Consult a healthcare professional before using during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester.  Short-term use during breastfeeding is generally considered safe if used as directed, but prolonged or excessive use should be avoided.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:**  Choline salicylate: NSAID inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis; Cetalkonium chloride: Antiseptic disrupting bacterial cell membranes.
*   **Side Effects:** Transient tingling sensation, rare allergic reactions, potential for salicylate toxicity with excessive use.
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, active peptic ulcer, children under 16.
