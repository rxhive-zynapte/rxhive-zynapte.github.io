## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the short-term symptomatic relief of common cold and flu symptoms, including dry cough, sneezing, runny nose, watery eyes, nasal congestion, and throat irritation. It is also used to alleviate symptoms associated with allergies and other upper respiratory illnesses.

**Pharmacological Classification**: This is a combination product containing drugs from multiple classes:

* **Cetirizine:** Antihistamine (H1 receptor antagonist)
* **Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** Cough suppressant (antitussive)
* **Phenylephrine:** Decongestant (alpha-1 adrenergic agonist)
* **Menthol:** Topical analgesic and cooling agent

## **Alternate Names**

There is no single international non-proprietary name (INN) for this combination. It is referred to by its component drugs. Brand names vary regionally and include Kozifed Plus, Indikof A, and others. Several manufacturers market this combination under different trade names.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Cetirizine:** Competitively inhibits histamine binding at H1 receptors, reducing allergic symptoms.
* **Dextromethorphan:** Suppresses the cough reflex by acting on the cough center in the medulla oblongata.
* **Phenylephrine:** Causes vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa by stimulating alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, reducing nasal congestion.
* **Menthol:** Activates TRPM8 receptors, producing a cooling sensation and relieving minor throat irritation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

The pharmacokinetic parameters (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination) for this specific combination may vary based on the formulation. Generally, these drugs are absorbed orally, with varying degrees of first-pass metabolism. Cetirizine is primarily excreted unchanged in urine. Dextromethorphan is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6.  Phenylephrine is metabolized by monoamine oxidase in the gastrointestinal tract and liver. Menthol is metabolized in the liver.
