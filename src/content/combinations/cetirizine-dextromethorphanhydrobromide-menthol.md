## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily used for the symptomatic relief of dry cough associated with the common cold and allergies. It is also used to alleviate symptoms such as runny nose, sneezing, itchy eyes, and throat irritation.  It combines the effects of an antihistamine (Cetirizine), a cough suppressant (Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide), and a topical anesthetic/cooling agent (Menthol).  Pharmacologically, it is classified as an upper respiratory combination product containing an antihistamine, antitussive, and counterirritant.

## **Alternate Names**

This specific combination does not have an official international nonproprietary name (INN). It is often referred to by its component names or by various brand names depending on the manufacturer and regional market. Some brand names containing these three ingredients include Kozifed Plus and variations thereof.  Several similar combination products exist containing related drugs.

## **How It Works**

**Cetirizine:** This antihistamine acts as an H1-receptor antagonist, blocking the effects of histamine, a chemical mediator responsible for allergic symptoms.

**Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide:** This antitussive acts centrally on the cough center in the medulla oblongata to suppress the cough reflex.

**Menthol:** This counterirritant provides a cooling sensation and acts as a topical anesthetic, soothing throat irritation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Cetirizine is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations in about an hour.  It is metabolized to a lesser extent by the liver and primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Dextromethorphan is also well-absorbed following oral administration and is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6. It and its metabolites are mainly excreted in urine.  Menthol is absorbed from the mucous membranes and metabolized in the liver to glucuronide conjugates before urinary excretion.
