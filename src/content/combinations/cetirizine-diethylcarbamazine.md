      How does this medication work against filarial infections?**


      **A:** Diethylcarbamazine immobilizes the microfilariae, making them more
      susceptible to the host's immune defenses. It might also exhibit direct
      filaricidal activity and possess anti-inflammatory properties.  Cetirizine
      helps to control allergic reactions that can occur due to the parasite or
      the treatment.

## **Usage**

Cetirizine + Diethylcarbamazine is prescribed for the treatment of lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis), loiasis, and river blindness. It is also used in the treatment of eosinophilic lung.  This combination medication falls under the pharmacological classifications of antihistamine (cetirizine) and anthelmintic (diethylcarbamazine). Cetirizine works by blocking histamine H1 receptors, reducing allergic symptoms associated with parasitic infections. Diethylcarbamazine immobilizes and kills the microfilariae, and possibly adult worms, and also has anti-inflammatory properties.


## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for the combination product itself. However, it is crucial to be aware of various regional brand names such as Cetriplus and DI Plus.



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cetirizine, an H1 receptor antagonist, reduces vascular permeability, itching, and other allergic manifestations. Diethylcarbamazine immobilizes microfilariae, making them susceptible to the host's immune system.  It may also have some direct filaricidal action and additionally possesses anti-inflammatory properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Cetirizine is well-absorbed orally. Diethylcarbamazine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and widely distributed in the body. Both drugs are primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted mainly through the kidneys. Diethylcarbamazine metabolites may also be excreted in the urine.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard dosage for adults is generally a single tablet containing 300mg of diethylcarbamazine and 10mg of cetirizine taken once daily with food for 21 days.  However, the dose may vary depending on the specific parasitic infection and clinical response.

#### **Children:**

The combination is generally not recommended for children under 6 years of age.  For children over 6, the dosage needs to be carefully determined by a physician based on the child's weight and the specific condition being treated. Pediatric safety needs to be cautiously considered given the potential for adverse effects.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary in elderly patients with renal impairment.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised, and dosage modification may be required based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Liver function should be monitored. Dosage adjustments may be necessary in patients with significant hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  The presence of other medical conditions, especially seizure disorders or urinary retention, requires careful consideration and monitoring.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources do not specify dosages for clinical use cases such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. This combination is specifically indicated for certain parasitic infections and not generally used in these settings.  

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments should be made based on the patient's renal and hepatic function. Patients with severe renal impairment may require a reduced dose or avoidance of the drug altogether.




## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**
Headache, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, skin rash, fever.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Severe allergic reactions, vision changes (night blindness, tunnel vision, vision loss), impairment of liver function, worsening of seizures.

### **Long-Term Effects**

The potential long-term effects of this combination medication need to be monitored, particularly regarding vision changes with prolonged diethylcarbamazine use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs include severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hepatotoxicity, and seizures.



## **Contraindications**

Known hypersensitivity to either cetirizine or diethylcarbamazine, pregnancy, breastfeeding (unless benefits outweigh the risks as determined by a physician), severe renal impairment, urinary retention, seizure disorders.


## **Drug Interactions**

The combination may interact with other antihistamines, antidepressants (e.g., duloxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline), anticonvulsants (e.g., pregabalin, topiramate), narcotic analgesics (e.g., morphine, methadone, oxycodone), and antipsychotics (e.g., quetiapine).  Alcohol should be avoided as it may enhance the sedative effects of cetirizine.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

This combination is generally contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential risks to the fetus or infant.  If the use is deemed absolutely necessary during breastfeeding, careful monitoring of the infant is essential.

## **Popular Combinations**

Sometimes a corticosteroid might be prescribed in conjunction with Cetirizine + Diethylcarbamazine to manage severe inflammatory reactions associated with the death of microfilariae, particularly in cases of river blindness.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:**  Assess for allergies, renal/hepatic function, history of seizures, and urinary retention before initiating treatment.
* **Specific Populations:** Advise pregnant and breastfeeding women against use. Exercise caution in children and elderly individuals.
