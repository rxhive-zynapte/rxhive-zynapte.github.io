## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of the common cold and flu, including allergic rhinitis. It addresses symptoms such as runny nose, stuffy nose, sneezing, watery eyes, headache, fever, and body aches.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing drugs from multiple classes:

*   Cetirizine: Antihistamine (second-generation)
*   Paracetamol: Analgesic and Antipyretic
*   Phenylephrine: Decongestant (alpha-adrenergic agonist)
*   Zinc Gluconate:  Proposed immune system support (not fully established)

**Mechanism of Action:**

*   Cetirizine: Competitively inhibits H1 histamine receptors
*   Paracetamol: Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS
*   Phenylephrine: Stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors in the nasal mucosa, causing vasoconstriction and reducing congestion.
*   Zinc Gluconate: Exact antiviral mechanism is not fully understood, but it is believed to interfere with viral replication.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination doesn't have an official international non-proprietary name. It is often referenced by its components (Cetirizine-Paracetamol-Phenylephrine-Zinc Gluconate) or various brand names. Some examples of brand names include Tuscold, Zincold Plus,  and Codylex CC, though there might be others.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The combined effects of cetirizine, paracetamol, and phenylephrine provide relief from cold, flu and allergy symptoms.  Zinc gluconate is included for its purported immune-boosting properties, although the scientific evidence for this is still under investigation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** All components are absorbed orally. Paracetamol's absorption can be affected by food intake.
*   **Metabolism:** Paracetamol is primarily metabolized by the liver, phenylephrine and cetirizine undergo hepatic and renal elimination, and zinc gluconate is distributed throughout the body.
*   **Elimination:**  Paracetamol and its metabolites are eliminated primarily through the kidneys. Cetirizine is excreted mostly unchanged in the urine. Phenylephrine is primarily metabolized in the liver and the gastrointestinal tract and is eliminated as sulfate or glucuronide. Zinc Gluconate is mostly eliminated in faeces.


## **Dosage**

Dosage depends on the formulation, patient age, and condition. Always adhere to the prescribing physician's instructions.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

A typical adult dose is a tablet or syrup containing 5 mg cetirizine, 500 mg paracetamol, and 5 mg phenylephrine, along with 7.5mg zinc gluconate, every 6-8 hours as needed. The maximum daily dose is determined by the doctor.

#### **Children:**

Pediatric dosage depends on weight or age and should be determined by a healthcare professional. Pediatric syrup formulations are commonly used.


#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments might be necessary due to age-related decline in hepatic and renal function.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is required based on creatinine clearance.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, and dose adjustments may be needed.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful evaluation is crucial, especially for patients with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, or thyroid issues.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources focus on the use of this combination for common cold and allergy symptoms.  There is no mention of use in specific clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments should be based on patient factors like renal/hepatic dysfunction and other medical conditions.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, headache, dry mouth, fatigue, stomach upset, restlessness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), liver damage (with excessive paracetamol use), cardiac arrhythmias (with phenylephrine).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Avoid prolonged use unless directed by a physician. Chronic paracetamol use can cause liver damage, and long-term phenylephrine use can lead to rebound congestion.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Rare but severe ADRs include severe allergic reactions, hepatotoxicity, and cardiovascular events.

## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to any component
*   Severe liver or kidney disease
*   Severe hypertension or coronary artery disease
