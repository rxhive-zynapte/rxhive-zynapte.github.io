## **Usage**

Cetirizine + Paracetamol is prescribed for the relief of symptoms associated with common cold, flu, and allergies, including fever, headache, body aches, runny nose, sneezing, watery eyes, and itching.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Cetirizine: Second-generation antihistamine (H1 receptor antagonist)
* Paracetamol: Analgesic and antipyretic

**Mechanism of Action:**

Cetirizine competes with histamine for H1-receptor sites on effector cells in the respiratory tract, blood vessels, and gastrointestinal tract, reducing the negative effects of histamine release. Paracetamol inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the central nervous system, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, thereby decreasing pain and fever.


## **Alternate Names**

There is no internationally recognized non-proprietary name for this specific fixed-dose combination.  It may be referred to by the names of its components, Cetirizine and Paracetamol (or Acetaminophen in the US).

**Brand Names:**  Brand names vary regionally. Some examples include (note this list is not exhaustive, and availability differs by region):

* Zyrtec-D (when combined with pseudoephedrine, not paracetamol)
* Several generic formulations


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cetirizine reduces the effects of histamine, resulting in decreased vascular permeability, reduced itching, and relief from sneezing and rhinorrhea. Paracetamol acts centrally to reduce fever and pain by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Cetirizine:** Cetirizine is well-absorbed orally. Peak plasma levels occur in about 1 hour. It is minimally metabolized and primarily excreted unchanged in urine.
* **Paracetamol:** Paracetamol is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak plasma concentration is reached within 30-60 minutes. It is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by glucuronidation and sulfation, and excreted in urine. A minor pathway involves metabolism by CYP2E1 to a reactive metabolite,  N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), which is detoxified by glutathione.


**Mode of Action:** Cetirizine acts as a competitive antagonist at the H1-receptor.  Paracetamol inhibits COX enzymes, primarily COX-2, in the central nervous system, leading to decreased prostaglandin production.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Cetirizine is mainly eliminated unchanged via renal excretion. Paracetamol is metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine as conjugates.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The typical adult dose is one tablet containing 5 mg cetirizine and 500 mg paracetamol, taken every 12 hours as needed.  Do not exceed 10mg of cetirizine or 4000 mg of paracetamol per 24 hour period.


#### **Children:**

* **6-11 years:**  5 mg cetirizine + appropriate dose of paracetamol (based on child's weight, typically 10-15 mg/kg every 4-6 hours)
* **2-5 years:** 2.5 mg cetirizine + appropriate dose of paracetamol (based on child's weight, typically 10-15 mg/kg every 4-6 hours)
* **1-2 years:** Cetirizine dosage should be determined by the doctor based on the child's weight and age. Paracetamol should be dosed according to the child's weight (10-15 mg/kg every 4-6 hours).
* **Under 1 year:**  Not recommended without doctor consultation.  

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Start with a lower dose of Cetirizine (5 mg daily), and adjust as needed. Monitor for adverse effects. Paracetamol dosing should generally remain the same, but renal and hepatic function should be considered.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment of cetirizine may be necessary. Consult current guidelines for specific recommendations based on creatinine clearance or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Paracetamol dosage may need adjustment in severe renal impairment.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Paracetamol dosage should be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment. Cetirizine dosage may need adjustment depending on the severity of liver dysfunction.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with asthma, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, glaucoma, and prostatic hypertrophy.  Closely monitor for adverse effects.



### **Clinical Use Cases**  

Cetirizine + Paracetamol is not typically used in the contexts of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  It's indicated for symptomatic relief of cold and allergy symptoms.  Other medications are more appropriate for the stated clinical use cases.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are necessary for renal or hepatic impairment and should be based on individual patient factors.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth
* Headache
* Nausea
* Fatigue



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Hepatotoxicity (with paracetamol overdose)

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term, high doses of paracetamol can increase the risk of liver damage.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) are rare but serious ADRs requiring immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to cetirizine or paracetamol
* Severe hepatic impairment
* Severe renal impairment


## **Drug Interactions**

* Alcohol (increases the risk of hepatotoxicity with paracetamol and drowsiness with cetirizine)
* Other CNS depressants (additive sedative effects)
* MAO inhibitors (may potentiate the effects of cetirizine)



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Cetirizine is generally considered safe during pregnancy, although other antihistamines like loratadine may be preferred due to more data available.  Paracetamol is also generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding at recommended doses.  However, consult the latest guidelines and individual patient factors before prescribing.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Cetirizine: H1-receptor antagonist; Paracetamol: COX inhibitor

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe hepatic/renal impairment
* **Drug Interactions:** Alcohol, CNS depressants, MAO inhibitors
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Generally safe, but consult guidelines
