## **Usage**

Cetirizine + Pseudoephedrine is prescribed for the temporary relief of symptoms associated with seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis, such as nasal and sinus congestion, sneezing, runny nose, itching, and watery eyes.  It combines the effects of an antihistamine (cetirizine) and a decongestant (pseudoephedrine).

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This drug is a combination product belonging to the following classifications:
    - **Antihistamine (Cetirizine):**  H1 receptor antagonist
    - **Decongestant (Pseudoephedrine):**  Alpha-adrenergic agonist.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Cetirizine works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergic symptoms. Pseudoephedrine works by constricting blood vessels in the nasal passages, which reduces swelling and congestion.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication may also be known as:

- Cetirizine-Pseudoephedrine
- Cetirizine Dihydrochloride and Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets


- **Brand Names:**  Zyrtec-D, REACTINE COMPLETE, All Day Allergy-D,  Allergy D-12, Allergy Relief Nasal Decongestant, Goodsense Cetirizine D-12 Hour,  KS Aller-Tec D-12, Wal-Zyr D, Leader Allergy Relief D



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Cetirizine exerts its effect by competitively inhibiting the binding of histamine to H1 receptors.  Pseudoephedrine acts as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, causing vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa, which reduces nasal congestion.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - **Absorption:** Both cetirizine and pseudoephedrine are rapidly absorbed after oral administration.  Food may slightly delay the absorption of cetirizine but doesn't affect its overall bioavailability.
    - **Metabolism:**  Cetirizine undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism.  Pseudoephedrine is partially metabolized in the liver by N-demethylation to norpseudoephedrine.
    - **Elimination:** Cetirizine is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.  Pseudoephedrine is also mainly eliminated through renal excretion, both as the parent compound and its metabolite. The elimination half-life of cetirizine is around 8 hours, while pseudoephedrine's half-life is 3-6 hours in acidic urine and 9-16 hours in alkaline urine.
- **Mode of Action (Cellular/Molecular):**  Cetirizine selectively binds to peripheral H1 receptors, preventing histamine from binding and triggering the cascade of events leading to allergic symptoms.  Pseudoephedrine stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle in the nasal mucosa, resulting in vasoconstriction.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Cetirizine acts as an H1 receptor antagonist. Pseudoephedrine is an alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily renal excretion for both cetirizine and pseudoephedrine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (12 years and older):** One extended-release tablet every 12 hours. Do not exceed two tablets in 24 hours.

#### **Children (4 to 11 years):** The combination of cetirizine and pseudoephedrine is generally not recommended. Consult a physician for dosing instructions for individual components if necessary.  Children younger than 4 years of age should not receive the combination medication.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients (65 years and older):**  Start with one tablet once daily; may increase to one tablet every 12 hours if needed and tolerated. Consider renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment is necessary.  For moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), one tablet daily is recommended.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustment is necessary. For moderate to severe hepatic impairment, one tablet daily is recommended.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, or prostatic hypertrophy.  Individualized dosing may be necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Cetirizine + Pseudoephedrine is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU. Its primary indication is for the relief of allergy and cold symptoms in an outpatient setting. It is not typically indicated for emergency situations such as status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are essential for elderly patients, patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and those with certain comorbid conditions like cardiovascular disease or diabetes.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Dry mouth
- Drowsiness or unusual sleepiness
- Fatigue
- Dizziness
- Headache
- Insomnia
- Trouble concentrating
- Nausea, stomach pain, constipation
- Nervousness



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions (hives, difficulty breathing, swelling)
- Cardiac arrhythmias (fast, pounding, or uneven heartbeat)
- Hypertension (severe headache, buzzing in the ears, chest pain)
- Tremors, severe restlessness, hyperactivity
- Difficulty urinating
- Confusion, hallucinations, psychosis
- Seizures, stroke, myocardial infarction




### **Long-Term Effects:**

Prolonged use can lead to rebound congestion with pseudoephedrine.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

See "Rare but Serious Side Effects."


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to cetirizine, pseudoephedrine, or hydroxyzine
- Narrow-angle glaucoma
- Urinary retention
- Severe hypertension or coronary artery disease
- Concurrent or recent (within 14 days) use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)
- Uncontrolled hyperthyroidism
- Severe arrhythmia

## **Drug Interactions**

- **CNS Depressants:**  Alcohol and other medications that cause drowsiness may enhance the sedative effects of cetirizine.
- **MAO Inhibitors:** Concurrent use is contraindicated and can lead to a hypertensive crisis.
- **Tricyclic Antidepressants:** May enhance the effects of pseudoephedrine.
- **Blood Pressure Medications:** Pseudoephedrine can potentially decrease the effectiveness of antihypertensive drugs.
- **Digoxin:**  Pseudoephedrine can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias in patients taking digoxin.
- **Stimulants and ADHD Medications:** Pseudoephedrine can have additive effects with other stimulants.
- **Antacids:** May increase pseudoephedrine absorption.
- **Kaolin:** May decrease pseudoephedrine absorption.
- **CYP450 Interactions:**  Cetirizine and pseudoephedrine have limited CYP450 interactions compared to other drugs. However, pseudoephedrine may affect the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  C
- **Fetal Risks:** The safety of this combination during pregnancy has not been established. Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus. Pseudoephedrine can decrease blood flow to the uterus.
