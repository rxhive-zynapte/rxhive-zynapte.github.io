## **Usage**

Cetrimide + Chlorhexidine Gluconate is prescribed for the cleansing and irrigation of skin and wounds, particularly dirty wounds. It is also used as a pre-operative skin disinfectant and for general skin hygiene to prevent infections.  Its pharmacological classifications are antiseptic and disinfectant.

The mechanism of action involves two components: Cetrimide disrupts bacterial cell membranes, and Chlorhexidine Gluconate binds to bacterial cell walls, altering permeability and causing leakage of cell contents. This combined action leads to bacterial cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is often referred to as Cetrimide-Chlorhexidine. Brand names include Savlon and Aquadine.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cetrimide, a cationic surfactant, disrupts the cell membranes of bacteria, causing cell death.  Chlorhexidine Gluconate, a bisbiguanide antiseptic, binds to the bacterial cell wall, increasing its permeability and leading to leakage of intracellular components. This dual action results in a broad-spectrum antimicrobial effect against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, some fungi, and viruses.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Primarily topical application; systemic absorption is minimal. When used as a mouthwash, approximately 30% is retained in the oral cavity and slowly released.  Elimination pathways are not well-characterized due to low systemic absorption.

**Mode of Action:** Cetrimide disrupts the lipid bilayer of bacterial cell membranes. Chlorhexidine Gluconate binds to negatively charged bacterial cell walls, disrupting their integrity.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation**: No significant interaction with receptors, enzymes, or neurotransmitters is known for topical applications.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a sufficient amount of solution to cover the affected area. For mouthwash, 15ml is typically used for 30 seconds twice daily.


#### **Children:**  Dosage should be determined by a healthcare professional, considering the child's age and weight.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required unless there is renal or hepatic impairment.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are usually unnecessary due to minimal systemic absorption.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Similar to renal impairment, dosage modifications are generally not required.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider specific conditions and potential drug interactions when determining dosage.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosage for clinical use cases is generally determined by the specific procedure and the area needing treatment. Always follow established protocols for each situation.

- **Intubation:** For endotracheal tube care, the concentration and frequency are determined by hospital guidelines.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Preoperative skin preparation involves applying the solution to the surgical site according to surgical protocols.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:**  Tracheostomy care, similar to intubation, involves applying the solution following hospital guidelines.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  Dosage and frequency are determined by the patient's specific needs and the ICU protocols.
- **Emergency Situations:** As directed by the attending physician, taking into consideration the situation and the patient's condition.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustment is not generally required due to the low systemic absorption of this combination.

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

- Skin irritation
- Itching
- Redness
- Rash
- Dry mouth (with oral use)
- Altered taste (with oral use)


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
- Chemical burns (especially in neonates)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Prolonged wound healing (with cetrimide)
- Tooth staining (with long-term oral chlorhexidine use)

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) requiring immediate medical attention.



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to cetrimide or chlorhexidine gluconate
- Use in body cavities (e.g., brain, meninges, eyes, perforated eardrum)
- Use on broken or irritated skin


## **Drug Interactions**

- Anionic compounds (e.g., soaps, some detergents) can inactivate the antiseptic effect.
- Avoid concomitant use with other topical antiseptics.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult a physician before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  While systemic absorption is minimal, potential risks to the fetus or neonate are not fully elucidated.  If used during breastfeeding, rinse nipples thoroughly before nursing.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Cetrimide disrupts bacterial cell membranes, while chlorhexidine gluconate alters bacterial cell wall permeability.

- **Side Effects:**  Skin irritation, itching, redness, rash, dry mouth (oral use), altered taste (oral use), rarely allergic reactions or chemical burns.

- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, use in body cavities, broken skin.

- **Drug Interactions:** Anionic compounds, other topical antiseptics.

- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Consult a physician before use.

- **Dosage:** Topical application as needed, or 15 ml oral rinse twice daily.

- **Monitoring Parameters:** Observe for signs of skin irritation, allergic reaction or delayed wound healing. Monitor for tooth staining with prolonged oral use.


## **Popular Combinations:**

Cetrimide and Chlorhexidine Gluconate are commonly combined for their synergistic antiseptic effects.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Test for sensitivity before widespread use.

- **Specific Populations:** Avoid use in neonates without strict medical supervision due to the risk of chemical burns.

- **Lifestyle Considerations:** No specific lifestyle considerations are necessary.
