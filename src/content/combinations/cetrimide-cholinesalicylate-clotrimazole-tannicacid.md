## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the treatment of oral thrush (oral candidiasis) and other oral infections. It is also used for nappy rash in babies.  It provides temporary relief from the pain and discomfort associated with mouth ulcers, cold sores, and irritation from orthodontic devices and dental procedures.  It can also help relieve symptoms of gum problems like gingivitis and periodontitis, ease discomfort from dental appliances, and promote better oral hygiene by reducing gum inflammation and irritation.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antiseptic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, and astringent.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Cetrimide acts as an antiseptic. Choline salicylate, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), delivers analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Clotrimazole exerts antifungal action. Tannic acid functions as an astringent, forming a protective layer on mucous membranes and promoting healing while also exhibiting antibacterial and antiviral properties.

## **Alternate Names**

- Clenorush Gel, Clenora Gel

- Brand names vary by manufacturer.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Cetrimide disrupts bacterial cell membranes. Choline salicylate reduces pain and inflammation. Clotrimazole alters fungal cell wall permeability, leading to cell death.  Tannic acid forms a protective layer over mucous membranes, reduces inflammation, and aids healing.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Choline salicylate is absorbed systematically after oral administration. The absorption and metabolism of the other components when applied topically in the mouth are less well-defined.  All components, or their metabolites, are primarily excreted through the kidneys.


- **Mode of Action:**  Cetrimide: Disrupts bacterial cell membranes, preventing their growth. Choline Salicylate: Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, reducing pain and inflammation. Clotrimazole: Alters fungal cell wall permeability, leading to cell death. Tannic Acid: Forms a protective layer over mucous membranes, reducing inflammation and promoting healing. It also exhibits antibacterial and antiviral effects.

- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**  Choline salicylate inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thus reducing prostaglandin synthesis.


- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**
