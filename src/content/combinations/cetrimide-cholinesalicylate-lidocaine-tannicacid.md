## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the topical treatment of mouth ulcers (aphthous ulcers) and other minor oral lesions, such as stomatitis (inflammation of the mouth) and glossitis (inflammation of the tongue). It can also provide relief from discomfort caused by orthodontic appliances or dental procedures.  It is not suitable for treating infected or weeping skin lesions.

It falls under the following pharmacological classifications:

* **Antiseptic:** Cetrimide kills bacteria and fungi.
* **Local anesthetic:** Lidocaine numbs the affected area.
* **Analgesic:** Choline salicylate and lidocaine relieve pain.
* **Anti-inflammatory:** Choline salicylate reduces inflammation.
* **Astringent:** Tannic acid shrinks and protects the ulcer.


This combination medication works by targeting different aspects of mouth ulcer treatment.  Cetrimide acts as an antiseptic, preventing infection. Choline salicylate, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), reduces pain and inflammation by blocking prostaglandin synthesis. Lidocaine provides local anesthetic action by blocking nerve impulses.  Tannic acid acts as an astringent, forming a protective layer over the ulcer to promote healing, and may also have some antibacterial and antiviral effects.


## **Alternate Names**

This combination doesn't have a universally recognized non-proprietary name. It's often referred to as "T-32 Gum Paint" or simply by the combination of its ingredients. Brand names include BI-Folate Mouth Ulcer Gel, Clenora Gel, Gumrest Gum Paint, and Oracin Gel.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  The combined effects of the ingredients contribute to pain relief, reduction of inflammation, and promotion of healing. Choline salicylate, an NSAID, inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, thereby reducing pain and inflammation. Lidocaine blocks nerve impulses, leading to local anesthesia. Tannic acid acts as an astringent and forms a protective barrier, promoting healing and reducing irritation.  Cetrimide's antiseptic action prevents secondary infections.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  As this medication is applied topically, systemic absorption is minimal.  Choline salicylate is absorbed to some extent through the oral mucosa. Lidocaine is absorbed slowly after topical application but its systemic effects are generally limited.  Tannic acid and cetrimide are not significantly absorbed. Metabolism and elimination pathways for the small amounts absorbed are hepatic (liver) and renal (kidney) respectively.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a small quantity of the gel/paint directly to the affected area 3-4 times daily.  Do not swallow the medication.

#### **Children:** Use in children under 16 is generally not recommended unless specifically prescribed by a doctor. Pediatric dosage guidelines must be determined on a case-by-case basis by a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**
