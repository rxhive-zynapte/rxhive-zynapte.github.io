## **Usage**

Cetrimide + Ketoconazole is prescribed for the topical treatment of fungal skin infections, including:

*   Tinea corporis (ringworm)
*   Tinea cruris (jock itch)
*   Tinea pedis (athlete's foot)
*   Tinea versicolor
*   Cutaneous candidiasis
*   Seborrheic dermatitis
*   Dandruff

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antifungal and Antiseptic

**Mechanism of Action:** Ketoconazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis, a critical component of fungal cell membranes, leading to fungal cell death. Cetrimide is an antiseptic that disrupts the cell membranes of bacteria, fungi, and viruses, causing cell death. It also has anti-inflammatory properties.

## **Alternate Names**

*   Ketoconazole + Cetrimide
*   KETLIMAC
*   KETASO-CM
*   Zilzip C
*   Ketostar
*   Ketodermis (brand name for soap formulation)

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ketoconazole exerts its antifungal effect by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes. This disruption alters membrane permeability and leads to fungal cell death. Cetrimide's antiseptic action stems from its ability to disrupt the cell membranes of various microorganisms.  Additionally, it possesses anti-inflammatory properties, contributing to the reduction of itching and redness associated with fungal infections.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Topical application results in minimal systemic absorption. The drug primarily exerts its effects locally at the site of application.

**Mode of Action:** Ketoconazole targets the fungal cell membrane by inhibiting the enzyme lanosterol 14Î±-demethylase, responsible for ergosterol synthesis. This inhibition disrupts the integrity of the fungal cell membrane, resulting in cell death. Cetrimide, as a quaternary ammonium compound, directly interacts with the cell membranes of microorganisms, leading to their disruption and death.

**Elimination Pathways:** Due to minimal systemic absorption, elimination pathways are not clinically significant for topical application.


## **Dosage**

Cetrimide + Ketoconazole is available as a topical cream, lotion, or soap.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a thin layer to the affected area(s) once or twice daily, or as directed by a physician.  For soap formulations, use daily during bathing. Lather and leave on the skin for a few minutes before rinsing thoroughly.

#### **Children:**

Use in children should be directed by a physician. Dosage depends on the child's age, weight, and the specific condition being treated.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are typically required. However, close monitoring for adverse effects is recommended.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustments are generally necessary due to minimal systemic absorption.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Systemic absorption is low; however, caution is advised, especially with prolonged use or if large areas of skin are treated.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with open wounds or severely damaged skin, as increased absorption may occur.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific medical settings is generally the same as the standard dosage. There are no specific recommendations for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modification is rarely needed due to minimal systemic absorption following topical application. However, individual patient characteristics (e.g., the size of the affected skin areas, presence of open wounds) or specific medical conditions should be considered.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Skin irritation
*   Burning sensation
*   Dry skin
*   Itching
*   Rash

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Allergic reactions (e.g., contact dermatitis)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

No specific long-term effects are typically associated with topical use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Contact dermatitis or other hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of treatment.

## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to ketoconazole, cetrimide, or any inactive ingredients.
*   Open wounds or broken skin (for cream/lotion formulations).
*   Application to mucous membranes.

## **Drug Interactions**

No significant drug interactions are expected with topical application.  However, inform your physician about all other topical medications used on the same area to avoid potential interactions or additive effects.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult with a physician before using during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Limited data are available regarding the safety of topical ketoconazole and cetrimide during pregnancy and breastfeeding. While topical application results in minimal systemic absorption, it is essential to exercise caution and assess the potential risks versus benefits.
