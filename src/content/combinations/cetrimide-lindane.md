## **Usage**

Cetrimide + Lindane is a topical combination medication primarily prescribed for the treatment of **scabies** and **pediculosis** (lice infestation), including head lice and pubic lice.  It is classified as an **antiparasitic** and **antiseptic** agent.

The Cetrimide component acts as an antiseptic with bactericidal and fungicidal properties, disrupting the cell membranes of microorganisms.  Lindane is an insecticide that targets the nervous system of parasites like scabies mites and lice, causing seizures and death.

## **Alternate Names**

Lindane is also known as gamma benzene hexachloride. This combination medication is marketed under various brand names such as **Gbhc**, **Antiscab**, and **Lupiscab**. The specific brand names might vary regionally.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Cetrimide disrupts the cell membranes of bacteria and fungi. Lindane acts as a neurotoxin to insects, causing paralysis and death.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Cetrimide primarily exerts its effect topically. Lindane, although also applied topically, can be absorbed through the skin.  The extent of absorption is increased if applied to broken or irritated skin, or used for prolonged periods.  Lindane is metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Specific CYP enzyme interactions are not well-defined.

**Mode of Action:** Cetrimide acts by increasing the permeability of microbial cell membranes, leading to leakage of cellular contents and cell death.  Lindane interferes with the GABA-mediated chloride channels in the insect nervous system, leading to uncontrolled neuronal firing, seizures, and death.

**Elimination:** Cetrimide is primarily removed by washing off the application site. Absorbed Lindane is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in urine.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  A thin layer of lotion or cream is applied to the entire body from the neck down, including the soles of the feet. For shampoo formulations used for lice, apply to the affected area.  Typically, 30 mL is sufficient for an average adult, and up to 60 mL may be needed for larger individuals. The application is left on for 8-12 hours, then thoroughly washed off. Only a single application is recommended. Do not retreat without consulting a physician.

#### **Children:**  Use with extreme caution in children, especially those weighing less than 50 kg. Due to a higher surface area-to-volume ratio, children are at a higher risk of systemic absorption and neurotoxicity. The dosage should be determined by a physician based on the child's weight and the specific condition being treated. Use is not recommended for premature infants and neonates. For children older than 2 years, the doctor will decide the dose.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to potential age-related changes in skin integrity and organ function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Monitor for signs of toxicity.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution due to the potential for impaired metabolism of Lindane.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with extreme caution in patients with seizure disorders, pre-existing skin conditions (atopic dermatitis, psoriasis), or any condition that might increase the risk of seizures.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of Cetrimide + Lindane in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, and emergency situations is not indicated. Its use is restricted to topical treatment of scabies and lice infestations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and those with pre-existing skin conditions. Always consult with a physician for appropriate dosage adjustments.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Skin irritation (stinging, burning, itching, dryness, redness)
- Skin rash
- Dizziness
- Drowsiness

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Seizures
- Neurotoxicity (e.g., tremors, ataxia)
- Allergic reactions (e.g., hives, difficulty breathing)

### **Long-Term Effects:**
Chronic complications from prolonged use are rare if used as directed.  However, Lindane can persist in the body for extended periods, especially in adipose tissue.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
Seizures and severe neurotoxicity require immediate medical intervention.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to Cetrimide or Lindane
- Uncontrolled seizure disorders
- Premature infants and neonates
- Crusted scabies
- Widespread skin disease or burns

## **Drug Interactions**

- Medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., certain antidepressants, antipsychotics)
- Other topical medications

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Lindane is not recommended during pregnancy due to potential fetal risks, including neurodevelopmental effects.  It's also not recommended during breastfeeding due to potential excretion in breast milk and neonatal exposure.  Consult a physician for safer alternative treatments.
