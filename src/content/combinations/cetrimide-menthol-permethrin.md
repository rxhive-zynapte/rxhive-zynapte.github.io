## **Usage**

Cetrimide + Menthol + Permethrin is primarily prescribed for the treatment of **scabies** and **head lice infestations**. It can also be used for other skin infections or infestations, as determined by a doctor.

**Mechanism of Action:**

* **Permethrin:** Disrupts the sodium channels in the nerve cell membranes of parasites like scabies mites and lice, leading to paralysis and death.

* **Cetrimide:**  Acts as an antiseptic by disrupting bacterial cell membranes.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

**Mode of Action:**  (As described in *Usage* Section)
