## **Usage**

Cetrimide + Permethrin is primarily prescribed for the treatment of scabies and head lice infestations.  It can also be used for other skin infections or infestations, as determined by a doctor.  Cetrimide is an antiseptic and Permethrin is classified as a pyrethroid insecticide and scabicide.  The combination works by disrupting the cell membranes of bacteria and other microorganisms (Cetrimide's action), which helps prevent secondary skin infections. Permethrin interferes with the nervous system of parasites like scabies mites and lice, causing paralysis and death.


## **Alternate Names**

While "Cetrimide + Permethrin" is the standard generic name, some brand names include "Scabgen-C", "Permedin C", and "Lixofer C".  Other names may exist regionally.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cetrimide acts as a cationic surfactant, disrupting the cell membranes of bacteria and fungi. Permethrin interferes with sodium channels in the nerve cells of parasites, leading to their paralysis and death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Cetrimide, when applied topically, has limited systemic absorption. Permethrin, also applied topically, is poorly absorbed through the skin.  The absorbed portion is rapidly metabolized and excreted, primarily through the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** Cetrimide disrupts the cell membranes of microbes. Permethrin targets the parasite's nervous system by delaying the closure of sodium channels in nerve cell membranes. This prolonged sodium influx causes repetitive nerve firing and eventual paralysis.

**Elimination:**  The small amount of permethrin that is absorbed systemically is rapidly metabolized and excreted primarily via the kidneys.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer of 5% permethrin cream to the entire body from the neck down, including the soles of the feet and between fingers and toes.  Leave on for 8-14 hours, then wash off thoroughly.  A single application is usually sufficient, but a second application may be necessary after 7 days if live mites are still present. For head lice, apply 1% permethrin lotion or cream rinse to washed, towel-dried hair. Leave on for 10 minutes, then rinse and comb out nits. Repeat after 7 days if needed.


#### **Children:** For scabies in children 2 months and older, follow adult instructions. For children younger than 2 months, consult a doctor. For head lice, use 1% permethrin lotion/cream rinse as directed for adults. Supervise application in children.  


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Follow adult dosage. In addition, apply to the scalp, hairline, forehead, temples, and ears for scabies.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No dose adjustment is typically necessary for topical application.  However, caution should be exercised.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is typically necessary for topical application.  However, caution should be exercised.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider pre-existing skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis, as permethrin might exacerbate these.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  The primary clinical use cases are scabies and head lice infestations.  Use in intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations is not relevant for this medication.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are primarily based on age and body surface area. Always follow product-specific instructions.  For patients with pre-existing skin conditions or other comorbidities, careful assessment is required, and a physician should be consulted.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Itching, burning, stinging, tingling, redness, or rash at the application site.  Dry skin may also occur.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:** Allergic reactions (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat).  Seizures (rare, primarily with misuse or overdose).


### **Long-Term Effects:** No significant long-term adverse effects are typically associated with proper use of this medication.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Severe skin reactions, allergic reactions, or neurological effects (e.g., seizures) necessitate immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to permethrin, cetrimide, pyrethrins, chrysanthemums, or any component of the formulation. Infants under 2 months of age for over-the-counter formulations.  Premature infants. Patients with uncontrolled seizure disorders.




## **Drug Interactions**
