## **Usage**

Cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol are fatty alcohols primarily used in topical skincare and haircare products as an emollient, emulsifier, and thickening agent.  They are not classified as drugs in the traditional sense, meaning they do not have a pharmacological classification like antibiotic or analgesic, and are not prescribed for treating medical conditions. Instead, they enhance the texture and stability of cosmetic formulations.

## **Alternate Names**

- Cetearyl Alcohol
- Cetostearyl alcohol
- Cetylstearyl alcohol
- (C16-C18) alkyl alcohol
- Alcohol cetylis et stearylicus


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cetyl and stearyl alcohols work by forming a protective layer on the skin's surface, preventing water loss and maintaining skin hydration.  They also contribute to the smooth, creamy feel of products. These alcohols are not intended for systemic absorption.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  As these alcohols are for topical application and are not intended for systemic absorption, traditional pharmacokinetic parameters (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination) are not typically assessed. Minimal absorption through the skin is expected.

**Mode of Action:** Cetyl and stearyl alcohols act by forming a lipid barrier on the skin surface, reducing transepidermal water loss (TEWL) which keeps the skin hydrated and soft. They do not have specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation activity.


## **Dosage**

Cetyl and stearyl alcohols are used in cosmetic formulations, not as medications with prescribed dosages.  Their concentration in products typically ranges from 0.5% to 10%, depending on the desired product characteristics.
