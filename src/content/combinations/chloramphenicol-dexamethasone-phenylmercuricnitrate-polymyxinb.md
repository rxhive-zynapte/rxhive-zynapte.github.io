## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily used for eye infections and injuries.  It combines an antibiotic (chloramphenicol), an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid (dexamethasone), a preservative (phenyl mercuric nitrate), and another antibiotic (polymyxin B). This combination addresses bacterial infection, reduces inflammation, and aids in healing.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Chloramphenicol: Antibiotic (bacteriostatic)
* Dexamethasone: Corticosteroid (anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressant)
* Phenyl Mercuric Nitrate: Antiseptic, preservative
* Polymyxin B: Antibiotic (bactericidal)


## **Alternate Names**

There is no internationally recognized non-proprietary name for this specific combination.  It's typically referred to by the constituent drug names. Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region.


## **How It Works**

**Chloramphenicol:** Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit, preventing peptide bond formation. It is primarily bacteriostatic. Metabolized mainly by the liver and excreted renally.

**Dexamethasone:**  A synthetic glucocorticoid that exerts its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors.  This binding modulates gene expression, affecting various physiological processes like inflammation, immune response, and metabolism. Metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted in the urine.

**Phenyl Mercuric Nitrate:** Acts as a preservative and antiseptic. It disrupts the cell membrane of microorganisms, leading to their inactivation. Its pharmacokinetics are not extensively studied.

**Polymyxin B:**  A bactericidal antibiotic that acts by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane permeability. It binds to the lipid A portion of lipopolysaccharide in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, leading to leakage of cellular contents and cell death. Primarily excreted renally.



## **Dosage**

Dosage depends on the specific product formulation and the severity of the condition.  Always follow the instructions provided by the physician or on the product packaging.


### **Standard Dosage**  
#### **Adults:**  Usually, one or two drops are instilled into the affected eye(s) every few hours, as directed by the physician.

#### **Children:** Dosage in children should be determined and supervised by a physician, and it usually involves a reduced frequency or concentration compared to the adult dose.

#### **Special Cases:** Dosage adjustments might be necessary in elderly patients, those with renal or hepatic impairment, or with certain comorbid conditions.  Consult a specialist in such situations.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  
This combination isn't typically used in the listed clinical settings (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, emergency situations). It's primarily for topical ophthalmic use.



## **Side Effects**

### **Long-Term Effects**
Long-term use of topical corticosteroids like dexamethasone can increase the risk of cataracts, glaucoma, and secondary eye infections.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
