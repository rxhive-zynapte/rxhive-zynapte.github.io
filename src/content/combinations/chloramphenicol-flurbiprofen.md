## **Usage**

Chloramphenicol + Flurbiprofen is an ophthalmic solution primarily prescribed for bacterial eye infections, particularly conjunctivitis.  It combines an antibiotic and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Chloramphenicol: Antibiotic
* Flurbiprofen: Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID)

**Mechanism of Action:** Chloramphenicol inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, halting bacterial growth. Flurbiprofen inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, reducing inflammation, pain, and swelling.


## **Alternate Names**

Flubichlor Eye Drops


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Chloramphenicol exerts its bacteriostatic effect by binding to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, inhibiting peptidyl transferase and thus preventing peptide bond formation.  Flurbiprofen, like other NSAIDs, inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin production.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Both drugs are administered topically as eye drops. Chloramphenicol, when administered systemically, is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is metabolized primarily in the liver by glucuronidation and excreted in the urine. Flurbiprofen, when administered systemically, is well-absorbed orally, highly protein-bound, metabolized in the liver by CYP2C9, and excreted in urine. When applied topically to the eyes, small amounts of both drugs may be absorbed systemically.

**Mode of Action:**

* Chloramphenicol:  Ribosomal protein synthesis inhibition
* Flurbiprofen:  Cyclooxygenase inhibition

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for both drugs after systemic administration, following hepatic metabolism. Minimal systemic absorption after topical ophthalmic application.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Instill 1-2 drops into the affected eye(s) every 2 hours.

#### **Children:** Dosage should be determined by a pediatrician, considering age and weight. Monitor for bone marrow suppression, especially in neonates and premature infants.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Close monitoring for age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use cautiously in patients with bleeding disorders, peptic ulcers, or those on anticoagulants or NSAIDs.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Intubation:** Standard dosage.
* **Surgical Procedures:** Standard dosage, with post-surgical adjustments as needed.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** Standard dosage.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Standard dosage, adjusted as per patient condition.
* **Emergency Situations:** Standard dosage initially, followed by reassessment.


### **Dosage Adjustments:**  Modify dosage based on renal/hepatic function, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.


## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects:**

* Eye discomfort
* Eye irritation
* Burning sensation
* Blurred vision


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Aplastic anemia (Chloramphenicol - systemic use)
* Gray baby syndrome (Chloramphenicol - systemic use in neonates)



### **Long-Term Effects:** May include bone marrow suppression with prolonged systemic chloramphenicol use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Serious adverse reactions include blood dyscrasias (e.g. aplastic anemia) with chloramphenicol, especially with systemic administration.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to either drug
* History of blood dyscrasias (Chloramphenicol)
* Active ocular infections (Flurbiprofen)
* Severe dry eyes or compromised corneas (Flurbiprofen)
* Aspirin/NSAID allergy (Flurbiprofen)
* CABG surgery (Flurbiprofen)



## **Drug Interactions**

* Other topical eye medications
* Anticoagulants
* NSAIDs



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy:**  Use with caution.  Chloramphenicol can cause "gray baby syndrome" in newborns, particularly if administered near term. Flurbiprofen is contraindicated in the third trimester.

**Breastfeeding:** Use with caution.  Both drugs can be excreted in breast milk.  Monitor infants for adverse effects.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Chloramphenicol inhibits bacterial protein synthesis; Flurbiprofen inhibits prostaglandin synthesis.
* **Side Effects:** Eye discomfort, irritation, burning, blurred vision; rarely, aplastic anemia (Chloramphenicol).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, blood dyscrasias, active ocular infections, corneal issues, aspirin/NSAID allergy, CABG (Flurbiprofen).
* **Drug Interactions:** Other eye medications, anticoagulants, NSAIDs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution. Monitor for side effects.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 1-2 drops every 2 hours. Pediatric: consult pediatrician.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood count, liver and kidney function (especially with systemic chloramphenicol).



## **Popular Combinations**

The medication itself is a combination product. Combining it with other ophthalmic medications is usually not recommended without a specific clinical need, due to potential drug interactions. 


## **Precautions**

* Wash hands before and after use.
* Avoid dropper tip contamination.
* Monitor for blood dyscrasias with systemic chloramphenicol use.
* Avoid visually demanding tasks until blurred vision clears.
* Assess for pre-existing blood disorders, renal/hepatic impairment.
* Pregnancy/Breastfeeding: Use cautiously.
