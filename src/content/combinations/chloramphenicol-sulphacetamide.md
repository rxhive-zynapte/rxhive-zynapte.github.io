## **Usage**

Chloramphenicol + Sulphacetamide is primarily prescribed for the treatment of superficial bacterial eye infections, such as conjunctivitis (pink eye) and blepharitis. Its pharmacological classification is antibiotic.  The combination works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis (chloramphenicol) and interfering with bacterial folic acid synthesis (sulphacetamide), thereby halting bacterial growth.

## **Alternate Names**

While the generic name is Chloramphenicol + Sulphacetamide, brand names may vary depending on the region. Some examples include Chloramphenicol and Sulfacetamide ophthalmic, Chloroptic-S, and others.  It is often referred to simply as Chloramphenicol-Sulfacetamide.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Chloramphenicol acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of bacteria, preventing protein synthesis and leading to bacteriostatic action. Sulphacetamide, a sulfonamide, competes with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) in the folic acid synthesis pathway, which is essential for bacterial growth. The combination exhibits broad-spectrum activity against various gram-positive and gram-negative ocular pathogens.

**Pharmacokinetics:** When administered topically as eye drops or ointment, Chloramphenicol + Sulphacetamide achieves high concentrations in ocular tissues. Systemic absorption is minimal, reducing the risk of systemic side effects.  Chloramphenicol is metabolized by the liver, while sulfacetamide is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Some hepatic metabolism of sulfacetamide also occurs.

**Mode of Action:** Chloramphenicol targets the bacterial ribosome, specifically the 50S subunit. This binding interferes with peptide bond formation and inhibits protein synthesis. Sulphacetamide disrupts folic acid synthesis by mimicking PABA.  Folic acid is essential for bacterial cell division and DNA replication.

**Elimination Pathways:** The primary elimination pathway for chloramphenicol is hepatic metabolism, while sulfacetamide is mostly excreted unchanged by the kidneys.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Instill 1-2 drops of solution or apply a small amount (about 1/2 inch ribbon) of ointment into the affected eye(s) every 2-3 hours initially, then every 3-4 hours. For ointment, application at bedtime is also advised.


#### **Children (≥2 months):**  Similar to adult dosing.  Instill 1-2 drops of solution or apply a small amount (about 1/2 inch ribbon) of ointment into the affected eye(s) every 2-3 hours initially, then every 3-4 hours.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically necessary unless renal or hepatic impairment is present.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution should be exercised, and dosage adjustment may be required for moderate to severe renal impairment due to the renal excretion of sulfacetamide.


* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment due to the metabolism of chloramphenicol and sulfacetamide.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is recommended for patients with a history of blood dyscrasias or bone marrow suppression, particularly with prolonged use.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosage for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations typically mirrors the standard adult dosage.  However, the frequency of administration may be increased in some cases depending on the severity of infection and as directed by a healthcare professional.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments should be made on a patient-specific basis and are based on renal function, hepatic function, and other relevant comorbidities.  Close monitoring for adverse effects is essential.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

* Transient burning or stinging upon instillation
* Temporary blurred vision (particularly with ointment)
* Eye irritation or redness



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Bone marrow suppression (primarily with systemic chloramphenicol)
* Aplastic anemia (primarily with systemic chloramphenicol)
* Gray baby syndrome (in neonates with systemic chloramphenicol exposure)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), angioedema


### **Long-Term Effects:**
* Potential for antibiotic resistance with prolonged use
* Secondary fungal infections



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Angioedema
* Blood dyscrasias


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to chloramphenicol, sulphonamides, or any component of the formulation
* History of blood dyscrasias, especially with chloramphenicol

## **Drug Interactions**

* Concurrent use with other topical ophthalmic medications should be approached cautiously. Allow sufficient time between applications if multiple ophthalmic medications are prescribed.
* Systemic antibiotics may interact with chloramphenicol if significant systemic absorption occurs.
* Potential interactions may occur with drugs metabolized by CYP450 enzymes.
*  Alcohol should be avoided due to potential interactions.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy:** Topical ophthalmic Chloramphenicol + Sulphacetamide is generally considered safe during pregnancy, although systemic absorption is minimal. However, systemic chloramphenicol should be avoided, particularly near term, due to the risk of gray baby syndrome.

**Breastfeeding:** Topical use is generally considered acceptable during breastfeeding, but caution is advisable if there is a family history of blood dyscrasias. Monitor the infant for gastrointestinal disturbances, adequate breastfeeding, and, if deemed necessary, complete blood count.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Chloramphenicol inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, while sulphacetamide interferes with bacterial folic acid synthesis.

* **Side Effects:**  Common: Transient burning, stinging, blurred vision, eye irritation.  Serious: Bone marrow suppression, aplastic anemia (systemic use), Gray baby syndrome (neonates with systemic use), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Toxic epidermal necrolysis.

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to components, history of blood dyscrasias.

* **Drug Interactions:** Other topical ophthalmic medications, systemic antibiotics.

* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Topical use generally considered safe; systemic chloramphenicol should be avoided.

* **Dosage:** Adults and children ≥2 months: 1-2 drops/ 1/2 inch ribbon of ointment every 2-3 hours initially, then every 3-4 hours.

* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for signs of infection resolution, ocular irritation, and any systemic side effects, especially in prolonged use.


## **Popular Combinations**

Chloramphenicol + Sulphacetamide is itself a combination product. It's not commonly combined with other medications in a single formulation.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Pre-screening for allergies and prior hypersensitivity reactions is necessary. Assess renal and hepatic function, particularly in patients with pre-existing conditions.

* **Specific Populations:** Exercise caution in pregnant and breastfeeding women. Use in neonates and infants requires careful consideration of potential systemic absorption and monitoring for adverse events. Geriatric patients may require dosage adjustments based on organ function.

* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Contact lenses should be avoided during treatment.
