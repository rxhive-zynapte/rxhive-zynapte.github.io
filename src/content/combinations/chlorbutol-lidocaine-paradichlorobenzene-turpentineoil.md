## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for impacted earwax (cerumen) removal and associated symptoms like ear pain and itching. It can also be used for external otitis (swimmer's ear) to soften and remove debris.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  This is a combination product with cerumenolytic, local anesthetic, antiseptic, analgesic, and soothing properties.

**Mechanism of Action:** The combined action of these ingredients softens and breaks down earwax, numbs the ear canal to reduce pain, and may offer mild anti-inflammatory and antiseptic effects.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is often found in ear drops under various brand names such as Waxactin, Waxolve, Edvaar W, and Dewax. It may also be referred to as Auralgan Otic Solution.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Paradichlorobenzene softens and dissolves earwax. Lidocaine provides local anesthesia, blocking nerve signals and reducing pain. Chlorbutol acts as a mild local anesthetic and antiseptic. Turpentine oil acts as a solvent for earwax and may have mild anti-inflammatory effects.
