## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the treatment of dry eyes and minor eye irritation. Dry eyes occur when the eyes do not produce enough tears or when the tears evaporate too quickly.
- **Pharmacological classification:** This combination includes a lubricant (polyvinyl alcohol), an antiseptic (povidone iodine), and a preservative (chlorbutol).  It can be categorized as an ophthalmic demulcent and antiseptic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Polyvinyl alcohol lubricates the eye surface, mimicking natural tears. Povidone iodine acts as a broad-spectrum antiseptic, eliminating bacteria and preventing infection. Chlorbutol preserves the solution and also acts as a mild local anesthetic.

## **Alternate Names**

- This specific combination does not have a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN). It's often referred to by the names of its components.
- **Brand names:**  Examples of brand names include Ocu Tear, Tears Plus, Irisol Plus, Tearflo, Stemoist, PVL Lubricating Eye Drops, Moss, Visio Tears. Brand names can vary regionally.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Polyvinyl alcohol increases tear film stability, reducing evaporation and providing relief from dryness and discomfort. Povidone iodine exerts its antiseptic effect by releasing free iodine, which disrupts microbial cell walls and inhibits protein synthesis. Chlorbutol provides a mild anesthetic effect, further alleviating discomfort.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Absorption is minimal with topical application. Metabolism and elimination pathways for this combination have not been extensively studied. Small amounts of iodine could be absorbed, and Chlorbutol is absorbed systemically when used as an ear drop.
- **Mode of action:** Polyvinyl alcohol acts through physical lubrication, while povidone iodine acts at the cellular level by directly affecting microbial integrity. Chlorbutol exerts its anesthetic effect likely through membrane stabilization.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Not applicable for this combination in its topical ophthalmic form. Chlorbutol, at high concentrations, may show GABAergic activity.
- **Elimination pathways:**  Minimally absorbed, so elimination is not a significant concern.  If absorbed, components are likely metabolized and excreted by the liver and kidneys.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 1-2 drops instilled into the affected eye(s) every 4 hours, or as needed, or as directed by the physician.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically required, but monitoring for any adverse effects is advised.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose modifications might be considered by the physician if systemic absorption is a concern.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Similar to renal impairment, dose modifications may be considered in case of potential systemic absorption.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Patients with thyroid disorders should use povidone iodine cautiously and under medical supervision.

### **Clinical Use Cases**
Dosage in specific medical settings is determined by physician based on patient specific factors.  There is no specific information available about this combination in different clinical use cases.
