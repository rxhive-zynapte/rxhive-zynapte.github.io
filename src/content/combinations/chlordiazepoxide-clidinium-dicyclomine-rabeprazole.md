## **Usage**

- This combination drug is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, and altered bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea). It is indicated when these symptoms are associated with anxiety or tension. It may also be used in conditions such as intestinal ulcers, gastric acidity, abdominal pain/cramps, diverticulitis and enterocolitis.
- **Pharmacological Classifications:** This is a combination product containing drugs with different classifications including:
    - Anxiolytic (Chlordiazepoxide)
    - Anticholinergic/Antispasmodic (Clidinium and Dicyclomine)
    - Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) (Rabeprazole)

- **Mechanism of Action:**
    - Chlordiazepoxide enhances the effect of GABA, a neurotransmitter that inhibits nerve activity in the brain, thereby reducing anxiety.
    - Clidinium and Dicyclomine relax the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract, reducing spasms and associated pain, bloating, and discomfort.
    - Rabeprazole suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the proton pump in the stomach lining, thus alleviating heartburn and indigestion.

## **Alternate Names**

- There is no officially recognized alternate name for this specific four-drug combination.  However, each component has its own generic names. The combination may be referred to by various informal descriptive names.
- **Brand Names:**  This combination is marketed under various brand names like Normaxin RT, Coliwin R, Rbsys-CCD, Clodex-R and others.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**
    - Chlordiazepoxide acts on GABA receptors in the central nervous system, increasing their inhibitory effects.
    - Clidinium and Dicyclomine act as anticholinergic agents, blocking the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors in the GI tract, thus reducing smooth muscle contractions.
    - Rabeprazole irreversibly binds to the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme (proton pump) in gastric parietal cells, inhibiting acid secretion.


- **Pharmacokinetics:**  The four components are absorbed, metabolized, and eliminated differently:
    - Chlordiazepoxide: Oral absorption is good. Metabolized by the liver (CYP3A4 and CYP2C19) and eliminated primarily via the kidneys. It has a long half-life, leading to potential accumulation.
    - Clidinium and Dicyclomine:  Well absorbed orally. Metabolized primarily by the liver and excreted in urine.
    - Rabeprazole: Absorbed from the intestines after oral administration. Metabolized by the liver (CYP2C19 and CYP3A4) and excreted via both renal and biliary routes.

- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** As outlined above, Chlordiazepoxide modulates GABA receptors.  Clidinium and Dicyclomine act on muscarinic receptors.  Rabeprazole inhibits H+/K+-ATPase.
- **Elimination pathways:**  Primarily renal and hepatic for all four components, with Rabeprazole also exhibiting biliary excretion.


## **Dosage**

The dosage should be individualized based on the patient's specific needs and response to treatment.  


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The typical starting dose is one capsule three to four times a day, usually 30-60 minutes before meals and at bedtime.
- Dosages can be adjusted based on individual response and tolerance.

#### **Children:**

- This combination is generally not recommended for children due to the lack of safety and efficacy data.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and titrate cautiously due to increased sensitivity to side effects, particularly drowsiness, confusion, and urinary retention.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary.  Monitor renal function closely.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Start with a lower dose and monitor liver function.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised in patients with glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, bladder neck obstruction, myasthenia gravis, ulcerative colitis, and cardiovascular disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  

- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations:**  This specific combination is generally not indicated for these clinical settings. Individual components may be used separately.

### **Dosage Adjustments**  

- Dose modifications are based on individual response, tolerability, and coexisting medical conditions, particularly renal and hepatic dysfunction.

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

- Dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, nausea, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, weakness, urinary hesitancy, flatulence, and coordination impairment.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Confusion, agitation, hallucinations, paradoxical excitement, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), severe dizziness, difficulty breathing, rapid or irregular heartbeat, urinary retention, and paralytic ileus.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Dependence on chlordiazepoxide can develop with prolonged use.  Cognitive impairment, especially in elderly patients, is a potential concern.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Any severe or persistent side effects, especially those affecting the central nervous system or cardiovascular system, require immediate attention.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any component of the drug.
- Glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, paralytic ileus, GI obstruction, severe ulcerative colitis, unstable cardiovascular status, acute hemorrhage, acute respiratory depression, prostate enlargement, bladder neck obstruction and urinary retention.
- Pregnancy, especially the third trimester (chlordiazepoxide is a Category D drug).
- Use with caution during breastfeeding.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Alcohol, other sedatives/hypnotics, antidepressants, antipsychotics, antihistamines, muscle relaxants, opioid analgesics, anticonvulsants, antihypertensives, antacids, ketoconazole, itraconazole, digoxin, cimetidine, disulfiram, and potassium supplements.
- CYP450 interactions are possible due to metabolism of chlordiazepoxide and rabeprazole by these enzymes.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Chlordiazepoxide is classified as Category D; not recommended during pregnancy, particularly the third trimester. Clidinium, dicyclomine, and rabeprazole also have limited safety data during pregnancy and are generally avoided.
- Fetal risks include teratogenicity (potential for birth defects) with Chlordiazepoxide. Other components may also pose risks.
- This combination is excreted in breast milk and can potentially cause drowsiness and other adverse effects in infants.  Alternative feeding methods are recommended.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
