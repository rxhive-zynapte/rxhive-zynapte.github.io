## **Usage**

Chlordiazepoxide + Clidinium is prescribed as adjunctive therapy for the symptomatic relief of gastrointestinal disorders such as peptic ulcer, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and enterocolitis when these conditions are complicated by anxiety and tension.  It combines an anxiolytic (chlordiazepoxide) and an anticholinergic (clidinium).

## **Alternate Names**

This combination drug is often referred to as Librax.  Other regional or international brand names may exist.

## **How It Works**

**Chlordiazepoxide** is a benzodiazepine that enhances the effect of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the central nervous system. This leads to sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant effects.  It is metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4, and its metabolites are excreted renally.

**Clidinium bromide** is an anticholinergic/antimuscarinic agent. It competitively inhibits the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. This results in decreased gastrointestinal motility and secretions. It is excreted primarily unchanged in the urine.

The combination of these two agents helps manage gastrointestinal symptoms exacerbated by anxiety and stress.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The initial adult dose is generally 1 or 2 capsules, three or four times a day, administered before meals and at bedtime.  The dose can be gradually adjusted as needed and tolerated.

#### **Children:**

The use and dosage in children must be determined by a doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** The initial dose should not exceed 2 capsules per day. It can be increased gradually as tolerated, keeping in mind the increased risk of ataxia, oversedation, and confusion in this population.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary due to impaired metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or other relevant comorbid conditions.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

The specific dosage for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations should be determined on a case-by-case basis by the attending physician and may deviate from the standard dosages.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications should be considered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms that may affect drug metabolism.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and urinary retention.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Paradoxical reactions (e.g., increased anxiety, agitation, aggression), blood dyscrasias (e.g., agranulocytosis, leukopenia), hepatic dysfunction, jaundice.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, angioedema, anaphylaxis.


## **Contraindications**

Glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, obstructive gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., paralytic ileus, ulcerative colitis), benign prostatic hyperplasia, urinary retention.

## **Drug Interactions**

Alcohol, other CNS depressants (e.g., opioids, antihistamines), anticholinergic medications, antacids, ketoconazole, and other CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

This drug should be used with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  It is important to weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks to the fetus or infant.  Consult with a specialist.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Benzodiazepine enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission and anticholinergic blocking acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors.
- **Side Effects:** Drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention.
- **Contraindications:** Glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, obstructive GI disease, BPH.
- **Drug Interactions:**  Alcohol, CNS depressants, anticholinergics.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution. Consult specialist.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 1-2 capsules 3-4 times/day. Elderly: Initiate with lower doses.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests, complete blood count.

## **Popular Combinations**

This drug is not typically combined with other medications for synergistic effects, as it already contains two active ingredients.  Concomitant use of other medications requires careful consideration of potential drug interactions.

## **Precautions**

- Assess for pre-existing medical conditions, allergies, and concomitant medications.
- Monitor for adverse effects, especially in elderly patients.
- Avoid abrupt discontinuation.
