## **Usage**

Chlordiazepoxide + Mebeverine is prescribed for the relief of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms, including abdominal cramps, pain, bloating, and flatulence.  It is also used to manage the anxiety and tension often associated with IBS.

It combines a benzodiazepine (chlordiazepoxide) and an antispasmodic (mebeverine). Chlordiazepoxide belongs to the anxiolytic and sedative classes, while mebeverine is classified as an antispasmodic and musculotropic agent.

Chlordiazepoxide enhances the effect of GABA, a neurotransmitter that reduces brain activity, leading to a calming effect. Mebeverine directly relaxes the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract, relieving spasms and pain.

## **Alternate Names**

While no specific alternate generic names exist, numerous brand names market this combination, including  "Matiz Plus,"  "Emoxide-M," and "Coloverin A."

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Mebeverine acts directly on the smooth muscle of the gut, reducing spasms without affecting normal intestinal motility.  Chlordiazepoxide enhances the effect of GABA, leading to a calming effect on the central nervous system. This dual action addresses both the physical and psychological symptoms of IBS.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Mebeverine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Its metabolism is primarily through ester hydrolysis, and the metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine. Chlordiazepoxide is also well-absorbed orally and undergoes extensive liver metabolism, with its metabolites excreted in the urine.  Both drugs can potentially interact with other medications metabolized by the same hepatic enzymes (e.g., CYP450 enzymes).

**Mode of Action:**  Mebeverine's exact mechanism is unclear but involves inhibiting calcium influx into smooth muscle cells, thus reducing contractility.  Chlordiazepoxide binds to benzodiazepine receptors in the central nervous system, potentiating GABA's inhibitory effects. No specific receptor binding or enzyme inhibition has been identified for mebeverine beyond its calcium channel effects.

**Elimination Pathways:** Both drugs are primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

A typical dosage is one tablet or capsule containing 135mg of mebeverine and 5mg or 10mg of chlordiazepoxide, taken three times a day, approximately 20 minutes before meals. Some formulations with sustained-release mebeverine may be taken twice daily. The dosage may be adjusted according to the patient's response and tolerance.

#### **Children:**

This combination is generally *not recommended* for children under 18 years of age due to limited safety and efficacy data.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose (e.g., one tablet twice a day) and increase cautiously as needed.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary; consult specialist guidance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use cautiously and with dosage adjustments as the liver metabolizes both drugs.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider potential drug interactions and adjust accordingly.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is specifically indicated for IBS and is not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.  Benzodiazepines like chlordiazepoxide might be used independently in some of these contexts, but not in this fixed combination.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be needed for elderly patients, individuals with renal or hepatic impairment, and those with certain comorbid conditions. Close monitoring and individualization of therapy are crucial.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, constipation, blurred vision, difficulty concentrating, and confusion.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), paradoxical reactions (increased anxiety, agitation), jaundice, difficulty breathing, and dependency with prolonged use.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Potential for dependence and withdrawal symptoms with long-term chlordiazepoxide use.  Tolerance may also develop, requiring higher doses for the same effect.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, paradoxical reactions (increased anxiety, agitation), dependence and withdrawal symptoms.


## **Contraindications**

Glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, paralytic ileus, myasthenia gravis, porphyria, hypersensitivity to either drug, and severe liver or kidney disease.  Use with extreme caution in pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Not recommended for children under 18.

## **Drug Interactions**

Alcohol, other CNS depressants (e.g., opioids, barbiturates, antihistamines), some antidepressants (e.g., MAOIs, SSRIs), muscle relaxants, certain antifungal and HIV medications.  Discuss all medications and supplements with a doctor.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

This combination is generally *not recommended* during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, due to the risk of congenital disabilities.  It is also *not recommended* while breastfeeding as chlordiazepoxide is excreted in breast milk.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Mebeverine: Direct smooth muscle relaxation in the gut; Chlordiazepoxide: Enhances GABA activity, leading to CNS depression.
- **Side Effects:** Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, constipation, blurred vision, dependence.
- **Contraindications:** Glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, paralytic ileus, myasthenia gravis, porphyria, hypersensitivity, severe liver/kidney disease, pregnancy, breastfeeding, children <18 years.
- **Drug Interactions:** Alcohol, CNS depressants, some antidepressants, muscle relaxants, antifungal & HIV medications.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Not recommended.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 1 tablet (135mg mebeverine/5-10mg chlordiazepoxide) TID before meals. Adjustments necessary for elderly and those with hepatic/renal impairment.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Liver function tests, renal function tests, monitor for signs of dependence.


## **Popular Combinations**

This combination is itself a common pairing. No other fixed combinations involving both these agents are widely used.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess for allergies, liver/kidney function, and other medical conditions.
- **Specific Populations:**  See "Special Cases" under "Dosage."
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid alcohol; caution with driving or operating machinery.
