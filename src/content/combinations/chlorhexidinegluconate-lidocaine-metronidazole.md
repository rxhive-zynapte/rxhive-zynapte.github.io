## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the treatment of various oral infections and conditions, including:

-   **Gingivitis:** Inflammation of the gums.
-   **Periodontitis:** Infection of the gums and supporting structures of the teeth.
-   **Mouth ulcers:** Painful sores in the mouth.
-   **Other oral lesions:** Including those associated with dental procedures like dry socket.  It can also be used as an adjunct to scaling and root planing.
- **Vaginal infections**:  Such as bacterial vaginosis (source [2]).

**Pharmacological Classifications:**

-   Antiseptic (Chlorhexidine Gluconate)
-   Local anesthetic (Lidocaine Hydrochloride)
-   Antibiotic (Metronidazole)

**Mechanism of Action:**

-   **Chlorhexidine Gluconate:** Disrupts bacterial cell membranes and inhibits bacterial growth.  It also helps to prevent plaque build-up.
-   **Lidocaine Hydrochloride:** Blocks nerve signals, providing local pain relief by forming a protective layer over the affected area.
-   **Metronidazole:** Inhibits bacterial DNA synthesis, ultimately causing bacterial death; effective against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.

## **Alternate Names**

- Chlorhexidine Gluconate + Lidocaine Hydrochloride + Metronidazole
- Chlorhexidine Gluconate + Lignocaine + Metronidazole

**Brand Names:**

- Rexidin-M Forte
- Quadrajel
- Meetgyl-DG
- Metrogyl DG LA Gel
- Metrohex Plus + Gel
- MXL Oral Gel


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

The three components work synergistically: chlorhexidine gluconate as an antiseptic, lidocaine hydrochloride as a local anesthetic, and metronidazole as an antibiotic. This combined action combats infection, reduces pain and inflammation, and promotes healing within the oral cavity. For vaginal application, the combination treats infections, reduces pain, and promotes healing. (source [2])

**Pharmacokinetics:**

- **Absorption:** Chlorhexidine gluconate has negligible systemic absorption when used topically in the mouth. Lidocaine is absorbed following topical application to mucous membranes, with onset of action within minutes and lasting for 1-2 hours.  Metronidazole, when applied topically in the oral cavity, is minimally absorbed.
- **Metabolism:** Lidocaine is primarily metabolized in the liver.  Metronidazole is also metabolized in the liver. Chlorhexidine gluconate is not significantly metabolized.
- **Elimination:** Chlorhexidine gluconate is primarily eliminated in feces. Lidocaine and metronidazole are primarily excreted in urine, with some fecal excretion for metronidazole.

**Mode of Action:**

- Chlorhexidine:  Damages bacterial cell walls and DNA.
- Lidocaine:  Blocks sodium channels in nerve fibers, inhibiting pain signal transmission.
- Metronidazole:  Disrupts DNA synthesis and damages bacterial DNA.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

A thin layer of gel applied to the affected area 2-3 times daily, or as directed by the physician. For mouth application, avoid eating or drinking for at least 30 minutes after application.  For vaginal application, follow the doctor's instructions (source [2]).

#### **Children:**

Use in children should be under the guidance of a dentist or physician. Pediatric dosage will be adjusted based on the child's age and weight. Safety and efficacy in children have not been fully established for all indications.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required, but monitoring for adverse effects is advised.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advised in patients with liver disease, and dosage adjustment may be required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with certain blood disorders (e.g., porphyria) or those with a history of disulfiram use.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources primarily focus on the use of this drug combination for oral and vaginal conditions. Therefore, detailed dosage guidelines specific to other clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or emergency situations are not available.  However, the general guideline is topical application as needed to control infection and alleviate pain.  Consult specialized resources and guidelines for specific clinical use cases outside of oral and vaginal conditions.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on patient-specific factors, such as the severity of the condition, renal/hepatic function, and any concurrent medications.  Always follow the prescribing physician's instructions for dosage adjustments.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Metallic taste
- Bitter taste
- Burning sensation at the application site
- Transient redness
- Irritation
- Dryness
- Staining of teeth (temporary)
- Nausea
- Change in taste sensation
- Vaginal burning or pain (for vaginal application)
- Headache (for vaginal application)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Severe allergic reactions (e.g., rash, itching, swelling)
- Numbness of mouth or tongue
- Neurological symptoms (e.g., dizziness, confusion)


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Prolonged use, particularly of chlorhexidine, can lead to more pronounced staining of the teeth.  Monitor patients for any signs of superinfection (e.g., oral thrush).


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any severe or persistent side effects, including signs of allergic reaction or neurological symptoms, require immediate medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication.
- Severe liver disease.
- Blood disorders like porphyria.
- History of disulfiram use (within the past 14 days).
- Deep oral ulcers or throat infections.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Other antiseptics (e.g., iodine solutions)
- Other local anesthetics (e.g., bupivacaine)
- Other antibiotics (e.g., clindamycin)
- Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin): Metronidazole may enhance anticoagulant effects.
- Disulfiram: May cause confusion and other adverse reactions.
- Alcohol: May interact with metronidazole, causing disulfiram-like reactions (nausea, vomiting, flushing, headache, etc.).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established. Use only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the fetus or infant.  Consult with a physician.
