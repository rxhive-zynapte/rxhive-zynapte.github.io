## **Usage**

Chlorhexidine Gluconate + Metronidazole is prescribed for the treatment of gingivitis (gum inflammation) and other oral infections like periodontitis, mouth ulcers, and oral thrush. It can also be used as an adjunct to dental procedures such as scaling and root planing.  Pharmacologically, this combination acts as an antiseptic and antibiotic. The Chlorhexidine Gluconate component acts as an antiseptic, disrupting bacterial cell membranes and inhibiting plaque formation.  Metronidazole, an antibiotic, disrupts bacterial DNA synthesis, targeting anaerobic bacteria prevalent in oral infections.

## **Alternate Names**

This drug combination may be referred to simply as Chlorhexidine + Metronidazole.  Brand names can vary regionally; some examples include Heximetro and Metronidazole Denta.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Chlorhexidine gluconate primarily acts by disrupting the cell walls of bacteria and some fungi and viruses. Metronidazole enters bacterial cells and forms toxic metabolites that damage bacterial DNA, inhibiting their growth and multiplication.  The combination exhibits a synergistic effect, enhancing efficacy against oral pathogens.

**Pharmacokinetics:** After topical oral application, Chlorhexidine Gluconate exhibits minimal systemic absorption due to its cationic nature, adhering to oral tissues. Metronidazole is absorbed minimally through topical application as well.  This results in localized drug action within the oral cavity. Elimination pathways for the small amount of metronidazole absorbed are primarily hepatic.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

A thin film of gel or a prescribed amount of mouthwash is applied to the affected area two to four times daily. Patients should avoid rinsing, eating, or drinking for at least 30 minutes after application.

#### **Children:**

Use in children under 6 is contraindicated. For children aged 6-12 years, the medication should be used only under the guidance of a healthcare professional. The dosage may be adjusted based on the child's age and weight.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** The standard adult dosage is generally applicable, but caution should be exercised, particularly at high doses or with prolonged use.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be necessary, but specific guidelines are limited. Monitoring kidney function is advisable.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution should be exercised, particularly with long-term use. Liver function tests may be recommended.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Specific dosage modifications may be necessary based on individual patient conditions and concomitant medications.  Consult with a specialist for specific recommendations.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use/Emergency Situations:**  The use of this combination is not typically indicated in these settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosages must be adjusted for patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction.  The exact adjustments will depend on the severity of the impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Metallic or bitter taste, burning sensation, irritation, dryness of the mouth, transient redness, staining of teeth, nausea, headache.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions, skin redness or irritation, agitation, blurred vision, fever, constipation, loss of appetite, convulsions, peripheral neuropathy (numbness/tingling), edema, erythema, contact dermatitis, vaginal irritation.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Prolonged use can lead to more pronounced tooth staining and potentially increase the risk of oral candidiasis (thrush).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, severe skin reactions.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to Metronidazole or Chlorhexidine, patients with severe liver or blood disorders like porphyria, children under 6 years old, concurrent or recent Disulfiram use, pregnancy, breastfeeding (for long term use).

## **Drug Interactions**

Interactions may occur with anticoagulants (Warfarin, Coumarins), medications for HIV (Amprenavir), Disulfiram, alcohol, and anionic agents (commonly found in toothpaste).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

This combination is contraindicated during pregnancy and long term breastfeeding. Short courses are acceptable with infant monitoring for potential adverse effects such as thrush and diarrhea.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Chlorhexidine: disrupts bacterial cell walls. Metronidazole: inhibits bacterial DNA synthesis.
