## **Usage**

Chlorhexidine gluconate + neomycin is prescribed for the topical treatment of bacterial skin infections. It is a combination product with antiseptic and antibiotic properties. Neomycin is classified as an aminoglycoside antibiotic, and chlorhexidine gluconate is a broad-spectrum antiseptic.  The combination is effective against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria commonly involved in skin infections.


## **Alternate Names**

No internationally recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination.  Brand names vary by region and manufacturer; Naseptin is one example.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Chlorhexidine gluconate disrupts the bacterial cell membrane, leading to leakage of intracellular contents and cell death. Neomycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, thus preventing bacterial growth and replication.

**Pharmacokinetics:** When applied topically, the absorption of both chlorhexidine and neomycin is minimal.  A small amount of neomycin may be absorbed through broken skin or open wounds, particularly with prolonged use or application to large surface areas.  Neomycin that is absorbed is primarily excreted renally, while chlorhexidine is poorly absorbed and excreted mainly in feces.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  A small amount of cream or ointment should be applied to the affected area two to four times daily, or as directed by a physician.

#### **Children:** Use in children should be under the guidance of a physician.  The dosage and frequency will be determined based on the child's age, weight, and the severity of the infection.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution. Monitor for signs of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, especially with prolonged use.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustments may be necessary. Monitor renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments are typically needed for topical application.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific guidance.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage guidelines for specialized clinical situations are not established for this specific drug combination.  Consult specialized literature or expert opinion.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on individual patient factors like renal function and age.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
- Local skin irritation (redness, itching, burning)
- Allergic contact dermatitis

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Ototoxicity (hearing loss) with systemic absorption of neomycin
- Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage) with systemic absorption of neomycin

### **Long-Term Effects**

With prolonged use, skin sensitization to neomycin may develop.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions are rare but possible.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to chlorhexidine or neomycin
- Use near the eyes or ears (for some formulations)

## **Drug Interactions**

Limited information exists regarding specific drug interactions with topical chlorhexidine + neomycin. No significant interactions are generally expected with topical application due to minimal systemic absorption.  However, concomitant use of other topical medications on the same area may increase the risk of irritation or allergic reactions.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

While topical chlorhexidine + neomycin is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, caution should be exercised.  Consult a physician before use. Wash any cream or ointment off the breasts before breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Chlorhexidine: antiseptic disrupting bacterial cell wall; Neomycin: aminoglycoside antibiotic inhibiting protein synthesis
- **Side Effects:** Local irritation, allergic contact dermatitis, rarely ototoxicity/nephrotoxicity (with systemic absorption).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:**  Limited information available, no significant interactions expected with topical use.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Generally safe, use with caution.
- **Dosage:** Apply topically 2-4 times daily. Adjust based on age and renal function.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function (if significant systemic absorption is anticipated).

## **Popular Combinations**

Chlorhexidine and neomycin are typically not combined with other drugs in topical formulations.


## **Precautions**

- Avoid contact with eyes and ears.
- Do not use on large areas of broken skin or open wounds without medical supervision due to the risk of systemic absorption of neomycin.
- Discontinue if skin irritation or sensitization occurs.
