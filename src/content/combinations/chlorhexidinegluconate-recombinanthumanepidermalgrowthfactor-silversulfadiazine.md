## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily used to treat first and second-degree burns. It is also indicated for skin ulcers (incisions, abrasions, minor cuts, wounds), and diabetic foot ulcers.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Topical antibacterial, antiseptic, and growth factor.

**Mechanism of Action:** This medication combines three active ingredients that work synergistically:  rhEGF stimulates cell growth and regeneration, chlorhexidine gluconate acts as an antiseptic and antibacterial agent, and silver sulfadiazine provides broad-spectrum antimicrobial action.


## **Alternate Names**

* SLVRGEN
* SLVRGEN®


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** rhEGF binds to EGF receptors, stimulating cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, leading to accelerated tissue regeneration. Chlorhexidine disrupts bacterial cell walls. Silver sulfadiazine hinders bacterial folic acid synthesis, and silver ions bind to bacterial DNA and membranes.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily topical action. Minimal systemic absorption with intact skin, but absorption increases with large burns or open wounds. Silver sulfadiazine metabolizes to sulfadiazine, which is excreted renally. Chlorhexidine has poor absorption through intact skin, but systemic absorption may occur from broken skin.

**Mode of Action:**  rhEGF activates the MAP kinase pathway, leading to the phosphorylation of transcription factors that promote cell proliferation. Chlorhexidine causes leakage of intracellular components, leading to bacterial death. Silver sulfadiazine competes with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) to inhibit bacterial dihydrofolic acid synthesis. Silver ions also damage bacterial DNA.

**Elimination Pathways:** Silver sulfadiazine is metabolized to sulfadiazine and excreted renally.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a thin layer (approximately 1/16 inch or 1.5 mm) to the cleansed and debrided area 1-2 times daily, or as directed by the physician. Reapply at least every 24 hours, and to any area where the cream has been removed.

#### **Children:**

Use and dose must be determined by a doctor for children older than 2 months. Not recommended for premature infants and infants 2 months and younger.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution and monitor for adverse reactions.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; drug accumulation possible.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution; drug accumulation possible.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with G6PD deficiency as hemolysis may occur. Caution in patients with porphyria.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in these situations should be determined by the treating physician based on individual patient needs. For hand burns, apply the cream and enclose the hand in a plastic bag or glove, changing the dressing every three days or as needed.

* **Intubation:** N/A
* **Surgical Procedures:**  May be used on surgical incisions.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** N/A
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Dosage as per physician's recommendation.
* **Emergency Situations:** N/A


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be needed based on patient response, wound/burn characteristics, and complicating factors. Close monitoring is essential, especially with renal or hepatic impairment, G6PD deficiency, and porphyria.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Itching
* Pain, burning, or stinging at the application site
* Rash
* Skin irritation, redness
* Dryness


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Allergic reactions (rash, swelling, difficulty breathing, dizziness, nausea)
* Leukopenia
* Argyria (bluish-gray skin discoloration)
* Hemolysis (particularly in patients with G6PD deficiency)



### **Long-Term Effects**

With prolonged use, monitor for silver toxicity (argyria) and blood cell count changes.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions require immediate medical attention. Monitor for wound site infections.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any component
* Pregnant women at term, premature infants, neonates in the first month of life
* G6PD deficiency
* Severe hepatic or renal impairment


## **Drug Interactions**

* Cimetidine: May increase leukopenia risk in large burns.
* Sodium nitrite: May increase methemoglobinemia risk.
* Proteolytic enzymes (collagenase, papain, sutilains): May be inactivated by silver.
* Topical antiseptics (e.g., hydrogen peroxide): May interact and cause irritation.
* Corticosteroids (e.g., hydrocortisone): May increase skin irritation.
* Oral hypoglycemic agents and phenytoin: Their action may be potentiated.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category: C, X (near term).  Unsafe during pregnancy.  Avoid use in pregnant females at term, premature infants, or in newborn infants in the first month of life (due to the risk of kernicterus).

Not known if distributed in breast milk. Use with caution.
