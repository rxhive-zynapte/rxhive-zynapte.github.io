## **Usage**

This combination is primarily prescribed for the treatment and prevention of oral infections like gingivitis (gum inflammation), oral mucositis (inflammation of the mucous lining of the mouth), and to control mouth odor. It's classified as an **antiseptic mouthwash**.

The mechanism of action involves the synergistic effects of the three components: Chlorhexidine Gluconate disrupts bacterial cell walls and inhibits bacterial growth, Sodium Fluoride strengthens tooth enamel and prevents cavities, and Zinc Chloride acts as an astringent and antiseptic, further reducing bacterial growth and neutralizing volatile sulfur compounds that cause bad breath.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for this specific combination, although regional or international variations may exist. Brand names under which it's marketed include "Thermokind Cool Mint Flavour Mouthwash," "Intafresh Mouthwash," "Hexicol," "Adefress Mouthwash," "Orahex DG," "Flicker Plus M/W," "Oxyfresh Mouthwash," and "Aqua Joy Mouth Wash."


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Chlorhexidine Gluconate exerts its antiseptic effect by binding to bacterial cell walls, causing disruption and leakage of intracellular components, leading to bacterial death. Sodium Fluoride incorporates into tooth enamel, making it more resistant to acid attacks from bacteria and promoting remineralization. Zinc Chloride acts as an astringent, causing a tightening effect on tissues, and also possesses antiseptic properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The combination is intended for topical oral use as a mouthwash.  Absorption is minimal when used as directed.  The ingredients are not meant to be swallowed. If swallowed accidentally, negligible systemic absorption is anticipated. Elimination pathways for any absorbed amounts are primarily renal.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults and Children over 12 years:**  Typically, 10-15 ml of the mouthwash is rinsed around the mouth for 30 seconds twice daily, after brushing and before bedtime. The solution should be expectorated, not swallowed. 

#### **Children under 12 years:** Usage in children under 12 years should be determined and supervised by a dentist or doctor.  Some sources advise against use in children under 6.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosages for clinical use cases such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not specifically defined for this combination. Its primary use is for routine oral hygiene and management of gingivitis and oral mucositis.
