## **Usage**

This combination is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of gingivitis (gum inflammation), oral thrush (a fungal infection), mouth ulcers, and to maintain oral hygiene. It is also used as an adjunct to professional dental cleaning.  Its pharmacological classifications include antiseptic, antifungal, and anticariogenic.

The mechanism of action involves the synergistic effect of its components: Chlorhexidine Gluconate disrupts bacterial cell membranes, Triclosan inhibits bacterial fatty acid synthesis, and Sodium Monofluorophosphate strengthens tooth enamel and inhibits bacterial metabolism, preventing cavities.

## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination, though the individual components have various names (e.g., Chlorhexidine digluconate for Chlorhexidine Gluconate).  A popular brand name for this combination is Rexidin Plus.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Chlorhexidine Gluconate and Triclosan exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, and yeasts. Sodium Monofluorophosphate promotes remineralization of tooth enamel.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily topical action within the oral cavity.  Minimal systemic absorption occurs with oral rinsing. Excretion of absorbed components is likely renal, though information specific to this combination is limited.

**Mode of Action:** Chlorhexidine Gluconate disrupts the bacterial cell wall and precipitates cytoplasmic contents.  Triclosan inhibits an enzyme essential for bacterial fatty acid synthesis. Sodium Monofluorophosphate is hydrolyzed in saliva to release fluoride ions, which integrate into tooth enamel, making it more resistant to acid demineralization. It also inhibits bacterial enolase, an enzyme involved in carbohydrate metabolism.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 15 ml of the undiluted solution, rinsed for 30-60 seconds twice daily (morning and evening after brushing). Do not swallow.  Avoid rinsing with water, eating, or drinking for 30 minutes after use.
