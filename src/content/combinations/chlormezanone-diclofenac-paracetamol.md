## **Usage**

- This combination medication is prescribed for the relief of pain, inflammation, and muscle spasms associated with musculoskeletal conditions such as low back pain, sprains, strains, myalgia (muscle pain), osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, post-operative pain, traumatic muscle injuries, and cervical root and disc syndrome.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**
    - Diclofenac: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
    - Paracetamol: Analgesic and antipyretic
    - Chlormezanone: Centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination targets different pain pathways for enhanced relief. Diclofenac reduces inflammation by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. Paracetamol provides central pain and fever relief. Chlormezanone acts on the central nervous system to reduce muscle spasms.

## **Alternate Names**

- Diclofenac + Paracetamol + Chlorzoxazone
- Diclopar
- Diclomec Plus
- Other regional brand names may exist.  Some brand names may include vitamins in addition to the three base ingredients, such as Dolo-Neurobion Forte (B Vitamins).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Diclofenac inhibits COX enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis. Paracetamol acts centrally on pain and temperature regulation. Chlormezanone suppresses polysynaptic reflexes, causing muscle relaxation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Absorption: All three drugs are well-absorbed orally.
    - Metabolism: Diclofenac is highly protein-bound and undergoes hepatic metabolism primarily through CYP2C9. Paracetamol is mostly conjugated in the liver via glucuronidation and sulfation pathways with a minor fraction metabolized by CYP enzymes (CYP2E1, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4) to a reactive metabolite that is normally detoxified by glutathione. Chlorzoxazone undergoes hepatic metabolism through hydroxylation and oxidation primarily by CYP2E1 and to a lesser extent CYP1A2.
    - Elimination: Diclofenac metabolites are excreted in urine and bile. Paracetamol metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Chlorzoxazone is predominantly excreted in urine, both as unchanged drug and as its metabolites.
- **Mode of Action:**  Diclofenac: COX inhibition reduces prostaglandin production. Paracetamol: acts centrally on pain and temperature regulation. Chlorzoxazone: Suppresses polysynaptic reflexes in the spinal cord and subcortical areas of the brain.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** One tablet (Diclofenac 50 mg, Paracetamol 325 mg, Chlorzoxazone 250/500 mg) two to three times daily.  Maximum daily doses are Diclofenac 150mg, Paracetamol 4000mg, and Chlorzoxazone 3000mg.


#### **Children:** This combination is generally not recommended for children due to lack of safety and efficacy data.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate therapy at the lowest effective dose and monitor closely for adverse effects. Dose reduction may be necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Exercise caution and consider dose reduction.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Adjust dosage based on the severity of impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful evaluation is needed; dose adjustments may be necessary.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  Dosage guidelines for specific medical settings are generally the same as standard dosage guidelines. If more frequent dosing is needed, increase the dosing frequency to every 6 hours but make sure not to exceed the daily maximum dose for any of the three drugs.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on patient-specific factors such as renal/hepatic dysfunction, other medical conditions, and potential drug interactions.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, constipation, diarrhea, skin rash, weakness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions, liver injury, gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiovascular events, renal impairment, blood dyscrasias, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Prolonged use can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, and kidney problems.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe allergic reactions, severe liver injury, severe gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiovascular events.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any component; active peptic ulcer disease; severe hepatic or renal impairment; history of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation associated with NSAID use; aspirin triad; last trimester of pregnancy; porphyria.

## **Drug Interactions**

- NSAIDs, anticoagulants, antihypertensives, diuretics, methotrexate, lithium, alcohol, other medications containing paracetamol, CYP450 enzyme inducers/inhibitors.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Avoid during the third trimester. Use with caution during the first and second trimesters. Consult a physician before use.
