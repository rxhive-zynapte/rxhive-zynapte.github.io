## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as a topical antiseptic and analgesic for gum inflammation (gingivitis) and minor oral infections.  It is not typically used systemically.

- **Chloroform:** Provides mild local anesthetic and counterirritant effects.
- **Iodine & Potassium Iodide:** Broad-spectrum antiseptics against bacteria, fungi, and some viruses. Potassium iodide increases iodine's solubility.
- **Sodium Chloride:** Mild antiseptic, maintains isotonicity.
- **Thymol:**  Antiseptic and antifungal properties.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Topical antiseptic, analgesic, counterirritant.

**Mechanism of Action:** The combined ingredients provide antiseptic and analgesic activity. Iodine disrupts microbial protein synthesis and membrane integrity. Thymol disrupts microbial cell membranes and inhibits bacterial enzymes. Chloroform contributes a mild anesthetic effect.


## **Alternate Names**

No official alternate names exist. This combination is generally referred to by its component names.  A brand name containing this combination is Pyonil Gum Paint.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The combination exerts its effects through the combined action of the individual components. Iodine acts as a broad-spectrum antiseptic, thymol provides additional antiseptic and antifungal activity, and chloroform offers mild local anesthetic effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily intended for topical use, minimal systemic absorption is expected.

**Mode of Action:**
- **Iodine:** Disrupts microbial protein synthesis and membrane integrity.
- **Thymol:** Disrupts microbial cell membranes and inhibits bacterial enzyme activity.
- **Chloroform:** Contributes a mild anesthetic effect.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  The primary mechanism of action is not related to receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation. It works through direct antiseptic and local anesthetic effects.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily topical; minimal systemic absorption means limited systemic elimination.


## **Dosage**
