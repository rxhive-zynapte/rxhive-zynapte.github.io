      side effects and the need to report any signs of hemolysis (e.g., dark
      urine, fatigue, pallor). Reinforce the need for G6PD screening before
      primaquine is used.  Advise pregnant women to avoid primaquine. Discuss
      the use of reliable contraception to prevent pregnancy during and after
      treatment.

      **A:** Generally, yes.  Primaquine levels in breast milk are low and
      usually safe for infants over 28 days old with normal G6PD levels.
      However, infants should receive their own age-appropriate doses if
      prophylaxis or treatment is needed.  Testing the infant for G6PD
      deficiency is important prior to administration of primaquine to the
      mother.

## **Usage**

Chloroquine + Primaquine is prescribed for the *prevention and treatment of malaria*, specifically *Plasmodium vivax* and *Plasmodium ovale* malaria.  It is crucial for preventing relapse by eliminating latent liver stages (hypnozoites) of these parasites, which chloroquine alone cannot eradicate.  This drug combination falls under the **pharmacological classification** of **antimalarials**.

The mechanism of action involves multiple pathways. Chloroquine inhibits heme polymerase, preventing the detoxification of heme, a byproduct of hemoglobin digestion toxic to the parasite.  Primaquine disrupts the parasite's mitochondrial function, which is vital for its survival, particularly in the liver stages (hypnozoites).

## **Alternate Names**

While "Chloroquine + Primaquine" accurately represents this combination therapy, there's no widely recognized single alternate name.  Regionally, the drug combination may be referred to simply as chloroquine and primaquine. A commercially available combination of chloroquine and primaquine marketed for malaria prophylaxis was previously sold under the brand name **Aralen with Primaquine**, but it is no longer available on the market.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Chloroquine concentrates in the parasite's food vacuole, inhibiting heme polymerase.  This leads to a buildup of toxic heme, ultimately destroying the parasite. Primaquine's exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it is thought to disrupt the electron transport chain within the parasite's mitochondria, particularly affecting the hypnozoites in the liver.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Chloroquine:**  Well-absorbed orally, extensively distributed in tissues, metabolized by the liver (CYP2C8, CYP3A4), and has a long half-life (weeks to months). Eliminated renally and in bile.
* **Primaquine:**  Well-absorbed orally, metabolized by the liver (CYP2D6), and has a shorter half-life (3-8 hours). Primarily eliminated in the urine as metabolites.

**Mode of Action:**  See pharmacodynamics. Chloroquine targets heme polymerase, while primaquine disrupts mitochondrial function. The two drugs have synergistic effects, increasing efficacy, particularly against *P. vivax* relapse.

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, neurotransmitter modulation:** Chloroquine inhibits heme polymerase. Primaquine is not known to specifically bind receptors or modulate neurotransmitters.

**Elimination Pathways:** Chloroquine: renal and biliary excretion, hepatic metabolism. Primaquine: Primarily renal excretion of metabolites.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Chloroquine:** 25 mg/kg (base) divided over 3 days.
* **Primaquine:** 0.25mg/kg (base)/day (approximately 15 mg base/day for an average adult) for 14 days. 

#### **Children:**

* **Chloroquine:**  Similar to adult dosing based on weight.
* **Primaquine:** 0.25mg/kg/day for 14 days. Pediatric dosing must be carefully calculated based on weight.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Consider potential age-related decline in renal and hepatic function and adjust dose accordingly.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Chloroquine dose reduction might be necessary depending on the severity of impairment. Primaquine dosage adjustments should be considered. 
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Careful monitoring is advised, and dose adjustment may be necessary for both drugs.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** For patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, primaquine is contraindicated due to the risk of hemolytic anemia.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Chloroquine + Primaquine is not typically used in situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency scenarios. Its usage is primarily focused on malaria prevention and treatment.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on patient-specific factors like renal and hepatic function, G6PD deficiency, and potential drug interactions. Consult specialized resources and guidelines for specific scenarios.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea
* Headache, dizziness, itching (particularly with chloroquine)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Hemolytic anemia (especially with primaquine in G6PD deficient individuals)
* Methemoglobinemia
* Seizures

### **Long-Term Effects**

* Retinopathy (with long-term, high-dose chloroquine)

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Primaquine is contraindicated during pregnancy. Chloroquine can be used during pregnancy, but benefits and risks should be carefully evaluated.
* **Breastfeeding:** Primaquine levels in breast milk are low, and generally considered safe for infants over 28 days of age with normal G6PD levels.  Breastfed infants should not receive antimalarial protection or treatment through breast milk, and require appropriate dosages according to infant guidelines.
