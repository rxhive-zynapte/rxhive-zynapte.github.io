This combination medication, now **banned in India** due to safety and efficacy concerns, was previously used to treat cough and symptoms associated with upper respiratory allergies or the common cold.  It is crucial for medical professionals to be aware of this ban and consult updated regulatory guidelines and resources for current treatment recommendations.

## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:**  Previously indicated for the relief of cough and symptoms associated with upper respiratory allergies and the common cold, such as runny nose, sneezing, watery eyes, and throat irritation. Note: This combination is **no longer recommended** due to the ban.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antitussive (codeine), antihistamine (chlorpheniramine), expectorant/mucolytic (sodium citrate), topical analgesic/counterirritant (menthol).
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination worked through multiple pathways:
    * Chlorpheniramine maleate blocked histamine H1 receptors, reducing allergic symptoms.
    * Codeine suppressed the cough reflex by acting on opioid receptors in the central nervous system.
    * Menthol provided a cooling sensation, relieving throat irritation.
    * Sodium citrate thinned and loosened mucus, making it easier to cough up.

## **Alternate Names**

- This combination was marketed under various brand names (see source [9] for some examples).
- Codeine-containing cough syrups are sometimes generically referred to as antitussive syrups or cold and cough syrups.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**
    * Chlorpheniramine: Antagonizes H1 histamine receptors, reducing vascular permeability and smooth muscle contraction associated with allergic reactions.
    * Codeine: Acts centrally on opioid receptors in the medulla to suppress the cough reflex.  Metabolized to morphine, contributing to analgesic and other opioid effects.
    * Menthol: Stimulates cold receptors, creating a cooling sensation.  Mild local anesthetic and antipruritic effects.
    * Sodium Citrate: Increases hydration of respiratory secretions, reducing viscosity and promoting expectoration.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    * Absorption: Orally absorbed.
    * Metabolism: Codeine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 in the liver. Chlorpheniramine also undergoes hepatic metabolism.
    * Elimination: Both codeine and chlorpheniramine are primarily excreted by the kidneys.
