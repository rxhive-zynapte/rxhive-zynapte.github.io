## **Usage**

Chlorpheniramine + Codeine is prescribed for the relief of cough and symptoms associated with upper respiratory tract allergies or the common cold in adults.  It is classified as a narcotic antitussive/antihistamine combination. The medication combines the antitussive (cough-suppressing) effects of codeine with the antihistaminic effects of chlorpheniramine to alleviate cold and allergy symptoms.


## **Alternate Names**

**Generic Names:** Codeine/chlorpheniramine, codeine phosphate/chlorpheniramine maleate

**Brand Names:** Tuxarin ER, Tuzistra XR


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Codeine acts centrally on the cough center in the medulla to suppress the cough reflex. It is an opioid agonist that binds to mu-opioid receptors. Chlorpheniramine is an H1-receptor antagonist that competes with histamine for receptor sites, reducing allergy symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Codeine:** It is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Codeine is metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6, to morphine, its active metabolite. It is excreted mainly by the kidneys.
* **Chlorpheniramine:** Well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine.

**Elimination Pathways:** Both drugs are primarily eliminated through hepatic (liver) metabolism and renal (kidney) excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One extended-release tablet every 12 hours; not to exceed two tablets in 24 hours.

#### **Children:**

Safety and efficacy not established in patients younger than 18 years.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose selection should be made with caution due to potential age-related decline in hepatic and renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised and dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution due to the risk of decreased metabolism.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with asthma, hypothyroidism, Addison's disease, prostatic hypertrophy, or urethral stricture.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This drug is not typically used in the context of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary indication is the symptomatic relief of cough and upper respiratory symptoms associated with allergies or the common cold.  Other medications are more appropriate for the listed clinical use cases.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be required for patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Individual patient factors should be considered when determining the appropriate dose.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Sedation (somnolence, mental clouding, lethargy), impaired mental and physical performance, lightheadedness, dizziness, headache, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, constipation, shortness of breath, and sweating.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Respiratory depression, confusion, serotonin syndrome, hallucinations, adrenal insufficiency, severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).

### **Long-Term Effects**

Constipation, dependence, and tolerance with prolonged use of codeine.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Respiratory depression, anaphylaxis, serotonin syndrome.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to codeine or chlorpheniramine.
* Post-operative pain management in children who have undergone tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy.
* Patients with severe respiratory depression or acute or severe bronchial asthma.
* Gastrointestinal obstruction.



## **Drug Interactions**

* **CNS Depressants:** Alcohol, benzodiazepines, other opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, or other CNS depressants can potentiate the sedative effects of Chlorpheniramine + Codeine and should be avoided.
* **MAO Inhibitors:** Avoid concurrent use due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.
* **Anticholinergic Drugs:**  Can enhance anticholinergic side effects like dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention.
* **CYP2D6 Inhibitors/Inducers:** May affect codeine metabolism and its efficacy.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy:** Codeine use during pregnancy can result in neonatal respiratory depression and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. Use only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.

**Breastfeeding:** Codeine is excreted in breast milk and can cause adverse effects in nursing infants. Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking this medication.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Codeine: Centrally acting opioid antitussive. Chlorpheniramine: H1-receptor antagonist.
* **Side Effects:** Sedation, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, respiratory depression.
* **Contraindications:** Respiratory depression, hypersensitivity, post-tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy pain in children.
* **Drug Interactions:** CNS depressants, MAO inhibitors, anticholinergic drugs.
