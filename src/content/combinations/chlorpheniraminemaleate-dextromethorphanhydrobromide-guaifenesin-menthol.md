## Usage
- This combination medication is prescribed for the temporary relief of cough and upper respiratory symptoms, including nasal congestion, associated with the common cold or allergies.  It is also used as an expectorant to treat coughs by thinning and loosening mucus in the airways.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing a first-generation antihistamine (chlorpheniramine), a cough suppressant (dextromethorphan), an expectorant (guaifenesin), and a topical anesthetic/cooling agent (menthol).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Chlorpheniramine blocks histamine H1 receptors, reducing allergic symptoms. Dextromethorphan suppresses the cough reflex in the brain. Guaifenesin thins and loosens mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up. Menthol provides a cooling sensation and soothes irritated airways.

## Alternate Names
- This combination, as it contains menthol and lacks phenylephrine, does not have a universally recognized International Nonproprietary Name (INN). The individual components have the following INNs: chlorpheniramine maleate, dextromethorphan hydrobromide, guaifenesin, and menthol.
- **Brand Names:**  Numerous brand names exist for similar combinations (often including phenylephrine), but one specific brand matching this exact combination with menthol and without phenylephrine is harder to pinpoint and may vary regionally.  Always verify the exact composition of any specific brand-name product. A combination syrup named Cofgel was mentioned in the sources.


## How It Works
- **Pharmacodynamics:** Chlorpheniramine reduces allergic symptoms (sneezing, runny nose, watery eyes) by antagonizing histamine H1 receptors. Dextromethorphan acts centrally in the medulla to suppress the cough reflex. Guaifenesin increases respiratory tract fluid secretions, making mucus less viscous and easier to expectorate.  Menthol acts on cold-sensing TRPM8 receptors, providing a cooling sensation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - *Absorption:* Chlorpheniramine is well-absorbed orally. Dextromethorphan is also absorbed orally and undergoes first-pass metabolism. Guaifenesin is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Menthol is absorbed through the mucous membranes.
    - *Metabolism:* Chlorpheniramine and dextromethorphan are metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP450 enzymes.  Guaifenesin is also metabolized in the liver.
    - *Elimination:*  The metabolites of chlorpheniramine, dextromethorphan, and guaifenesin are primarily excreted in urine. Menthol is mainly excreted in urine and feces.
- **Mode of Action:** Chlorpheniramine competes with histamine for H1 receptor sites. Dextromethorphan acts centrally on sigma opioid receptors and NMDA glutamate receptors in the cough center. Guaifenesin may stimulate gastric vagal receptors, indirectly increasing respiratory tract secretions. Menthol activates TRPM8 receptors.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for all components after hepatic metabolism.

## Dosage
### Standard Dosage
#### Adults:
- Adults and children 12 years and older:  One to two teaspoonfuls (5-10 mL) every 4-6 hours.
