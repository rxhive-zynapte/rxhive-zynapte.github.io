## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the temporary relief of symptoms associated with the common cold, the flu, allergies, hay fever, and other upper respiratory allergies, such as:

*   Cough
*   Runny nose
*   Sneezing
*   Itching of the nose or throat
*   Itchy, watery eyes
*   Nasal congestion

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This drug is a combination of:

*   **Antihistamine** (Chlorpheniramine Maleate)
*   **Cough suppressant** (Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide)
*   **Decongestant** (Phenylephrine)
*   **Cooling agent** (Menthol)

**Mechanism of Action:**

*   **Chlorpheniramine maleate:**  Blocks the action of histamine, a chemical mediator responsible for allergic symptoms.
*   **Dextromethorphan hydrobromide:** Suppresses the cough reflex by acting on the cough center in the brain.
*   **Phenylephrine:** Constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
*   **Menthol:** Provides a cooling sensation, soothing irritated throat tissues.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for this specific four-ingredient combination.  However, each individual ingredient may be referred to by its chemical name or other synonyms.  The combination is often described by listing the generic names of its components. Several brand names exist for various combinations of these ingredients.



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

*   **Chlorpheniramine:**  Reduces histamine-mediated responses such as sneezing, itching, rhinorrhea, and lacrimation. It has mild anticholinergic and sedative effects.
*   **Dextromethorphan:** Elevates the cough threshold in the medulla oblongata without causing analgesia or respiratory depression at recommended doses.
*   **Phenylephrine:** Produces vasoconstriction, primarily in the nasal mucosa, leading to decongestion. It has less pressor activity than other sympathomimetics.
*   **Menthol:** Activates TRPM8 receptors, leading to a cooling sensation. It also has mild local anesthetic and anti-inflammatory effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Chlorpheniramine:** Absorbed well orally. Metabolized extensively in the liver and excreted primarily in urine.
*   **Dextromethorphan:** Well-absorbed orally. Extensively metabolized by the liver (CYP2D6), with some metabolites contributing to antitussive activity. Excreted in urine.
*   **Phenylephrine:** Absorbed orally, but undergoes first-pass metabolism.  Metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the intestine and liver. Excreted in urine.
*   **Menthol:** Absorbed readily through skin and mucous membranes.  Metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and bile.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**

*   **Chlorpheniramine:** H1 receptor antagonist.
*   **Dextromethorphan:**  NMDA receptor antagonist (at high doses); sigma-1 receptor agonist; may inhibit serotonin reuptake.
*   **Phenylephrine:** Î±1-adrenergic receptor agonist.

**Elimination Pathways:**

*   **Chlorpheniramine:** Primarily renal excretion.
*   **Dextromethorphan:** Renal excretion, after hepatic metabolism (CYP2D6).
*   **Phenylephrine:** Renal excretion after MAO metabolism.
*   **Menthol:** Hepatic metabolism, followed by renal and biliary excretion.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* Syrup: 10 mL every 4 to 6 hours, not to exceed 60 mL in 24 hours.

#### **Children:**

* 2 to 6 years: 2.5 mL every 4 to 6 hours, not to exceed 15 mL in 24 hours.
* 6 to 12 years: 5 mL every 4 to 6 hours, not to exceed 30 mL in 24 hours.

**Pediatric Safety Considerations:** Not recommended for children under 2 years of age. Use with caution in atopic children due to the potential for histamine release with dextromethorphan.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and titrate cautiously due to potential for increased sensitivity.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution and consider dose reduction due to the extensive hepatic metabolism of the ingredients.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, hyperthyroidism, increased intraocular pressure, prostatic hypertrophy, asthma, or narrow-angle glaucoma.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Menthol + Phenylephrine is typically not used in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU. Its usage is generally limited to outpatient treatment of common cold and allergy symptoms.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary based on patient response, age, and the presence of renal or hepatic impairment.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Drowsiness or dizziness
*   Dry mouth, nose, or throat
*   Nausea or vomiting
*   Blurred vision
*   Constipation
*   Headache
*   Nervousness or excitability (especially in children)



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Allergic reactions (e.g., hives, difficulty breathing, swelling)
*   Seizures
*   Hallucinations
*   Rapid or irregular heartbeat
*   Severe dizziness


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic complications are unlikely with short-term use. Prolonged use of phenylephrine can lead to rebound congestion.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Serious ADRs are rare but may include hypersensitivity reactions, cardiac arrhythmias, and CNS effects like seizures.


## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.
*   Concurrent or recent use of MAO inhibitors (within 14 days).
*   Severe hypertension or coronary artery disease.
*   Narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, or severe asthma.


## **Drug Interactions**

*   MAO inhibitors (e.g., selegiline, phenelzine):  Hypertensive crisis.
*   Other sympathomimetics (e.g., epinephrine, pseudoephedrine): Increased risk of cardiovascular effects.
*   Beta-blockers and antihypertensives: Reduced efficacy.
*   Alcohol and CNS depressants: Additive sedative effects.
*   Antihistamines: Increased anticholinergic effects.
*   Tricyclic antidepressants: Increased anticholinergic and sedative effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (Dextromethorphan and Phenylephrine); B (Chlorpheniramine).

*   Not recommended during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus.
*   Use during the third trimester may cause reactions in newborns.
