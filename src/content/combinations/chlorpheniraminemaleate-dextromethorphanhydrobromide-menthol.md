## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the relief of symptoms associated with the common cold and flu, such as cough, sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes.  Dextromethorphan works as a cough suppressant, chlorpheniramine as an antihistamine, and menthol as a topical anesthetic and decongestant.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antitussive, antihistamine, decongestant.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dextromethorphan acts centrally in the medulla to elevate the cough threshold. Chlorpheniramine competes with histamine for H1-receptor sites on effector cells in the respiratory tract, blood vessels, and gastrointestinal smooth muscle. Menthol acts on cold-sensitive receptors in the skin and mucosa, producing a cooling sensation and mild decongestant effect.

## **Alternate Names**

-  No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination, though individual components have other names (e.g., dextromethorphan polistirex).
- **Brand Names:**  This combination is marketed under various brand names such as Vicks DayQuil and NyQuil Severe Cold & Flu (though these often contain additional active ingredients).  Always verify the composition of a specific product.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dextromethorphan suppresses the cough reflex.  Chlorpheniramine reduces histamine-mediated symptoms like sneezing, rhinorrhea, and lacrimation. Menthol produces a cooling sensation and may mildly constrict blood vessels in the nasal mucosa.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  All three components are absorbed orally. Dextromethorphan undergoes first-pass metabolism.
    - **Metabolism:** Dextromethorphan is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6. Chlorpheniramine is also metabolized hepatically. Menthol is metabolized to menthol glucuronide.
    - **Elimination:** Metabolites are primarily excreted renally.
- **Mode of Action:** Dextromethorphan acts on sigma opioid receptors and NMDA receptors in the CNS.  Chlorpheniramine is an inverse agonist at the H1 histamine receptor. Menthol activates TRPM8 receptors (transient receptor potential melastatin 8), producing a cooling sensation.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Dextromethorphan acts on sigma opioid receptors (though it lacks typical opioid effects) and NMDA receptors. Chlorpheniramine blocks H1 receptors.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  One or two tablets/capsules (or as directed on the product packaging) every 4-6 hours, as needed. Maximum daily dosage varies based on specific formulation.

#### **Children:** Consult a healthcare professional for pediatric dosing guidelines.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Lower initial doses may be appropriate.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary based on creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Reduce dose due to altered metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or respiratory conditions.
