## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the temporary relief of symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, or upper respiratory allergies, such as cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, itchy or watery eyes, headache, body aches, and fever.  It is particularly effective in managing non-productive, irritating coughs.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This drug combines several therapeutic classes:
    - **Antihistamine** (Chlorpheniramine Maleate)
    - **Cough Suppressant** (Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide)
    - **Analgesic and Antipyretic** (Paracetamol)
- **Mechanism of Action:** Chlorpheniramine maleate provides relief from allergy symptoms by blocking the action of histamine. Dextromethorphan hydrobromide suppresses cough by acting on the cough center in the brain. Paracetamol reduces fever and relieves pain by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.

## **Alternate Names**

- While the generic name is Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Paracetamol, some variations may exist internationally. Additionally, phenylephrine hydrochloride can be included in some formulations.
- **Brand Names:**  This combination is available under various brand names (depending on the region and specific formulation), including Coricidin, Tylenol Cold, and Dimetapp.  A large number of brand names exist in various countries given that it is available as an over-the-counter product.  Always consult local or regional formularies for the available brand names in a given area.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Chlorpheniramine acts as an H1-receptor antagonist, competing with histamine and reducing allergy symptoms. Dextromethorphan acts centrally to suppress the cough reflex. Paracetamol inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, which reduces fever and pain.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  All three components are well-absorbed orally. Paracetamol is metabolized in the liver, primarily by glucuronidation and sulfation, with a small fraction undergoing CYP450-mediated metabolism. Chlorpheniramine is also metabolized in the liver, and dextromethorphan is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6.  All three drugs are primarily eliminated via renal excretion, either as parent drug or metabolites.
- **Mode of Action:**  
    - Chlorpheniramine: Competitive inhibition of histamine at H1 receptors.
    - Dextromethorphan:  Acts centrally on the cough center in the medulla.
    - Paracetamol: Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis.  The exact mechanism of its analgesic action is not fully elucidated but likely involves central and possibly spinal pathways.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for all three components, with a small fraction of paracetamol excreted in the bile.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  One tablet/capsule or 15 mL of syrup every 4-6 hours as needed. Do not exceed the maximum daily dose (which varies by formulation and manufacturer - but can be approximated at Paracetamol 4g, Chlorpheniramine 24 mg, Dextromethorphan 120mg).

#### **Children:** Dosing varies depending on age and formulation. Consult a pediatrician.  Generally this medication is avoided in children under 6.  Dosing references in certain texts may be available for children as young as 2, though toxicity is a concern in children younger than 4, thus prescribing should be undertaken with extreme caution. Do not administer formulations with phenylephrine in patients under the age of 4.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose due to potential age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment is necessary. Consider creatinine clearance when determining dose and frequency.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Reduce dosage due to impaired metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, and other conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication is **not** typically used in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its usage is primarily limited to outpatient symptomatic relief of cold and flu symptoms.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are based on patient-specific factors including renal/hepatic dysfunction, age, and other comorbidities.  Consult specific dosing guidelines and resources, such as the Cockcroft-Gault or CKD-EPI equations, when adjusting doses based on kidney function.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
- Drowsiness, dizziness
- Dry mouth, nose, and throat
- Nausea, vomiting
- Constipation
- Blurred vision
- Headache
- Restlessness or excitability (especially in children)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, trouble breathing)
- Seizures, hallucinations, confusion
- Fast/irregular heartbeat
- Difficulty urinating


### **Long-Term Effects:**  Generally, this combination is not intended for long-term use. Chronic use of paracetamol can lead to liver damage, especially at high doses.  Antihistamines, when used chronically, can lead to tolerance.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Any signs of hypersensitivity or severe side effects as listed above.



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any of the components.
- Severe hypertension or coronary artery disease.
- Narrow-angle glaucoma.
- Urinary retention, prostatic hypertrophy.
- Asthma, severe respiratory disease.
- Concurrent use of MAOIs.
- Patients with G6PD deficiency should avoid or use paracetamol with extreme caution, though some sources indicate only sensitivity to excessive doses.


## **Drug Interactions**

- MAOIs: Avoid concurrent use or within 14 days of MAOI discontinuation.
- Alcohol, sedatives, tranquilizers:  Increased drowsiness.
- Antidepressants (SSRIs, tricyclics):  Potential for serotonin syndrome or increased sedation.
- Other anticholinergic drugs: Additive anticholinergic effects.
- Muscle relaxants: Increased sedation.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Consult a physician. Use only if clearly needed.  Limited data are available regarding safety in pregnancy.
- **Breastfeeding:** Not recommended due to potential adverse effects on infants and potential for decreased milk production.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  See above.
- **Side Effects:** See above.
- **Contraindications:** See above.
- **Drug Interactions:** See above.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  See above.
- **Dosage:** See above.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests (with chronic paracetamol use), renal function, vital signs.


## **Popular Combinations**

- This combination itself is a popular one.  The addition of phenylephrine hydrochloride to address nasal congestion is also commonly found.


## **Precautions**

- Assess for allergies, pre-existing conditions (especially those listed in contraindications).
- Avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants.
- Caution with driving or operating machinery.
- Monitor for adverse reactions.
