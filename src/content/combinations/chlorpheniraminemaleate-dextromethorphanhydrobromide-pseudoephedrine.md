## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the temporary relief of symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, and upper respiratory allergies, such as:

*   Cough
*   Nasal congestion
*   Runny nose
*   Sneezing
*   Itchy and watery eyes
*   Itching of the nose or throat

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This drug is a combination of an antihistamine (chlorpheniramine), a cough suppressant (dextromethorphan), and a decongestant (pseudoephedrine).

**Mechanism of Action:**

*   **Chlorpheniramine:** Blocks the action of histamine, reducing allergy symptoms.
*   **Dextromethorphan:** Suppresses the cough reflex by acting on the cough center in the brain.
*   **Pseudoephedrine:** Constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.

## **Alternate Names**

The combination itself does not have a specific international nonproprietary name (INN). It is identified by its component drugs. Some common brand names this combination might be marketed under are:

*   Kidkare Cough/Cold
*   Rescon DM
*   Triaminic Cough and Cold
*   Vicks Formula 44M



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

*   **Chlorpheniramine:** Competes with histamine for H1-receptor sites, reducing the effects of histamine release.
*   **Dextromethorphan:** Acts centrally on the medulla oblongata to elevate the cough threshold. It does not cause significant respiratory depression or addiction at therapeutic doses.
*   **Pseudoephedrine:** Stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors in the respiratory tract, causing vasoconstriction.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Chlorpheniramine:** Well-absorbed orally, metabolized primarily in the liver, and excreted mainly in the urine.
*   **Dextromethorphan:** Well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, with a significant portion converted to the active metabolite dextrorphan. Excretion is primarily through the kidneys.
*   **Pseudoephedrine:** Readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, partially metabolized in the liver, and excreted mostly unchanged in the urine.


**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**

*   Chlorpheniramine: H1-receptor antagonist (blocker).
*   Dextromethorphan: Sigma-1 receptor agonist, NMDA receptor antagonist (weak), serotonin reuptake inhibitor (weak).
*   Pseudoephedrine: Alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for all three components, with hepatic metabolism also contributing.
