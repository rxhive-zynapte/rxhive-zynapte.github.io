## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the temporary relief of symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, and allergies.  It addresses symptoms like fever, headache, body aches, nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, watery eyes, and itchy eyes. Additionally, due to the presence of diclofenac, it can provide relief from pain associated with conditions like toothache, neck pain, or arthritic pain.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing drugs from different classifications:
    - Analgesic (Paracetamol, Diclofenac)
    - Antipyretic (Paracetamol, Diclofenac)
    - Antihistamine (Chlorpheniramine)
    - Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID) (Diclofenac)
    - Antacid (Magnesium Trisilicate)

- **Mechanism of Action:**  This combination works through multiple pathways:
    - Paracetamol reduces fever and pain by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the central nervous system, primarily COX-3, reducing prostaglandin synthesis.
    - Diclofenac is an NSAID that inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, further reducing pain and inflammation.
    - Chlorpheniramine is an antihistamine that blocks the action of histamine, relieving allergy symptoms.
    - Magnesium trisilicate acts as an antacid, neutralizing excess stomach acid and providing relief from heartburn and indigestion.


## **Alternate Names**

- Cold Relief Tablets

- **Brand Names:**
    - Clodip Tablet
    - Dacron Plus Tablet
    - Dolopee Tablet
    - DPC Tablet
    - Geodic MR Tablet
    - Insta Relief Tablet
    - Labdic Tablet
    - Labdic Relief Tablet
    - Paindoz Tablet
    - Paingesic Tablet


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  The combination exerts its effects through the combined actions of its components. Diclofenac, by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2, reduces inflammation and pain. Paracetamol primarily affects central COX enzymes, resulting in pain and fever reduction. Chlorpheniramine antagonizes histamine H1 receptors, reducing allergy symptoms.  Magnesium trisilicate neutralizes gastric acid.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - *Absorption:*  All components are absorbed orally, though Diclofenac absorption can be affected by food.
    - *Metabolism:* Primarily hepatic metabolism, mainly through the CYP450 system, especially for Diclofenac and Chlorpheniramine.  Paracetamol undergoes glucuronidation and sulfation.
    - *Elimination:* Primarily renal excretion for all components and their metabolites.

- **Mode of Action:**
    - Diclofenac and Paracetamol reduce prostaglandin synthesis.
    - Chlorpheniramine competitively inhibits histamine at H1 receptors.
    - Magnesium Trisilicate chemically neutralizes stomach acid.

- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**
    - Diclofenac and Paracetamol: COX-1, COX-2 (Diclofenac), and COX-3 (Paracetamol) enzyme inhibition.
    - Chlorpheniramine: Histamine H1 receptor antagonist.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.  Hepatic metabolism plays a significant role, especially for Diclofenac, via CYP enzymes.
