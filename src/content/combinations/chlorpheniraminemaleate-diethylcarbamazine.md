## **Usage**

Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Diethylcarbamazine is prescribed for the treatment of certain parasitic worm infections, most notably lymphatic filariasis (also known as elephantiasis) caused by *Wuchereria bancrofti*, *Brugia malayi*, or *Brugia timori*.  It is also used for loiasis (caused by *Loa loa*),  *Mansonella streptocerca* infections, tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, and visceral larva migrans.

This combination medication falls under the **pharmacological classification** of antiparasitic and antihistamine.

The diethylcarbamazine component works by immobilizing and disrupting the metabolism of the microfilariae (larval stage of the parasite), making them susceptible to the host's immune system.  Chlorpheniramine, an antihistamine, mitigates the allergic reactions (itching, swelling, hives) that can occur when the parasites die and release inflammatory substances.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate generic names for this combination. However, numerous **brand names** exist depending on the manufacturer and geographical region. Some examples include DC Forte, Unicarbazan Forte, and Dec Tablet.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Diethylcarbamazine affects the parasites by altering their outer membrane and decreasing their muscular activity, leading to paralysis and death.  Chlorpheniramine acts as an H1-receptor antagonist, blocking the effects of histamine, a chemical mediator responsible for allergic symptoms.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Diethylcarbamazine is well-absorbed orally and widely distributed in the body. It is metabolized in the liver and primarily excreted in the urine.  Chlorpheniramine is also absorbed well orally, metabolized in the liver by CYP enzymes, and excreted in the urine.

**Mode of Action:** Diethylcarbamazine disrupts the worm's metabolic processes, making it more susceptible to attack by the host's immune system.  It may also inhibit arachidonic acid metabolism in the parasite. Chlorpheniramine competitively binds to H1 histamine receptors, preventing histamine from binding and eliciting its effects.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Both drugs are primarily eliminated through renal excretion following hepatic metabolism.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The typical dosage for filariasis, loiasis, and river blindness is 2-3 mg/kg of body weight three times daily, taken after meals. For tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, the dosage is 6 mg/kg daily, divided into three doses, for 14 days.  For visceral larva migrans, it is 6 mg/kg daily, divided into three doses, for 7-10 days.

#### **Children:**

Pediatric dosage is usually based on weight, starting at 1 mg/kg on the first day and gradually increasing to 6 mg/kg daily, divided into three doses.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Caution is advised due to potential age-related decrease in renal and hepatic function. Dose adjustment may be necessary.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be required in patients with significant renal dysfunction.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advised. Dose adjustment might be needed.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is warranted in patients with asthma, glaucoma, urinary retention, or an enlarged prostate.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage for specific medical settings is not specifically outlined in the sources. Dosage is usually determined by the type and severity of the parasitic infection.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on patient-specific factors, including renal and hepatic function. Patients with impaired renal function typically require a dose reduction.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, headache, drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, blurred vision, and allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), seizures, encephalopathy, and ocular complications (night blindness, vision loss).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term use, especially in high doses, can potentially cause vision problems. Regular eye check-ups are advised during prolonged therapy.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to diethylcarbamazine or chlorpheniramine, asthma, and severe renal impairment.

## **Drug Interactions**

Antihistamines (including topical antihistamines), CNS depressants (alcohol, opioids, sedatives, muscle relaxants), and certain antidepressants.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been definitively established.  The potential benefits must be weighed against the potential risks.  It is generally advisable to avoid using this medication during pregnancy unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks, as per the doctor's advice. Use with caution during breastfeeding as it may pass into breast milk.
