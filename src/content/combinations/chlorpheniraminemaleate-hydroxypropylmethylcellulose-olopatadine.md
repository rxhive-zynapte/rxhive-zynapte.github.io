## **Usage**

This ophthalmic solution is prescribed for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. It alleviates ocular symptoms associated with eye allergies, such as itching, redness, watering, and burning.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antihistamine, Decongestant, Lubricant.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination drug uses a dual antihistamine approach (Olopatadine and Chlorpheniramine Maleate) with the added benefit of a lubricant (Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose). Olopatadine and Chlorpheniramine Maleate block histamine receptors, reducing the effects of histamine, a chemical mediator responsible for allergic symptoms. Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose provides soothing relief and moisture to irritated eyes.

## **Alternate Names**

- Olomin Eye Drop
- Olomin


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Olopatadine and Chlorpheniramine Maleate are H1-receptor antagonists, inhibiting the effects of histamine.  Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose lubricates the ocular surface.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Olopatadine has limited systemic absorption after topical ocular administration. Chlorpheniramine Maleate absorption is also minimal. Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose exerts its effect locally and does not have systemic effects. Elimination pathways have not been fully characterized for all ingredients.
- **Mode of Action:** At the cellular level, both Olopatadine and Chlorpheniramine Maleate competitively bind to histamine H1 receptors, preventing histamine from binding and triggering the allergic cascade. This leads to a reduction in vasodilation, itching, and other allergic manifestations. Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose increases the viscosity of the tear film, improving lubrication and reducing friction on the ocular surface.  
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** The primary mechanism is competitive antagonism of the histamine H1 receptor.
