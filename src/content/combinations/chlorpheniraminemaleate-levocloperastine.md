## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of dry cough.  It is also sometimes used to alleviate cough associated with allergies.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antitussive (Levocloperastine) and Antihistamine (Chlorpheniramine Maleate)
- **Mechanism of Action:** Levocloperastine suppresses cough by acting on the cough center in the brain. Chlorpheniramine maleate provides relief from allergy symptoms, which may contribute to cough, by blocking the action of histamine.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names for this specific combination exist.
- **Brand Names:**  Lupituss CPM, Asvitus-LC, Dropolev (with Levodropropizine, a similar antitussive)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Levocloperastine acts centrally on the cough center in the medulla oblongata, reducing the urge to cough. Chlorpheniramine maleate antagonizes the H1 histamine receptor, reducing the effects of histamine release, such as sneezing, runny nose, and watery eyes.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Both drugs are absorbed orally.  Levocloperastine's metabolism and elimination pathways are not fully elucidated. Chlorpheniramine is metabolized in the liver and primarily excreted renally.
- **Mode of Action:** Levocloperastine peripherally blocks cough receptors while acting centrally on the cough center in the brain. Chlorpheniramine maleate competes with histamine for H1-receptor sites on effector cells, thus preventing the effects of histamine.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Levocloperastine affects peripheral cough receptors and central cough centers, without significant respiratory depression. Chlorpheniramine competitively binds to H1 receptors.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Levocloperastine's elimination is not fully characterized. Chlorpheniramine is metabolized in the liver, likely involving CYP450 enzymes, and primarily excreted in the urine.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The typical adult dosage is 20 mg levocloperastine and 4 mg chlorpheniramine maleate, administered orally, two to three times daily. Do not exceed 60 mg of levocloperastine per day.

#### **Children:**

- The dosage should be adjusted based on the child's age and weight and is typically 1 mg of levocloperastine per kg of body weight, thrice daily. Its use is generally not recommended for children under 8 years old, and caution should be used in children under 12 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Start with lower doses due to potential increased sensitivity to side effects like drowsiness and confusion.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution is advised, and dose adjustment might be needed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution and dose adjustments are necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring is warranted, especially for patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, or hyperthyroidism.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- The combination is not typically indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its use is primarily for symptomatic relief of dry cough.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjust based on patient response and tolerance, considering renal and hepatic function, comorbid conditions, and drug interactions.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Drowsiness, dizziness, headache, nausea, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), difficulty breathing, irregular heartbeat, seizures.

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Not well established, but potential for dependence with prolonged use of certain antitussives should be considered.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe allergic reactions, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to levocloperastine or chlorpheniramine, pregnancy, concurrent use of MAO inhibitors, severe respiratory compromise,  narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, prostatic hypertrophy.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Alcohol, other CNS depressants (e.g., sedatives, hypnotics, opioids), antihistamines, MAO inhibitors, medications metabolized by CYP450 enzymes.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Not established for levocloperastine. Chlorpheniramine is generally considered Category B but should be used cautiously.
- **Fetal Risks:** Potential for adverse effects, though limited data are available.
- **Drug excretion in breast milk:**  Both drugs can be excreted in breast milk, potentially causing drowsiness or other effects in infants.
- **Safer alternatives:**  Dextromethorphan or guaifenesin might be considered as alternatives.

- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, pregnancy, MAOI use.
- **Drug Interactions:** CNS depressants, alcohol, antihistamines.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 20 mg/4mg two to three times daily. Children: Weight-based dosing, not generally recommended for younger children.
