## **Usage**

This ophthalmic solution is prescribed for the temporary relief of symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis, such as redness, itching, burning, tearing, and swelling. It is also used to alleviate minor eye irritation caused by dust, smoke, wind, sun, and other environmental factors.  It combines decongestants, an antihistamine, and cooling agents for synergistic relief. This combination is categorized as a ophthalmic decongestant and antihistamine.

The naphazoline and phenylephrine components act as decongestants, constricting blood vessels in the eye to reduce redness and swelling. Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that blocks the effects of histamine, a chemical mediator responsible for allergic symptoms like itching and tearing.  Menthol provides a cooling sensation, further soothing irritated eyes.

## **Alternate Names**

While there isn't a universally recognized international non-proprietary name (INN) for this specific combination, the individual components are well-established. The combination may be referred to by its constituent drug names or using various brand names.  Some popular brand names include Ocurest-AH and N-Cool.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Naphazoline and phenylephrine are α-adrenergic agonists, primarily stimulating α1-adrenergic receptors in the ocular blood vessels, causing vasoconstriction.  Chlorpheniramine maleate is an H1-receptor antagonist, competitively blocking the binding of histamine to H1 receptors, thereby preventing histamine-mediated vasodilation, capillary permeability, and itching. Menthol acts on cold-sensitive TRPM8 receptors, creating a cooling sensation. Camphor, frequently included in such preparations, similarly activates TRP channels, contributing to the soothing effect.


**Pharmacokinetics:** After topical ophthalmic administration, absorption is minimal, limiting systemic exposure. However, some systemic absorption may occur, especially with frequent or prolonged use. The liver metabolizes chlorpheniramine, and the metabolites are excreted renally. Naphazoline and phenylephrine undergo limited metabolism and are also primarily excreted in urine. Menthol and camphor are rapidly absorbed and metabolized in the liver, with subsequent renal excretion.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Instill 1-2 drops into the affected eye(s) every 4-6 hours as needed.

#### **Children:** Use in children under 6 years of age is generally not recommended without consulting a physician. For children 6 years and older, the same dosage as adults can be used, but close monitoring is advised.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to potential sensitivity to systemic effects, particularly cardiovascular effects of phenylephrine and naphazoline. Monitor blood pressure and intraocular pressure. 
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised as some systemic absorption may occur, leading to accumulation of metabolites. Monitor renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution due to potential impaired metabolism of chlorpheniramine. Monitor liver function tests.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), as the phenylephrine component can exacerbate these conditions. Close monitoring of relevant parameters is necessary.  Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma should avoid this medication.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of this combination in specific clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, and the ICU is not standard practice.  While the medication might be used to alleviate temporary eye irritation or dryness associated with these situations, it is crucial to consider the potential risks, especially in critically ill patients.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be needed based on individual patient response and the presence of comorbid conditions, especially renal or hepatic impairment. Consultation with an ophthalmologist is recommended.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
- Burning or stinging sensation in the eyes
- Blurred vision
- Mydriasis (pupil dilation)
- Rebound congestion (with prolonged use)
- Eye irritation
- Watery eyes
- Headache

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
- Angle-closure glaucoma (in susceptible individuals)
- Hypersensitivity reactions (rash, itching, angioedema, anaphylaxis)
- Cardiovascular effects (hypertension, tachycardia, palpitations)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Prolonged use can lead to rebound congestion, where the nasal passages become more congested than before treatment.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions require immediate medical attention. Angle-closure glaucoma, though rare, can lead to permanent vision loss if not treated promptly. 

## **Contraindications**

- Narrow-angle glaucoma
- Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication
- Patients taking MAO inhibitors (or within 14 days of discontinuing MAOIs)

## **Drug Interactions**

- MAO inhibitors (risk of hypertensive crisis)
- Beta-blockers (may counteract the decongestant effects)
- Tricyclic antidepressants (may enhance pressor response of phenylephrine)
- Other sympathomimetics (e.g., pseudoephedrine; additive effects)
- Antihypertensive medications (may decrease efficacy)
- Alcohol and tobacco (can worsen drowsiness and dizziness)


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been definitively established. Use with caution and only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Consult with an obstetrician or pediatrician.
