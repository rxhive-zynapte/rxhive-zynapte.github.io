## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of the common cold, flu, and allergies (allergic rhinitis). It addresses symptoms such as runny nose, stuffy nose, sneezing, cough, sore throat, and watery eyes.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing drugs from different classifications:
    - Chlorpheniramine: Antihistamine (H1 receptor antagonist)
    - Phenylephrine: Decongestant (α1-adrenergic agonist)
    - Sodium Citrate: Expectorant/Mucolytic
    - Menthol: Topical analgesic and counterirritant
- **Mechanism of Action:** Briefly, Chlorpheniramine blocks histamine action, reducing allergy symptoms; Phenylephrine constricts nasal blood vessels, relieving congestion; Sodium Citrate thins mucus, aiding expectoration; and Menthol provides a cooling sensation, soothing throat irritation.

## **Alternate Names**

- No specific alternate generic names exist for this exact combination. However, individual ingredients might have synonyms (e.g., Acetaminophen for Paracetamol).
- **Brand Names:** This combination is marketed under various brand names like Sinarest AF Jr.,  KOLQ Syrup, and others depending on the manufacturer and region.  International and regional brand names may vary.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**
    - **Chlorpheniramine:** Competes with histamine for H1 receptors, reducing vasodilation, capillary permeability, and itching.
    - **Phenylephrine:** Stimulates α1-adrenergic receptors in nasal mucosa causing vasoconstriction, thus reducing congestion.
    - **Sodium Citrate:** Increases bronchial secretions, making mucus less viscous and facilitating its removal.
    - **Menthol:** Activates TRPM8 receptors, creating a cooling sensation and acting as a counterirritant to relieve minor throat irritation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Chlorpheniramine:** Well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver (CYP450 enzymes), and excreted primarily in urine.
    - **Phenylephrine:**  Less well-absorbed orally compared to chlorpheniramine. It undergoes first-pass metabolism. Excreted in urine.
    - **Sodium Citrate:** Absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Excreted renally.
    - **Menthol:** Absorbed through skin and mucous membranes; metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and bile.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, Neurotransmitter Modulation:**
    - Chlorpheniramine: H1 receptor antagonist.
    - Phenylephrine: α1-adrenergic receptor agonist.
    - Menthol: TRPM8 receptor agonist.
- **Elimination Pathways:**
    - Primarily renal excretion for all ingredients, with some hepatic metabolism (especially Chlorpheniramine and Menthol).
