## **Usage**

Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Menthol combinations are primarily used for the symptomatic relief of the common cold and allergies.  Specifically, these medications address symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, watery eyes, itching, and throat irritation.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination includes a first-generation antihistamine (chlorpheniramine maleate) and a counterirritant/local anesthetic (menthol).

- **Mechanism of Action:** Chlorpheniramine maleate competes with histamine for H1-receptor sites, reducing the effects of histamine release associated with allergic reactions. Menthol activates TRPM8 receptors in the skin and mucous membranes, producing a cooling sensation and relieving minor throat irritation.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no formally recognized alternate names for this specific drug combination, as it's often marketed under various brand names.

- **Brand Names:**  Brand names may vary regionally.  It is crucial to refer to local pharmaceutical resources for specific brand information in India.  Some brand names may contain additional active ingredients such as paracetamol, phenylephrine, or dextromethorphan.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Chlorpheniramine reduces histamine-mediated responses like vasodilation, capillary permeability, and smooth muscle contraction. Menthol produces a cooling sensation and acts as a mild local anesthetic.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Chlorpheniramine is well-absorbed orally, with peak plasma concentrations achieved within 2-6 hours. It's metabolized in the liver and primarily excreted renally. Menthol is absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes. After absorption or ingestion, it is metabolized by the liver, conjugated with glucuronic acid, and eliminated primarily in the urine.

- **Mode of Action:**  Chlorpheniramine competitively inhibits histamine binding at H1 receptors. Menthol acts as a TRPM8 receptor agonist, leading to a sensation of cold.

- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Chlorpheniramine binds to H1 receptors. Menthol activates TRPM8 receptors.


- **Elimination Pathways:** Chlorpheniramine is primarily eliminated through renal excretion of metabolites. Menthol is eliminated primarily in the urine as glucuronide conjugates.

## **Dosage**

Dosage information is not available for a combination product containing only chlorpheniramine maleate and menthol.  However, dosage information regarding Chlorpheniramine and other combinations is presented.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Chlorpheniramine: 4 mg orally every 4-6 hours, not to exceed 24 mg/day.  Extended-release formulations are also available.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Lower doses are recommended due to increased sensitivity to anticholinergic side effects. Start with 4 mg orally every 12 hours or 8 mg sustained-release at bedtime.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution and consider dose adjustments.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution and consider dose adjustments.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, or bladder neck obstruction.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of chlorpheniramine and menthol is typically not used in clinical settings like intubation, surgery, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU.
