## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily used as a decongestant and antihistamine for the relief of symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis, such as redness, itching, tearing, and swelling of the eyes.  It belongs to the pharmacological classifications of ophthalmic decongestants, antihistamines, and lubricants.

The naphazoline component is a sympathomimetic amine that acts as a vasoconstrictor, reducing eye redness and swelling.  Chlorpheniramine maleate is an antihistamine that blocks the effects of histamine, relieving itching and tearing. Methylcellulose acts as a lubricant, providing soothing relief to irritated eyes. Phenylmercuric nitrate is a preservative.

## **Alternate Names**

There isn't one single international non-proprietary name (INN) for this specific combination product. The components will be listed separately (e.g., naphazoline hydrochloride, chlorpheniramine maleate). Brand names vary depending on the region and manufacturer.  Some examples include Naphcon-A, Vasocon-A, and Ocuhist.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Naphazoline stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors in the blood vessels of the conjunctiva, causing vasoconstriction. This leads to a decrease in ocular blood flow and reduces redness and edema. Chlorpheniramine maleate competes with histamine for H1-receptor sites, effectively blocking histamine's effects on the conjunctiva, thus reducing itching, tearing, and other allergic manifestations.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Naphazoline and chlorpheniramine maleate are absorbed into the systemic circulation to some extent after topical ophthalmic administration.  Methylcellulose, due to its high molecular weight, is not systemically absorbed. Phenylmercuric nitrate may be absorbed to a limited degree. Metabolism and elimination pathways for naphazoline and chlorpheniramine are primarily hepatic.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Instill 1-2 drops in the affected eye(s) every 3-4 hours as needed.

#### **Children:**  Use in children is generally not recommended unless under the direct supervision of a physician. For children over six years of age, the dosage is typically the same as for adults, while for younger children, a lower dose may be prescribed.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and titrate upwards as needed based on individual response and tolerance. Closely monitor for systemic side effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised, and dosage adjustments may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution, as these drugs are primarily metabolized in the liver. Dosage adjustment may be required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, or closed-angle glaucoma.




## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects**

* Transient stinging or burning upon instillation
* Pupil dilation (mydriasis)
* Rebound congestion with prolonged use
* Blurred vision


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Systemic effects such as increased blood pressure, tachycardia, headache, and dizziness can occur, particularly with excessive use or in susceptible individuals.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) are rare but require immediate medical intervention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication.
* Narrow-angle glaucoma.
* Use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).

## **Drug Interactions**

* MAOIs can potentiate the pressor effects of naphazoline, leading to a hypertensive crisis.
* Other sympathomimetics may have additive effects and should be used with caution.
* Anticholinergic medications may exacerbate mydriasis.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Safety during these periods has not been definitively established.  Discuss risks and benefits with a physician before use.
