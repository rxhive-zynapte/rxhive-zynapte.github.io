## **Usage**

This ophthalmic solution is prescribed for temporary relief of redness, itching, burning, and discomfort associated with allergic conjunctivitis, hay fever, and other minor eye irritations, such as those caused by smog, swimming, or contact lenses. It also helps relieve dryness of the eye.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing:

* **Naphazoline:** Decongestant (alpha-adrenergic agonist)
* **Chlorpheniramine:** Antihistamine (H1-receptor antagonist)
* **Methylcellulose:** Lubricant/demulcent
* **Zinc Sulfate:** Astringent

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination offers a multimodal action:

* **Naphazoline:** Constricts blood vessels in the conjunctiva, reducing redness and swelling.
* **Chlorpheniramine:** Blocks histamine receptors, relieving itching, watering, and other allergic symptoms.
* **Methylcellulose:** Provides lubrication and soothes irritated eyes.
* **Zinc Sulfate:** Acts as an astringent, further reducing redness and irritation.

## **Alternate Names**

* Naphazoline/Chlorpheniramine/Methylcellulose/Zinc Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution
* Various brand names exist (e.g., Nefacool, I-Kul Plus, Irrinil).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Naphazoline:**  Alpha-adrenergic agonist causing vasoconstriction in the eye, reducing redness.
* **Chlorpheniramine:** Competitive histamine H1-receptor antagonist, blocking histamine-mediated allergic responses.
* **Methylcellulose:** Increases tear film viscosity, providing lubrication.
* **Zinc Sulfate:**  Astringent action constricts superficial tissues, reducing eye redness and discharge.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Minimal systemic absorption of naphazoline and chlorpheniramine after topical ophthalmic administration. Methylcellulose and zinc sulfate are not systemically absorbed.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily hepatic metabolism for the small amounts of naphazoline and chlorpheniramine that are absorbed.
* **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Instill 1-2 drops in the affected eye(s) every 3-4 hours as needed. Do not exceed 6 doses per day.

#### **Children:**

Use in children under 6 years of age is generally not recommended. For children 6 years and older, use adult dosing unless otherwise directed by a physician. Monitor carefully for side effects, particularly drowsiness.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lowest recommended dose and increase cautiously as needed, monitoring for adverse effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, or narrow-angle glaucoma.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU. It is primarily used for the temporary relief of minor eye irritations and allergic conjunctivitis in outpatient or emergency settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient response and tolerance. Carefully monitor patients with renal or hepatic impairment or comorbid conditions.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Temporary blurred vision
* Burning or stinging sensation
* Eye redness or irritation
* Dilated pupils
* Headache
* Drowsiness


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Eye pain
* Vision changes (other than blurred vision)
* Worsening redness/itching/swelling in or around the eyes


### **Long-Term Effects**

Prolonged use, especially of naphazoline, can lead to rebound congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa) â€“ increased redness and swelling when the medication is stopped. Though less common with ophthalmic use than nasal, avoid prolonged or excessive use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

* Angle-closure glaucoma (in susceptible individuals)



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any of the components
* Narrow-angle glaucoma


## **Drug Interactions**
