## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the temporary relief of symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis (pink eye) and other minor eye irritations. These symptoms include redness, itching, burning, watering, and discomfort.  It is also used to alleviate dryness of the eyes.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This drug is a combination of an antihistamine (chlorpheniramine maleate), a decongestant (naphazoline hydrochloride), and a lubricant (methylcellulose).

- **Mechanism of Action:** Chlorpheniramine maleate blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during allergic reactions that causes symptoms like itching and redness. Naphazoline hydrochloride constricts blood vessels in the eye, reducing swelling and redness. Methylcellulose lubricates the eye's surface, relieving dryness and irritation.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no officially recognized alternate names for this specific three-drug combination. However, the individual components may be known by their chemical names or as parts of other brand-name combinations.

- **Brand Names:**  A number of brand names exist for this combination including Eye Cool, MNC Eye Drops, Mezol, Nefacool.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Naphazoline acts as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, constricting blood vessels in the conjunctiva, reducing redness and edema. Chlorpheniramine competitively inhibits histamine H1 receptors, reducing itching, tearing, and other allergic manifestations. Methylcellulose, a demulcent, increases tear viscosity, providing a soothing and lubricating effect.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Naphazoline and chlorpheniramine, when administered topically as eye drops, have minimal systemic absorption. Methylcellulose is not systemically absorbed. Absorbed fractions of naphazoline and chlorpheniramine are metabolized in the liver and excreted via the kidneys.

- **Mode of Action:** Naphazoline stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle, leading to vasoconstriction. Chlorpheniramine competitively blocks histamine at H1 receptors, preventing histamine-induced vasodilation and capillary permeability. Methylcellulose physically lubricates the ocular surface, improving tear film stability.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism and renal excretion for naphazoline and chlorpheniramine.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 1-2 drops in the affected eye(s) every 3-4 hours as needed.

#### **Children:** For children over 6 years of age, the dosage is generally the same as for adults (1-2 drops in affected eye(s) every 3-4 hours), but use should be under the supervision of a doctor. This medication is not recommended for children under 6 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution. Monitor for cardiovascular side effects related to naphazoline.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dosage adjustment may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use cautiously in patients with cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, or narrow-angle glaucoma.
