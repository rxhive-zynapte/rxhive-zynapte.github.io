## **Usage**

Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Naphazoline is prescribed for the temporary relief of redness, itching, and swelling of the eyes due to allergic conjunctivitis caused by allergens such as pollen, ragweed, grass, animal dander, and hair.  It is classified as an ophthalmic decongestant and antihistamine combination.

The mechanism of action involves naphazoline constricting blood vessels in the eye to reduce redness and swelling, while chlorpheniramine blocks the action of histamine, a chemical mediator responsible for allergic symptoms like itching and watering.

## **Alternate Names**

This drug combination is often referred to as naphazoline/pheniramine ophthalmic. Brand names include Naphcon-A, Opcon-A, and Visine-A.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Naphazoline, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, acts as a decongestant by stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors in the blood vessels of the conjunctiva, causing vasoconstriction and reducing eye redness and swelling.  Chlorpheniramine, an H1-receptor antagonist, blocks the effects of histamine at H1 receptors, thereby relieving itching and watering.

**Pharmacokinetics:** After topical ocular administration, naphazoline and chlorpheniramine have minimal systemic absorption. Naphazoline's metabolism and elimination pathways are not fully characterized. Chlorpheniramine is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Instill 1 or 2 drops in the affected eye(s) up to 4 times daily.

#### **Children:**

- **6 years and older:**  Instill 1 or 2 drops in the affected eye(s) up to 4 times daily.
- **Under 6 years:** Not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution. Start with the lowest recommended dose.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, and glaucoma.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication is specifically indicated for allergic conjunctivitis. Its use in other clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations is not established.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be required based on individual patient response and tolerability.  Considerations for renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms should be taken into account.

## **Side Effects**
