## **Usage**

Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Noscapine is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of dry, irritating coughs often associated with the common cold and flu.  It helps alleviate cough associated with chest congestion and a stuffy or runny nose.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination drug falls under two classifications: antihistamine (chlorpheniramine) and antitussive (noscapine).

- **Mechanism of Action:** Chlorpheniramine maleate, an H1 receptor antagonist, works by blocking the effects of histamine, thus reducing allergic symptoms like runny nose and sneezing. Noscapine, a centrally acting antitussive, suppresses the cough reflex by acting on the cough center in the brain, without the opiate-like side effects of codeine.


## **Alternate Names**

There is no widely recognized alternate name for this specific combination. However, variations may exist regionally.  Brand names can vary significantly depending on the manufacturer and country. Some examples include Coscopin Plus and other similar names, though this is not an exhaustive list and brand names change frequently.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Chlorpheniramine reduces the effects of histamine, leading to a decrease in nasal secretions, sneezing, and itching.  Noscapine acts centrally to suppress the cough reflex.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Chlorpheniramine:** Absorbed well orally. Metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP450 enzymes. Excreted mainly through the kidneys.
    - **Noscapine:**  Absorbed well orally. Metabolized in the liver.  Elimination pathway details are not precisely defined, but it is likely through both renal and hepatic routes.

- **Mode of Action:**
    - **Chlorpheniramine:**  Competitively inhibits the binding of histamine to H1 receptors.
    - **Noscapine:** Affects the cough center in the medulla oblongata, suppressing the cough reflex. The precise mechanism at the cellular level is not fully elucidated, but may involve sigma receptors. Does not bind to opiate receptors.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The standard dose is generally a combination of 2-4 mg of chlorpheniramine maleate with 15-30mg of noscapine, taken every 4-6 hours as needed. It's important to note that dosages can vary by brand and specific formulation.  Always consult the product's instructions.

#### **Children:**  Dosages should be determined by a pediatrician and are typically weight-based. For general guidance, one source suggests: 2.5 mL for a weight between 22-32 lbs, 4 mL for a weight between 33-43 lbs. However, this cannot replace specific pediatric guidance.  Safety is paramount. Avoid use in children under 2 years of age without explicit medical guidance. 

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses due to potential age-related decrease in renal and hepatic function. Close monitoring for adverse effects is recommended.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are often required. Consult a nephrologist for specific recommendations based on the level of impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dose reduction may be necessary. Consult a hepatologist.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised, especially for patients with cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, asthma, or prostatic hypertrophy.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Noscapine is typically not indicated for specialized clinical scenarios such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use.  Its usage is primarily limited to outpatient symptomatic relief of cough associated with upper respiratory tract infections. In emergency situations, other medications are generally preferred.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are often needed for patients with renal/hepatic impairment. Always refer to specific product information and consult specialist physicians as needed for optimal patient care.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth/nose/throat, blurred vision, constipation, nausea, and stomach upset.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, difficulty breathing), hallucinations, seizures, irregular heartbeats, difficulty urinating.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Limited data are available on long-term effects.  Chronic use is generally not recommended unless specifically advised by a physician.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Significant ADRs include severe allergic reactions, respiratory depression, and cardiac arrhythmias.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to either drug, severe liver or kidney disease, narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, acute asthma attacks, MAOI use.


## **Drug Interactions**

Alcohol, other sedatives (opioids, benzodiazepines), other antihistamines, MAOIs, warfarin.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Use only when clearly needed and under strict medical supervision. Discuss risks and benefits with the patient.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution.  Small, occasional doses are likely acceptable, but prolonged use or higher doses may cause infant drowsiness or reduce milk supply. Non-sedating antihistamines are often preferred during lactation.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Chlorpheniramine: H1 receptor antagonist; Noscapine: Centrally acting antitussive (non-opioid).
- **Side Effects:** Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe hepatic/renal impairment, MAOI use.
- **Drug Interactions:** Alcohol, sedatives, antihistamines, MAOIs, warfarin.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution. Consult physician.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 2-4 mg chlorpheniramine + 15-30 mg noscapine every 4-6 hours. Pediatric doses: Consult pediatrician.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Respiratory rate, blood pressure, signs of allergic reactions.


## **Popular Combinations**

While Chlorpheniramine + Noscapine is itself a combination, it is sometimes further combined with other agents such as decongestants or expectorants. However, such combinations are generally available as individual brand-name products and not as generic mixtures prescribed separately.


## **Precautions**

Pre-existing medical conditions, especially respiratory, hepatic, renal, and cardiovascular diseases should be carefully considered. Caution is advised in the elderly and children.  Driving or operating machinery may be impaired due to drowsiness.
