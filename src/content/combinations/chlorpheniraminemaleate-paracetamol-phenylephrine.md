## **Usage**

Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Paracetamol + Phenylephrine is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of common cold and flu symptoms, including fever, headache, body aches, nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.  It is also used to alleviate symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis and sinusitis.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This drug is a combination product containing:

* **Paracetamol:** Analgesic and antipyretic
* **Phenylephrine:** Nasal decongestant (sympathomimetic)
* **Chlorpheniramine:** Antihistamine

**Mechanism of Action:**  Paracetamol reduces fever and pain by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis in the central nervous system. Phenylephrine constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing congestion. Chlorpheniramine blocks the effects of histamine, relieving allergy symptoms like sneezing and runny nose.


## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication doesn't have a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN). It's often referred to by its constituent drugs. Some regional or descriptive names may exist.

**Brand Names:**  Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region. Examples include:

* COL-COL
* Sinarest Plus
* Restocin
* Cimegripe
* Resfenol
* Febrex Plus
* Panadol Sinus Pain & Congestion Relief


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Paracetamol:** Exerts its analgesic and antipyretic effects centrally, primarily by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis within the hypothalamus. The exact mechanism of analgesic action is not fully understood.
* **Phenylephrine:**  Acts as an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist, causing vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa, reducing swelling and congestion.
* **Chlorpheniramine:**  Competitively antagonizes histamine at H1 receptors, reducing the effects of histamine release, such as vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and smooth muscle contraction.


**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Paracetamol:** Readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  Metabolized primarily in the liver via glucuronidation and sulfation.  Excreted mainly in the urine.
* **Phenylephrine:** Absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but undergoes significant first-pass metabolism.  Metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the intestinal wall and liver.  Excreted in the urine.
* **Chlorpheniramine:** Well absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver. Primarily excreted in the urine, with some biliary excretion.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Paracetamol is eliminated predominantly through renal excretion of its metabolites.  Phenylephrine undergoes both hepatic and intestinal metabolism before renal excretion. Chlorpheniramine is eliminated primarily through hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.



## **Dosage**

Dosage recommendations vary depending on the specific formulation and the patient's age and condition. Consult the specific product information for precise dosing instructions.



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Typical dosages for adults might involve one or two tablets every four to six hours, not exceeding a specific maximum daily dose (e.g., six tablets).


#### **Children:** Dosage in children is typically weight-based or age-based and should be determined in consultation with a healthcare professional. Safety and efficacy in children below a certain age (e.g., under 6 or 12 years old) have not always been established for all formulations.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary due to age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Careful dose adjustment based on the degree of impairment is crucial.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction is usually required, as these medications are primarily metabolized by the liver.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, glaucoma, and other conditions.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination medication is typically not indicated for specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use.  Its use is generally limited to the symptomatic relief of common cold and allergy symptoms.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be needed for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, elderly individuals, and those with certain comorbidities. Specific product labeling should always be consulted for detailed instructions.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Blurred vision
* Constipation

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Liver damage (with paracetamol overdose)
* Hypertension (with phenylephrine)
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Seizures


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic use of high doses of paracetamol can lead to liver damage.  Long-term use of phenylephrine may cause rebound congestion.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** Serious ADRs require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**
