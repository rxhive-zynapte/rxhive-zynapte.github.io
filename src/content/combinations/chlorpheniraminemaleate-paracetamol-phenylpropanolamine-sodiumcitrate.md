## **Usage**

This combination medication is used for symptomatic relief of the common cold, flu, and allergies. It addresses symptoms such as fever, headache, body aches, nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This combination product falls into multiple pharmacological categories:

*   Analgesic and Antipyretic: Paracetamol
*   Decongestant: Phenylpropanolamine
*   Antihistamine: Chlorpheniramine
*   Expectorant/Mucolytic: Sodium Citrate

**Mechanism of Action:**

*   **Paracetamol:** Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, reducing pain and fever.
*   **Phenylpropanolamine:** Constricts blood vessels in the nasal mucosa, reducing swelling and congestion.
*   **Chlorpheniramine:** Blocks histamine H1 receptors, relieving allergic symptoms.
*   **Sodium Citrate:** Helps thin and loosen mucus.

## **Alternate Names**

*   Paracetamol-Phenylpropanolamine-Chlorpheniramine-Sodium Citrate combination (order of ingredients may vary)
*   Chlorpheniramine-Paracetamol-Phenylpropanolamine-Sodium Citrate combination

**Brand Names:**

*   Basecold

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

*   **Paracetamol:** Reduces fever by acting on the hypothalamic heat-regulating center and provides analgesia by increasing the pain threshold.
*   **Phenylpropanolamine:** Acts as a sympathomimetic amine, causing vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa.
*   **Chlorpheniramine:** Competes with histamine for H1-receptor sites on effector cells in the gastrointestinal tract, blood vessels, and respiratory tract.
*   **Sodium Citrate:** Increases bronchial secretions, making it easier to expectorate mucus.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Paracetamol:** Absorbed rapidly, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 30 to 60 minutes following oral administration. Hepatic metabolism.
*   **Phenylpropanolamine:** Readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, metabolised in the liver.
*   **Chlorpheniramine:** Well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, metabolised primarily in the liver.
*   **Sodium Citrate:** Absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and excreted via urine.

**Mode of Action:**

*   **Paracetamol:** Exact mechanism unclear. COX inhibition. Affects the hypothalamic heat-regulating center.
*   **Phenylpropanolamine:** Stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors, leading to vasoconstriction.
*   **Chlorpheniramine:** Inverse agonist activity at H1 receptors.
*   **Sodium Citrate:** Increases hydration of respiratory secretions.

**Elimination Pathways:**

*   **Paracetamol:** Primarily renal excretion.
*   **Phenylpropanolamine:** Renal excretion.
*   **Chlorpheniramine:** Hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.
*   **Sodium Citrate:** Renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One tablet every four to six hours as needed. Do not exceed five tablets in 24 hours.

#### **Children:**

Dosing is weight-dependent and typically recommended for children over 6 years of age. Consult a healthcare professional for accurate pediatric dosing.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose due to potential decreased renal and hepatic function.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dose reduction may be necessary.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consult a healthcare professional for guidance.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is typically not used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. It is primarily indicated for symptomatic relief of common cold and flu symptoms.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Consult a healthcare professional for dosage adjustments based on renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, constipation.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), difficulty breathing, hallucinations, seizures.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

With appropriate use as directed, this combination medication does not typically cause long-term adverse effects. However, chronic misuse or overuse of paracetamol can lead to liver damage. Phenylpropanolamine, particularly at high doses or with prolonged use, may lead to cardiovascular complications.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, hepatotoxicity (with paracetamol overdose), cardiovascular complications (with phenylpropanolamine overuse).

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any components, severe hypertension, severe coronary artery disease, concurrent use of MAO inhibitors, closed-angle glaucoma.

## **Drug Interactions**

Alcohol, other sedatives, MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, antihypertensives, other medications metabolized by the liver.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult a healthcare professional before using this medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Phenylpropanolamine use during pregnancy can increase the risk of premature birth.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
