## **Usage**

- This drug is prescribed for the temporary relief of common cold symptoms such as nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, itchy or watery eyes, and postnasal drip.  It may also be used for allergic rhinitis and sinusitis.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing a first-generation antihistamine (chlorpheniramine maleate) and a decongestant (phenylpropanolamine). It may also include an analgesic and antipyretic like paracetamol in some formulations.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Chlorpheniramine maleate competes with histamine for H1-receptor sites, reducing allergic symptoms.  Phenylpropanolamine acts as a sympathomimetic amine, constricting blood vessels in the nasal mucosa, which reduces swelling and congestion.

## **Alternate Names**

- While the generic name is Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Phenylpropanolamine, the specific name may vary depending on the addition of other active ingredients like paracetamol.
- **Brand Names:**  Many brand names exist depending on the region and specific formulation. Some examples include  (Note: Brand names are location-specific. Some brands mentioned in the source material are no longer available in many regions due to regulatory changes regarding phenylpropanolamine).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Chlorpheniramine reduces histamine-mediated responses like capillary permeability, vasodilation, and itching. Phenylpropanolamine, through its alpha-adrenergic agonist activity, constricts blood vessels in the nasal mucosa, reducing congestion. If paracetamol is included, it exerts analgesic and antipyretic effects through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Chlorpheniramine is well-absorbed orally. It's metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine. Phenylpropanolamine is also well-absorbed orally, metabolized by the liver, and excreted in the urine.
- **Mode of Action:** Chlorpheniramine acts as an inverse agonist at the H1 histamine receptor. Phenylpropanolamine acts as an alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Both drugs are primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- One tablet or 5-10 ml of syrup every 4-6 hours as needed. The maximum daily dose should not be exceeded as per the specific product formulation.

#### **Children:**
- Dosing varies with age and formulation. Consult the specific product information or a healthcare professional for pediatric dosing.  Use in children under 6 years old should be under the guidance of a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** Lower doses may be advisable due to potential age-related decline in organ function. Close monitoring for side effects is recommended.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are necessary based on the degree of impairment.  Consult a nephrologist for guidance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution and dose reduction are necessary in patients with liver disease.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, and other conditions. Dose adjustments may be needed.


### **Clinical Use Cases**
The combination of chlorpheniramine maleate and phenylpropanolamine is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU. Its primary use is for symptomatic relief of common cold and allergy symptoms in an outpatient setting.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
Adjustments are required for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and those with certain comorbid conditions (see Special Cases above). Always individualize therapy based on patient response and tolerance.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**
- Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, nausea, restlessness, and difficulty urinating.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), hallucinations, seizures, rapid or irregular heartbeat, difficulty breathing, and severe liver damage.


### **Long-Term Effects**
- Chronic use of phenylpropanolamine can potentially increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. This risk is low but has led to restrictions on its use in many countries.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
- Any severe allergic reactions or signs of liver damage (jaundice, abdominal pain, dark urine) warrant immediate medical attention.




## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to chlorpheniramine, phenylpropanolamine, or any other ingredients in the formulation.
- Monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) use within the past 14 days.
- Severe hypertension, coronary artery disease, or uncontrolled hyperthyroidism.
- Closed-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, and severe liver or kidney disease.



## **Drug Interactions**

- MAOIs, other antihistamines, antidepressants, sedatives, alcohol, and certain other medications can potentiate the sedative effects or other adverse reactions.
- Consult a drug interaction database for a complete list of potential interactions.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Limited data is available. Use only if clearly needed and under the advice of a physician. The potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks.
- **Breastfeeding:** This drug may pass into breast milk and can cause irritability and drowsiness in the infant.  Use with caution and only when the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  Non-sedating antihistamines are preferred alternatives.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Chlorpheniramine: H1 receptor inverse agonist; Phenylpropanolamine: Alpha-adrenergic agonist.
- **Side Effects:** Drowsiness, dry mouth, dizziness, blurred vision, constipation.  Rarely: allergic reactions, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, MAOI use, severe cardiovascular or thyroid disease, closed-angle glaucoma, severe liver or kidney disease.

## **Popular Combinations**
Phenylpropanolamine and chlorpheniramine are sometimes combined with other medications, such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) for added analgesic and antipyretic effects, or dextromethorphan for cough suppression. However, the availability of these combinations is subject to regional regulations.


## **Precautions**
- Pre-existing medical conditions (see Contraindications and Special Cases sections).
- Caution in elderly patients, pregnant/breastfeeding women, and children.
