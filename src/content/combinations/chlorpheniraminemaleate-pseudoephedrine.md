## **Usage**

Chlorpheniramine maleate + pseudoephedrine is prescribed for the temporary relief of symptoms associated with the common cold, hay fever, and other upper respiratory allergies. These symptoms include nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, itchy or watery eyes, and itching of the nose or throat.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This combination drug falls under two classifications:

* **Antihistamine (Chlorpheniramine):**  Reduces allergy symptoms by blocking the effects of histamine.
* **Decongestant (Pseudoephedrine):**  Relieves nasal congestion by constricting blood vessels in the nasal passages.


## **Alternate Names**

While a common international nonproprietary name (INN) isn't established, regional or descriptive names might exist. Brand names include Allerest Maximum Strength and Hay Fever, Sudafed Sinus and Allergy, and various generic formulations.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

Chlorpheniramine, a first-generation alkylamine H1-receptor antagonist, competes with histamine for receptor sites, thus reducing the effects of histamine release, which include vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and smooth muscle contraction.  Pseudoephedrine, a sympathomimetic amine, acts as an alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist, primarily in the respiratory tract. This leads to vasoconstriction, shrinking the swollen nasal mucous membranes and reducing nasal congestion.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

Both chlorpheniramine and pseudoephedrine are well-absorbed orally. Chlorpheniramine is metabolized in the liver via CYP450 enzymes, primarily CYP2D6, and eliminated renally. Pseudoephedrine is partially metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily unchanged in the urine.

**Mode of Action:**

* **Chlorpheniramine:** H1 receptor antagonism.
* **Pseudoephedrine:**  Alpha-adrenergic receptor agonism.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One tablet (chlorpheniramine maleate 4 mg + pseudoephedrine HCl 60 mg) every 4 to 6 hours. Maximum: 4 tablets per 24 hours. Liquid formulations have different concentrations and dosing instructions; always refer to the specific product labeling.

#### **Children:**

* **<6 years:** Consult a pediatrician.
* **6-12 years:** Liquid formulations are preferred.  Refer to specific product labeling for precise dosing according to age and formulation.
* **â‰¥12 years:** Refer to adult dosing.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and monitor for adverse effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, and prostatic hypertrophy.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU. Its primary use is for outpatient symptomatic relief of cold and allergy symptoms. For specific situations such as emergency situations or use within hospital settings, consult a clinical pharmacologist.
