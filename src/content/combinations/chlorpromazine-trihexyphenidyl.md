## **Usage**

This combination is prescribed for the management of psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, and for the treatment of drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which are movement disorders that can be a side effect of antipsychotic medications like chlorpromazine.

* **Pharmacological Classification:** Chlorpromazine is an antipsychotic (neuroleptic), while trihexyphenidyl is an anticholinergic and antiparkinsonian agent.

* **Mechanism of Action:** Chlorpromazine primarily works by blocking dopamine D2 receptors in the brain. Trihexyphenidyl, on the other hand, works by blocking acetylcholine receptors, helping to rebalance the dopamine-acetylcholine ratio disrupted by chlorpromazine and thereby mitigating EPS.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for the combination itself, other than perhaps "chlorpromazine-trihexyphenidyl."

* **Brand names:**  Trinicalm Forte

## **How It Works**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Chlorpromazine exerts its antipsychotic effects through dopamine D2 receptor antagonism. Trihexyphenidyl reduces EPS by its anticholinergic action.

* **Pharmacokinetics:** Chlorpromazine is well-absorbed orally but undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. It's metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP450 enzymes (CYP2D6). Trihexyphenidyl is also well-absorbed and metabolized in the liver. Both are primarily eliminated in urine.

* **Mode of Action:**  Chlorpromazine blocks dopamine D2 receptors, leading to reduced dopaminergic neurotransmission. Trihexyphenidyl acts as an antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, counteracting the cholinergic excess caused by dopamine blockade. Elimination is predominantly through hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Chlorpromazine: Starting dose is typically 25-50 mg three times daily, gradually increased to a target dose, often in the 300-800 mg/day range; in some cases higher doses may be needed, up to 1-2 grams per day. Trihexyphenidyl: 1-2 mg/day initially, increased as needed up to 15mg/day in divided doses.

#### **Children:** Not routinely recommended in children.

#### **Special Cases:** Dosages should be individualized and closely monitored. Reduced dosages are recommended in the elderly, patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, and those with certain comorbid conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosages are adjusted based on the patient's response and the specific clinical situation.

* **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, Emergency Situations:** Chlorpromazine may be used in these settings for its sedative and antiemetic properties, with dosages adjusted based on the situation. Trihexyphenidyl is generally not used in acute settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
Renal/hepatic impairment warrants dose reductions.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
* **Chlorpromazine:** Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), blurred vision, orthostatic hypotension.
* **Trihexyphenidyl:** Dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention, cognitive changes (especially in older patients).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
* **Chlorpromazine:** Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), tardive dyskinesia, agranulocytosis.
* **Trihexyphenidyl:** Angle-closure glaucoma, cardiac arrhythmias, paralytic ileus.

### **Long-Term Effects:**
* **Chlorpromazine:** Tardive dyskinesia, metabolic changes.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** NMS, agranulocytosis, severe EPS, and angle-closure glaucoma require immediate medical attention.

## **Contraindications**
* **Chlorpromazine:** Coma, severe CNS depression, hypersensitivity to phenothiazines.
* **Trihexyphenidyl:** Narrow-angle glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, prostatic hypertrophy, urinary tract obstruction.

## **Drug Interactions**
* Both drugs can interact with other medications that have anticholinergic properties, as well as with CNS depressants like alcohol and opioids. They can also affect the metabolism of other drugs by inhibiting or inducing CYP450 enzymes. Consult a drug interaction database for a complete list of potential interactions.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
* Chlorpromazine is generally avoided during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, due to potential risks to the fetus. 
* Trihexyphenidyl should also be used with caution during pregnancy.
* Both drugs can be excreted in breast milk and should be used cautiously during breastfeeding.

This combination is itself a popular combination where trihexyphenidyl is used to manage EPS induced by chlorpromazine.


## **Precautions**
Close monitoring is necessary, especially during initial therapy and dose adjustments. Pre-existing medical conditions, age, and other individual factors should be taken into consideration.
