## Usage

This combination of Chlorpropamide and Phenformin was previously used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, but it is no longer recommended due to the risk of serious side effects, particularly lactic acidosis associated with Phenformin.  Phenformin has been withdrawn from many markets worldwide.  Therefore, discussing this combination in detail for current clinical practice is not applicable.  It's crucial for Indian doctors to be aware of the outdated nature of this combination.  Metformin, a safer biguanide, is now preferred in combination with other antidiabetic agents.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Chlorpropamide: Sulfonylurea (first-generation)
* Phenformin: Biguanide


**Mechanism of Action (historical):**

* Chlorpropamide: Stimulates insulin release from the pancreas.
* Phenformin: Decreases hepatic glucose production, increases insulin sensitivity, and may improve glucose uptake in peripheral tissues.

## Alternate Names

This specific combination doesn't have alternate names. The individual drugs do:

* **Chlorpropamide:**  Diabinese (brand name)
* **Phenformin:**  DBI, Meltrol (brand names â€“ discontinued)



## How It Works (historical)

**Chlorpropamide:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:**  Binds to sulfonylurea receptors on pancreatic beta-cells, leading to closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels, depolarization of the cell membrane, and calcium influx.  This triggers insulin release.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Orally administered, well-absorbed. Metabolized in the liver (CYP2C9), excreted primarily in the urine. Long half-life (approximately 36 hours).

**Phenformin:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Inhibits mitochondrial complex I, affecting gluconeogenesis and potentially enhancing peripheral glucose utilization. The exact mechanism remains partially unclear.
* **Pharmacokinetics:**  Orally administered, well-absorbed. Not metabolized significantly, excreted primarily by the kidneys.


## Dosage

This combination is **no longer recommended** due to the risk of lactic acidosis associated with Phenformin.  **No current dosage guidelines exist.**  Information provided here is purely for historical context.

**Historical Dosage (Chlorpropamide):**

* **Adults:** Initially 250 mg daily, adjusted as needed based on blood glucose; maximum 750 mg daily.
* **Children:**  Not recommended.

**Historical Dosage (Phenformin):**

* **Adults:**  50-150 mg daily, divided into two or three doses.


## Side Effects

**Chlorpropamide:** Hypoglycemia, gastrointestinal upset, skin reactions, hyponatremia (due to SIADH).

**Phenformin:** Lactic acidosis (rare but serious), gastrointestinal effects (metallic taste, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), anorexia, vitamin B12 deficiency.

## Contraindications

**Chlorpropamide:** Type 1 diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis, severe renal or hepatic impairment, sulfonamide allergy.

**Phenformin:**  Renal impairment, hepatic disease, heart failure, history of lactic acidosis, conditions predisposing to tissue hypoxia.


## Drug Interactions

Both drugs have numerous potential drug interactions, including with alcohol, other antidiabetic medications, and certain antibiotics. Consult historical references for a complete list.



## Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

**Chlorpropamide:**  Contraindicated in pregnancy.

**Phenformin:**  Contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding.
