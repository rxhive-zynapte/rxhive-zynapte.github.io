## **Usage**

- This combination drug is prescribed for the treatment of essential hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults. It is particularly beneficial for patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by dual-drug therapy.  It may also be used in the management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with hypertension.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antihypertensive (comprising an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), a calcium channel blocker (CCB), and a thiazide-like diuretic).
- **Mechanism of Action:** This triple-combination therapy targets multiple pathways involved in blood pressure regulation. Olmesartan blocks angiotensin II receptors, leading to vasodilation. Cilnidipine inhibits calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle cells, further promoting vasodilation. Chlorthalidone increases the excretion of sodium and water, reducing blood volume.


## **Alternate Names**

While there isn't an official international nonproprietary name for this specific combination, it's often described by its constituent drugs. Some regional variations may exist.
- **Brand Names:** Several brand names are available including Olmevac Trio, Olmistrum Trio, Olkem Trio, Nulong Trio, Olnyd Trio, Olsong Trio, Olvan Trio, Olmin Trio, Trinexovas.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Olmesartan medoxomil, a prodrug, is rapidly hydrolyzed to olmesartan during absorption. Olmesartan selectively blocks the binding of angiotensin II to the type 1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) subtype, reducing blood pressure by inhibiting vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion. Cilnidipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes, promoting vasodilation. Chlorthalidone inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule, leading to increased excretion of sodium and water, thus decreasing blood volume and lowering blood pressure.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Olmesartan medoxomil is orally administered. Cilnidipine is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations in approximately 1 to 4 hours. Chlorthalidone is also well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations in approximately 3-6 hours. The elimination half-lives of these agents are approximately 13 hours for olmesartan, 6-12 hours for cilnidipine and 30-60 hours for chlorthalidone.
- **Mode of Action (Cellular/Molecular):** Olmesartan acts by blocking the AT1 receptor. Cilnidipine blocks L-type and N-type calcium channels. Chlorthalidone inhibits the sodium-chloride symporter in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Olmesartan binds to and blocks the AT1 receptor. Cilnidipine blocks calcium channels.  Chlorthalidone inhibits the sodium-chloride symporter.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Olmesartan is primarily eliminated through biliary excretion with some renal elimination; Cilnidipine is primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism; Chlorthalidone is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The standard dose is one tablet containing Olmesartan 40mg, Cilnidipine 10mg, and Chlorthalidone 12.5mg taken orally once daily, preferably in the morning with or without food.

#### **Children:**

- The safety and effectiveness of this combination have not been established in the pediatric population. It is not recommended for use in children below 12 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and monitor closely for hypotension (low blood pressure). More frequent blood pressure monitoring is recommended.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  For mild to moderate impairment, the maximum recommended olmesartan dose is 20mg. In patients with moderate renal impairment, monitoring serum potassium and creatinine levels is advised. This combination is contraindicated in severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min).
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction. Dose adjustment may be required.  The combination is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with heart failure, diabetes, gout, hyperlipidemia, and electrolyte imbalances. Monitor serum electrolytes, uric acid, and blood glucose as needed.
