## **Usage**

Chlorthalidone + Losartan is prescribed for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure).  It is a combination drug containing a thiazide diuretic (chlorthalidone) and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) (losartan). This combination is particularly useful in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by monotherapy with either drug alone.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antihypertensive (combination of a thiazide diuretic and an angiotensin II receptor blocker)
- **Mechanism of Action:** Chlorthalidone decreases blood volume by increasing the excretion of sodium and water. Losartan blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that constricts blood vessels.  The combined effect lowers blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no single international nonproprietary name (INN) for this combination product.  It is typically referred to by the generic names of its components: chlorthalidone and losartan.

- **Brand Names:** Several brand names may exist depending on the region and manufacturer.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Chlorthalidone inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron, leading to increased excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Losartan blocks the binding of angiotensin II to its receptor, preventing vasoconstriction and promoting vasodilation. The combined effect lowers peripheral resistance and reduces blood volume, thereby reducing blood pressure.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
- **Chlorthalidone:** Well absorbed orally, with a relatively long half-life (around 40-60 hours). Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.
- **Losartan:**  Orally absorbed and metabolized in the liver to an active metabolite, EXP3174, which has a longer half-life (6-9 hours) than losartan (around 2 hours). Both losartan and EXP3174 are eliminated via biliary and urinary routes.


**Mode of Action:**
- **Chlorthalidone:** Acts on the sodium-chloride symporter in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney.
- **Losartan:**  Selectively blocks the AT1 receptor subtype for angiotensin II.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Losartan acts via receptor blockade (AT1 receptor). Chlorthalidone's diuretic action stems from inhibiting the sodium-chloride symporter.


**Elimination Pathways:**  Chlorthalidone is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Losartan is metabolized in the liver and excreted through both biliary and urinary pathways.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose:  Losartan 25-50 mg and Chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg once daily.
- Titration: Dosage can be increased by the physician as needed up to Losartan 100 mg and Chlorthalidone 25 mg once daily.

#### **Children:**

This combination is not recommended for use in children.  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.



#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Lower starting doses may be appropriate due to age-related decline in renal function. Close monitoring is essential.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary based on the degree of renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Losartan dosage should be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring is necessary for patients with diabetes, heart failure, or other comorbidities.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of Chlorthalidone and Losartan is specifically indicated for the management of hypertension. It's not typically used in the context of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) use, or emergency situations.  For such cases, other antihypertensive agents with more rapid onset and shorter duration of action may be preferred.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on patient response, renal function, hepatic function, and concomitant medications.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Dizziness, lightheadedness, hypotension, fatigue, electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hyponatremia), cough, and upper respiratory tract infections.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Angioedema (swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat), severe hypotension, acute renal failure, hepatotoxicity, and syncope.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Electrolyte imbalances, renal impairment, and gout.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any of the above side effects, if severe, could be considered an ADR.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to chlorthalidone, losartan, or other sulfonamide-derived drugs.
- Anuria (absence of urine formation).
- Pregnancy (especially second and third trimesters).
- Concomitant use with aliskiren in patients with diabetes.



## **Drug Interactions**

- Other antihypertensives (additive hypotensive effects).
- Potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics (risk of hyperkalemia).
- NSAIDs (may reduce antihypertensive effect and increase risk of renal impairment).
- Lithium (increased lithium levels).
- Grapefruit juice (may increase losartan concentrations).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Contraindicated, especially in the second and third trimesters, due to the risk of fetal harm.
- **Breastfeeding:** Chlorthalidone is excreted in breast milk.  Losartan's presence in breast milk is uncertain.  The combination is generally not recommended during breastfeeding.




## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Chlorthalidone: Thiazide diuretic; Losartan: Angiotensin II receptor blocker.
- **Side Effects:** Dizziness, hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, cough.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, anuria, pregnancy.
- **Drug Interactions:** Other antihypertensives, potassium supplements, NSAIDs, lithium.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy; not recommended during breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:**  Adult initial: Losartan 25-50mg/ Chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg daily;  Maximum: Losartan 100mg/ Chlorthalidone 25 mg daily.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, potassium levels, renal function.



## **Popular Combinations**

Chlorthalidone and losartan are frequently prescribed together due to their synergistic antihypertensive effects.  Combining them allows for lower doses of each component, potentially minimizing side effects while maximizing efficacy.



## **Precautions**

- Monitor blood pressure, potassium levels, and renal function.
- Caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, diabetes, and heart failure.
- Avoid potassium supplements and potassium-rich foods unless specifically instructed by a physician.
