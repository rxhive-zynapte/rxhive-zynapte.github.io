## **Usage**

- This triple combination medication is prescribed for the treatment of essential hypertension, especially in patients with stable coronary artery disease who haven't achieved adequate blood pressure control with dual therapy.
- **Pharmacological Classification**: Antihypertensive (combining a thiazide-like diuretic, a beta-blocker, and an angiotensin II receptor blocker).
- **Mechanism of Action**:  This combination targets multiple pathways involved in blood pressure regulation. Chlorthalidone reduces blood volume by increasing sodium and water excretion. Metoprolol succinate lowers heart rate and cardiac output by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors. Telmisartan blocks angiotensin II receptors, leading to vasodilation and reduced aldosterone secretion.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination.
- **Brand Names**: Telma MCT (Glenmark Pharmaceuticals), Metocard-CHT (Torrent Pharmaceuticals) and other generic versions exist.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**:  Chlorthalidone reduces blood volume through diuresis. Metoprolol decreases heart rate, contractility, and cardiac output. Telmisartan causes vasodilation and reduces peripheral vascular resistance. The combined effect lowers blood pressure.
- **Pharmacokinetics**: All three drugs are orally absorbed. Chlorthalidone is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Metoprolol is extensively metabolized in the liver, mainly by CYP2D6. Telmisartan is primarily excreted in the bile as unchanged drug.
- **Mode of Action**: Chlorthalidone inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron. Metoprolol competitively blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors. Telmisartan selectively blocks angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptors.
- **Elimination Pathways**: Chlorthalidone is primarily eliminated via renal excretion. Metoprolol is metabolized by hepatic CYP2D6 enzymes, with renal excretion of metabolites. Telmisartan is mainly eliminated through biliary excretion of unchanged drug.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- Initial dose: One tablet of Chlorthalidone 12.5mg + Metoprolol Succinate 25mg (or 50mg) + Telmisartan 40mg once daily.
- The dose can be increased after 2-4 weeks if blood pressure is not controlled, up to a maximum of two tablets daily as per the physician's discretion.

#### **Children:**
- Not recommended for children under 18, as safety and effectiveness have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients**: Start with the lowest dose and titrate cautiously.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Dose adjustment may be necessary depending on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**:  Start with the lowest dose and monitor closely, as hepatic impairment may affect metoprolol metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Close monitoring is required in patients with asthma, diabetes, gout, lupus, or thyroid disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases**
- This specific combination is not typically used in clinical scenarios such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary indication is for the long-term management of hypertension in stable coronary artery disease patients.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
- Dose modifications are needed in renal or hepatic impairment, and for patients with other comorbidities as described above.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
- Dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, fatigue, weakness, diarrhea, nausea, low blood pressure, increased urination, electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hyponatremia).


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Severe hypotension, bradycardia, heart block, angioedema, worsening heart failure, liver dysfunction.


### **Long-Term Effects**

## **Drug Interactions**

- Potassium supplements, NSAIDs, CYP2D6 enzyme inducers (rifampin, dexamethasone), other antihypertensives, digoxin, insulin or oral antidiabetic agents, antidepressants (fluoxetine, paroxetine).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category**:  Contraindicated in the second and third trimesters.  Use with caution during the first trimester, considering risks and benefits.
- Fetal risks include impaired renal function and growth retardation.
- **Breastfeeding**: Consult a doctor before taking this medication while breastfeeding.

- **Dosage:** See above.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, heart rate, electrolytes (especially potassium and sodium), renal function, liver function.


## **Popular Combinations**
- While this is already a triple combination, in some cases other antihypertensives or medications for comorbidities might be added based on patient needs and response.



## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions**: Screen patients for allergies, metabolic disorders, and organ dysfunction before initiating therapy.  
- **Specific Populations**: See above sections on Elderly Patients, Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment, Patients with Comorbid Conditions, and Pregnancy and Breastfeeding.
