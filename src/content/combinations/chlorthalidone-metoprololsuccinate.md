## **Usage**

- Chlorthalidone + Metoprolol Succinate is prescribed for the management of **hypertension** (high blood pressure). It may also be used to manage **edema** (fluid retention) associated with heart failure, liver disease, or kidney disorders.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination drug includes a **thiazide-like diuretic** (chlorthalidone) and a **beta-blocker** (metoprolol succinate).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Chlorthalidone increases the elimination of sodium and water by the kidneys, reducing blood volume and lowering blood pressure. Metoprolol blocks the effects of epinephrine, decreasing heart rate and cardiac output, thus lowering blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

- While there are no official alternate names for the combination itself, the individual drugs are sometimes known by other names:
    - Chlorthalidone:  It is considered a thiazide-like diuretic.
    - Metoprolol: It has two salts – tartrate (immediate-release) and succinate (extended-release).
- **Brand Names:** Lopressidone®, Dutoprol® (containing hydrochlorothiazide, not chlorthalidone).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Chlorthalidone reduces blood volume by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidneys. Metoprolol blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors, leading to decreased heart rate, cardiac contractility, and renin release.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - Chlorthalidone: Absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, it is primarily eliminated unchanged by the kidneys.
    - Metoprolol Succinate:  Designed for extended-release, with once-daily dosing. Metabolized by the liver, with a smaller portion excreted unchanged by the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:** Chlorthalidone inhibits the sodium-chloride symporter in the distal convoluted tubule. Metoprolol antagonizes beta-1 adrenergic receptors. 
- **Elimination Pathways:** Chlorthalidone is primarily excreted renally. Metoprolol succinate is extensively metabolized by the liver, with some renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The starting dose of this combination drug can range from Metoprolol Succinate 25 mg / Chlorthalidone 6.25 mg to Metoprolol Succinate 100 mg / Chlorthalidone 25 mg administered orally, once daily.  Dosages may be adjusted at weekly or longer intervals up to a maximum of Metoprolol Succinate 400 mg per day and Chlorthalidone 25 mg per day.

#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy haven't been firmly established in children under 6 years old. For children 6 years and older, the initial dose of Metoprolol Succinate is 1 mg/kg once daily (not exceeding 50 mg), adjusted according to blood pressure response.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Begin with lower doses and adjust carefully due to potential age-related decline in organ function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Lower initial doses might be necessary depending on creatinine clearance; however, no specific dosing adjustments are universally recommended.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Initiate therapy at low doses and monitor closely due to the extensive hepatic metabolism of Metoprolol.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution advised in patients with diabetes (monitor blood glucose), asthma or COPD (metoprolol can exacerbate bronchospasm).


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of Chlorthalidone + Metoprolol Succinate is not typically employed in emergency or acute care settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use. Its primary role is in the chronic management of hypertension.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments should be made based on blood pressure response and individual patient tolerance. In cases of symptomatic bradycardia, the metoprolol dose should be reduced. For transient worsening of heart failure, increasing diuretics or temporarily discontinuing metoprolol might be considered.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, headache, nausea, upset stomach, diarrhea, constipation, cold hands and feet, sexual dysfunction.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, heart failure exacerbation, electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hyponatremia).

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Potential for worsening of glucose control in diabetic patients, masking symptoms of hypoglycemia.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe hypotension, bradycardia, heart block, bronchospasm.


## **Contraindications**

- Cardiogenic shock, severe bradycardia, second or third-degree heart block, severe peripheral arterial circulatory disorders, hypersensitivity to sulfa drugs (chlorthalidone), untreated pheochromocytoma, decompensated heart failure, severe liver disease.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Other antihypertensives (additive effects), digoxin (increased risk of bradycardia), NSAIDs (reduced antihypertensive effect), insulin or oral antidiabetic agents (altered glucose control), CYP2D6 inhibitors (increased metoprolol levels), alcohol (increased dizziness).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Metoprolol is classified as Pregnancy Category C. Chlorthalidone can cause fetal harm. This combination should be avoided during pregnancy unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.
- Metoprolol is excreted in breast milk.  Consult with a physician about risks vs benefits of taking the medication while breastfeeding. Consider whether alternative safer options for hypertension management are available.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Diuretic and beta-blocker combination reducing blood volume and cardiac output.
- **Side Effects:** Dizziness, lightheadedness, bradycardia, hypotension, fatigue, nausea.
- **Contraindications:**  Heart block, bradycardia, heart failure, severe peripheral artery disease.
- **Drug Interactions:**  Other antihypertensives, digoxin, NSAIDs, insulin/oral antidiabetics.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult with a physician before using if pregnant or breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** 25-100 mg metoprolol succinate and 6.25-25 mg chlorthalidone once daily, adjustable.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, heart rate, electrolytes (potassium, sodium), blood glucose (in diabetics).


## **Popular Combinations**

- While Chlorthalidone and Metoprolol Succinate is itself a popular combination, it can sometimes be used along with a third antihypertensive agent like Telmisartan if additional blood pressure control is needed.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Monitor renal function, electrolytes, and blood glucose in at-risk patients.
- **Specific Populations:** As mentioned above, special caution is necessary in pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, children, and the elderly.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Encourage lifestyle modifications such as dietary changes (sodium restriction), regular exercise, and stress management. Advise patients to avoid alcohol. Driving may be impaired by dizziness.
