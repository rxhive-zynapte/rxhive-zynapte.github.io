## **Usage**

Chlorthalidone + Nebivolol is prescribed for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure).  This combination is particularly useful when a single medication is not effective in controlling blood pressure.  It belongs to the pharmacological class of antihypertensives, specifically a combination of a thiazide-like diuretic (chlorthalidone) and a beta-blocker (nebivolol).

Chlorthalidone lowers blood pressure by increasing the excretion of sodium and water from the body.  Nebivolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker, meaning it primarily affects beta-1 receptors in the heart, leading to a decrease in heart rate and cardiac output, thereby lowering blood pressure. The combined effect results in more comprehensive blood pressure control.


## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate generic names for this combination. However, the individual components, chlorthalidone and nebivolol, may be known by other names in different regions.  Nebivolol is sometimes referred to as *d-nebivolol* to emphasize its specific isomeric form. One example of a brand name for the combination is StayHappi. Nebivolol is marketed under the brand name Bystolic. Chlorthalidone brand names include Hygroton and Thalitone.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Chlorthalidone acts on the distal convoluted tubule in the kidney, inhibiting sodium reabsorption, resulting in increased sodium and water excretion.  This diuresis reduces blood volume and lowers blood pressure. Nebivolol reduces heart rate and myocardial contractility by selectively blocking beta-1 adrenergic receptors. It also has vasodilating properties mediated by nitric oxide release, which further contributes to lowering blood pressure.


**Pharmacokinetics:** Chlorthalidone is well-absorbed orally, with peak plasma concentrations reached in 2-4 hours. It has a long half-life of 40-60 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing.  Nebivolol is also well-absorbed orally, reaching peak concentrations in 1-2 hours. It undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, primarily by CYP2D6, with a half-life of 10-12 hours.  Both drugs are primarily eliminated through renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The usual starting dose of Chlorthalidone + Nebivolol is Nebivolol 5 mg + Chlorthalidone 12.5 mg once daily, preferably in the morning. The dosage may be adjusted based on the patient's blood pressure response, with the maximum dose of nebivolol being 10 mg and chlorthalidone being 25 mg in the combination.


#### **Children:**

This combination is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age, as its safety and efficacy have not been established in this population.



#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose, such as Nebivolol 2.5 mg + Chlorthalidone 12.5 mg once daily, and titrate slowly as needed. Closely monitor for hypotension and bradycardia.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** For severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), the initial dose of Nebivolol should be reduced to 2.5 mg once daily, and Chlorthalidone dose should be adjusted based on renal function.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  For moderate hepatic impairment, the initial dose of Nebivolol should be reduced to 2.5 mg once daily. Chlorthalidone should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic dysfunction. 
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with diabetes, asthma, or peripheral vascular disease. Careful monitoring of blood glucose, pulmonary function, and peripheral circulation is essential.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of Chlorthalidone + Nebivolol is specifically indicated for the management of essential hypertension. It's not typically used in acute clinical scenarios such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. In these cases, other antihypertensive agents with more rapid onset and titratability are preferred.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient factors, including renal or hepatic dysfunction, age, and other comorbid conditions.  Close monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and electrolyte levels is important, particularly when initiating therapy or adjusting doses.

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Headache, dizziness, fatigue, bradycardia, nausea, diarrhea, and peripheral edema.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe hypotension, bronchospasm, heart block, and symptomatic bradycardia.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia), hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.

## **Contraindications**

* Bronchial asthma or a history of bronchospasm.
* Second- or third-degree atrioventricular block.
* Severe bradycardia.

## **Drug Interactions**

* Other antihypertensive medications: Additive hypotensive effects.

* Digoxin:  May enhance bradycardic effects of nebivolol.
* Insulin and oral hypoglycemics: May mask symptoms of hypoglycemia.
* Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): May reduce the antihypertensive effect of nebivolol and chlorthalidone.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Chlorthalidone + Nebivolol is generally not recommended during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester, as it may adversely affect fetal development.  It's also not recommended during breastfeeding. Consult a physician for alternative options during pregnancy and lactation.

## **Drug Profile Summary**
