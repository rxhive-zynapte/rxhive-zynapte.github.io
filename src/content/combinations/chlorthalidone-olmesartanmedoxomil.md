      How does this medication work to lower blood pressure?**


      **A:** Olmesartan blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that

      and water, reducing blood volume.  This combined action lowers blood
      pressure.

## **Usage**

- Chlorthalidone + Olmesartan Medoxomil is primarily indicated for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults. It is frequently prescribed when monotherapy (treatment with a single drug) is insufficient to control blood pressure.  This combination may also be used to manage fluid retention related to various conditions such as heart failure or liver/kidney disease.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antihypertensive (a combination of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and a thiazide-like diuretic).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Olmesartan Medoxomil blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels). This blockade leads to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), reducing blood pressure. Chlorthalidone increases the excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys, reducing blood volume and further lowering blood pressure.  The combined action of these two medications provides a synergistic effect in controlling hypertension.

## **Alternate Names**

- While "Chlorthalidone + Olmesartan Medoxomil" represents the generic name, the combination is marketed under various brand names, including Olmetor CH, Olmat CT, Olzox CH, Olmezest CH, and CTD-O, among others. These brand names may vary by region or country.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Olmesartan Medoxomil exerts its antihypertensive effect by blocking the binding of angiotensin II to its receptors, primarily the AT1 receptor. This action inhibits the vasoconstricting and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II, resulting in vasodilation and reduced sodium and water retention. Chlorthalidone inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron, promoting the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Olmesartan Medoxomil is a prodrug that's rapidly hydrolyzed during absorption to its active metabolite, olmesartan. Olmesartan has high oral bioavailability. Peak plasma concentrations are generally reached within 1-2 hours. Chlorthalidone is well-absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma levels occurring within 2-6 hours.
- **Mode of Action:**  Olmesartan acts as a competitive antagonist at the AT1 receptor, preventing angiotensin II from binding and exerting its vasoconstrictor effects.  Chlorthalidone primarily acts on the sodium-chloride symporter in the distal convoluted tubule, inhibiting sodium reabsorption.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Olmesartan is eliminated primarily through biliary and renal excretion. Chlorthalidone is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The initial dose is typically Olmesartan Medoxomil 20 mg + Chlorthalidone 12.5 mg once daily.
- If the blood pressure is not adequately controlled, the dose can be increased to Olmesartan Medoxomil 40 mg + Chlorthalidone 12.5 mg once daily or, in some instances, further titrated to Olmesartan Medoxomil 40 mg + Chlorthalidone 25 mg once daily.
- The maximum recommended dose is generally Olmesartan Medoxomil 40 mg + Chlorthalidone 25 mg per day.

#### **Children:**

- The safety and effectiveness of this fixed-dose combination have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 6 years. In children six years of age and older olmesartan medoxomil is available and dosing is based on the body weight.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary in elderly patients based on renal function and overall health status.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Careful dose titration is recommended in patients with renal impairment. Patients with severe renal dysfunction should generally avoid using this combination.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  Patients with severe hepatic dysfunction should avoid use.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring and dosage adjustments may be necessary in patients with comorbid conditions such as diabetes, heart failure, or other cardiovascular diseases.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- The use of this specific combination is not typically indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Dosage recommendations for these situations are irrelevant in the context of Chlorthalidone + Olmesartan Medoxomil therapy. It's important to remember that this medication primarily targets long-term blood pressure management and not acute scenarios.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments may be required based on individual patient characteristics, including renal function, hepatic function, age, other medications being taken, and response to therapy.
