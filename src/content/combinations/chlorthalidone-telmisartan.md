## **Usage**

Chlorthalidone + Telmisartan is primarily prescribed for the treatment of **hypertension** (high blood pressure).  It is particularly beneficial for patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by lifestyle modifications or monotherapy. It may also be used in the management of heart failure and kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes.

It's **pharmacological classification** is **antihypertensive**. This combination includes a thiazide diuretic (chlorthalidone) and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) (telmisartan).

This combination medication works by widening blood vessels and increasing urine output, thereby lowering blood pressure. Telmisartan blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that constricts blood vessels, which leads to vasodilation. Chlorthalidone helps the kidneys remove excess salt and water from the body, reducing blood volume and further lowering blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no officially recognized alternate names for the combination itself. However, it comprises two distinct generic drugs: chlorthalidone and telmisartan. These generic names are internationally recognized. Numerous brand names exist under which this fixed-dose combination is marketed.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Telmisartan blocks the angiotensin II receptor subtype 1 (AT1), inhibiting the vasoconstricting and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II.  Chlorthalidone inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron, promoting increased excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. This diuresis leads to decreased blood volume and lowers blood pressure.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Telmisartan is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentration in 0.5-1.5 hours. It has a high protein binding capacity and is metabolized primarily via conjugation. Telmisartan is excreted mainly in the feces. Chlorthalidone is also absorbed orally, with peak plasma concentration in 2-4 hours. It is highly protein-bound and has a long half-life, permitting once-daily dosing. Chlorthalidone is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys.


**Mechanism of Action:** Telmisartan acts by blocking AT1 receptors, leading to vasodilation and decreased aldosterone secretion. Chlorthalidone inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule, increasing urine output and lowering blood volume.

**Elimination Pathways:** Telmisartan is eliminated mainly through biliary excretion, with a small amount excreted in urine. Chlorthalidone is excreted primarily unchanged in the urine.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The starting dose is typically 40 mg telmisartan / 12.5 mg chlorthalidone once daily. Depending on the patient's response, the dose may be increased to 80 mg telmisartan / 12.5 mg chlorthalidone or 80mg telmisartan / 25mg chlorthalidone.

#### **Children:**

This combination is not recommended for children under 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal function and overall health. Start with a lower dose and titrate upwards cautiously.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction or avoidance may be required in patients with severe renal dysfunction. Careful monitoring of renal function is crucial.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, and dose adjustment may be needed in patients with hepatic impairment. Close monitoring is necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** In patients with diabetes, concurrent use with aliskiren (another antihypertensive) should be avoided. Closely monitor electrolytes, particularly potassium levels, in patients with heart failure.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The specific medical settings mentioned (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations) do not have unique dosage recommendations for this combination.  Dose adjustments should be made based on individual patient characteristics and clinical status in these settings.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary based on patient-specific factors like renal/hepatic dysfunction, other comorbid conditions, and concurrent medications.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infections, back pain, diarrhea, and low blood pressure.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (angioedema, rash, itching), syncope, hyperkalemia, acute renal failure, and liver dysfunction.  Rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown) is a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia), gout, and new-onset or worsening of diabetes.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis are rare but serious ADRs requiring immediate medical attention.



## **Contraindications**

Absolute contraindications include hypersensitivity to telmisartan or chlorthalidone, pregnancy (especially second and third trimesters), and anuria. Relative contraindications include severe renal impairment, hepatic impairment, bilateral renal artery stenosis, volume depletion, and electrolyte imbalances.

## **Drug Interactions**

Clinically significant drug interactions can occur with other antihypertensives (additive hypotensive effects), NSAIDs (reduced antihypertensive effect and increased risk of renal impairment), lithium (increased lithium levels), digoxin (increased digoxin levels), and potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics (risk of hyperkalemia).  Alcohol can potentiate the hypotensive effects of this combination. Consumption of high-potassium foods should be monitored.  CYP450 interactions are not a major concern with this drug combination.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Chlorthalidone + Telmisartan is contraindicated in pregnancy due to the risk of fetal harm, especially in the second and third trimesters.  It is not recommended during breastfeeding due to potential excretion in breast milk.  Safer alternative antihypertensives should be considered for pregnant or breastfeeding women.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and thiazide diuretic.
- **Side Effects:** Dizziness, headache, fatigue, hypotension, electrolyte imbalances.
- **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, anuria, hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:** NSAIDs, lithium, digoxin, potassium supplements.

## **Popular Combinations**

Chlorthalidone + Telmisartan is itself a popular combination. Sometimes other antihypertensives like amlodipine may be added for triple therapy in difficult-to-control hypertension.

## **Precautions**

Monitor blood pressure, electrolytes, and renal function regularly.  Caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Advise patients to avoid potassium supplements unless prescribed. Educate on signs and symptoms of hypotension and electrolyte imbalances.  Avoid alcohol.  Use with caution when operating machinery or driving.
