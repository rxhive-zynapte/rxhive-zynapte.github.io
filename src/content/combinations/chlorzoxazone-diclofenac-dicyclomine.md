## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily used for the relief of muscle spasms and pain associated with musculoskeletal conditions.  It combines the actions of three different drug classes:

* **Diclofenac:** Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
* **Chlorzoxazone:** Centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant
* **Dicyclomine:** Anticholinergic/antispasmodic drug

Its pharmacological classifications are: analgesic, muscle relaxant, antispasmodic, and anti-inflammatory.

The mechanism of action involves inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes (reducing prostaglandin synthesis and thereby diminishing inflammation and pain), acting on the central nervous system (CNS) to depress reflexes that cause muscle spasms, and inhibiting the action of acetylcholine, which stimulates smooth muscle contractions.

## **Alternate Names**

This specific drug combination is not a standard, globally recognized formulation and may be known by different names depending on the manufacturer.  It does not have an International Nonproprietary Name (INN). Brand names may vary regionally.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Diclofenac:** Reduces inflammation and pain by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, thus decreasing prostaglandin synthesis.
* **Chlorzoxazone:** Depresses reflexes in the CNS that cause muscle spasms.  The exact mechanism is not fully understood but is thought to involve action at the spinal cord and subcortical areas of the brain.
* **Dicyclomine:** Relaxes smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal tract by inhibiting the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Diclofenac:**  Well-absorbed orally.  Metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP2C9. Excreted via the kidneys.
* **Chlorzoxazone:**  Rapidly absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver, primarily via glucuronidation.  Excreted in urine, primarily as the glucuronide conjugate.
* **Dicyclomine:** Well-absorbed orally and parenterally.  Metabolized in the liver.  Excretion pathways are not fully characterized.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**

* **Diclofenac:** Inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.
* **Chlorzoxazone:**  Acts centrally, possibly at the spinal cord and subcortical levels, though the precise mechanism is not fully elucidated.
* **Dicyclomine:** Antagonist at muscarinic M1, M2, and M3 receptors.

**Elimination Pathways:**

* **Diclofenac:** Renal excretion.
* **Chlorzoxazone:**  Hepatic metabolism (glucuronidation) and renal excretion.
* **Dicyclomine:**  Hepatic metabolism with subsequent excretion; precise routes not fully characterized.


## **Dosage**

Because this specific combination is not a standard formulation, dosages are determined and adjusted according to individual patient needs and responses. The information below discusses each component's general dosing guidelines. It's crucial to refer to the prescribing physician's instructions for this combination product.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Dosages must be individualized based on patient needs and response. Individual component dosing guidelines are as follows: Diclofenac (25mg to 150mg daily, divided); Chlorzoxazone (250mg to 750mg daily, divided); and Dicyclomine (10mg to 20mg multiple times daily, or up to 80mg daily in divided doses for irritable bowel syndrome).


#### **Children:**

Use in children is generally avoided unless specifically directed by a physician. Safety and efficacy in children have not been well established.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments are often necessary due to age-related decline in renal and hepatic function. Lower starting doses and slower titration are recommended.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Diclofenac and Chlorzoxazone should be used with caution, and dose adjustments may be required. Dicyclomine dosage should be adjusted as well.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Diclofenac and Chlorzoxazone are metabolized in the liver, so dose reductions are typically necessary.  Dicyclomine adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration and dose adjustments may be required based on the specific comorbidity (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes).

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is not typically used in the clinical settings listed (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, emergencies).  Individual components may be used in some of these settings with careful consideration.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are frequently necessary based on patient-specific factors like renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and gastrointestinal upset.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Hepatotoxicity, allergic reactions, blood dyscrasias, cardiovascular events (with diclofenac), and severe gastrointestinal bleeding.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential for gastrointestinal issues (ulcers, bleeding) with prolonged diclofenac use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis,  anaphylaxis, agranulocytosis.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any component, active peptic ulcer disease, severe hepatic or renal impairment,  aspirin-sensitive asthma, and late pregnancy.

## **Drug Interactions**

Diclofenac interacts with anticoagulants, lithium, methotrexate, and other NSAIDs.  Chlorzoxazone can interact with CNS depressants. Dicyclomine can interact with other anticholinergics, MAO inhibitors, and some antidepressants. Alcohol should be avoided.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Generally avoided during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, due to potential for premature closure of the ductus arteriosus (diclofenac) and other risks.  Use with caution during breastfeeding due to potential excretion into breast milk.

## **Popular Combinations**

This is not a standard or FDA-approved combination. Individual components are frequently used in other combination products. 


## **Precautions**

Carefully evaluate patients for pre-existing conditions like renal or hepatic disease, cardiovascular disease, or gastrointestinal disorders.  Caution in the elderly. Avoid alcohol.  May impair alertness; caution with driving or operating machinery.
