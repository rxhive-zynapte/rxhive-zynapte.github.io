## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the relief of musculoskeletal pain and spasms. It is often associated with conditions such as low back pain, sprains, strains, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and post-operative pain.  It is also used to treat headache, joint pain, body pain, muscle strain, viral fever, and joint stiffness.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination includes a Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) - Diclofenac, an analgesic and antipyretic - Paracetamol, a muscle relaxant - Chlorzoxazone, and an H2-receptor antagonist (antacid) - Famotidine.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis (mediators of pain and inflammation). Paracetamol acts centrally on the brain's pain and temperature-regulating centers. Chlorzoxazone acts centrally on the spinal cord and subcortical areas of the brain to inhibit reflexes that cause muscle spasms. Famotidine reduces gastric acid secretion, protecting the stomach lining from potential irritation caused by Diclofenac.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication does not have an international nonproprietary name (INN). It is marketed under various brand names such as Dicwoz MR and Andic-MR. Other brand names may exist depending on the manufacturer.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Diclofenac reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, thereby suppressing prostaglandin synthesis. Paracetamol is believed to inhibit COX enzymes primarily in the central nervous system, with minimal peripheral effects, and has central effects on serotonergic pathways.  Chlorzoxazone depresses polysynaptic reflex arcs in the spinal cord and subcortical areas of the brain, leading to muscle relaxation. Famotidine competitively inhibits the action of histamine at the H2 receptors of the parietal cells, reducing gastric acid secretion.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Diclofenac is well-absorbed orally but undergoes first-pass metabolism. Peak plasma levels are reached in 1-2 hours. It is metabolized in the liver and primarily eliminated through the kidneys.
    - Paracetamol is rapidly absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma levels in 30-60 minutes. It is metabolized by the liver, primarily by glucuronidation and sulfation, with a small fraction undergoing CYP450-mediated oxidation to a reactive metabolite. This reactive metabolite is detoxified by conjugation with glutathione and excreted in the urine.
    - Chlorzoxazone is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak plasma concentration occurs in 1-2 hours. It undergoes hepatic metabolism, primarily by CYP2E1, and the metabolites are excreted in the urine.
    - Famotidine is incompletely absorbed orally. Peak plasma levels occur in 1-3 hours. It undergoes minimal metabolism and is primarily eliminated unchanged in the urine, with a small amount excreted in the feces.



## **Dosage**

The dosage of this combination medication is not standardized and varies depending on the specific product and the patient's condition. Always adhere to the prescribing physician's instructions or the product label.  One example of dosage and strength found was: Diclofenac sodium 50 mg, paracetamol 325 mg, and chlorzoxazone 500 mg per tablet. One tablet to be taken three times a day.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  One example found was 1 tablet three times a day.  However, this may vary. The maximum recommended daily dose of diclofenac is 150 mg. The maximum recommended dose of paracetamol is 4 grams. The maximum dose of Chlorzoxazone is 3,000mg. 

#### **Children:** This medication is generally not recommended for children under 12, as safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric populations.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be needed due to age-related decline in renal and hepatic function. Start with lower doses and monitor closely.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be necessary based on the degree of impairment. Monitor renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Exercise caution and adjust dosage as needed based on liver function. Close monitoring is necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient factors, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other relevant conditions, when determining the appropriate dosage and monitoring.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific medical settings (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, and Emergency Situations) are not standardized and should be determined by the treating physician based on the individual patient's needs.


### **Dosage Adjustments**
Dose modification may be necessary for renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism. Closely monitor patients for adverse effects and adjust the dosage as needed.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
Nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, loss of appetite, dizziness, drowsiness, diarrhea, heartburn, constipation, headache, mild skin rash, tiredness, and upset stomach.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Allergic reactions (difficulty breathing, swelling of face, mouth, and throat, skin rash, itching), gastrointestinal bleeding, liver damage (jaundice, abdominal pain, dark urine), cardiovascular events (chest pain, shortness of breath), and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

### **Long-Term Effects**
Long-term use of NSAIDs like diclofenac can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, and cardiovascular complications. Chronic use of paracetamol, especially at high doses, can lead to liver damage.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Clinically significant ADRs requiring immediate intervention include severe allergic reactions, gastrointestinal bleeding, signs of liver damage (jaundice, abdominal pain, dark urine), symptoms suggesting heart attack or stroke (chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness on one side of the body), blood dyscrasias (unusual bleeding or bruising), and severe skin reactions.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication
- Active peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding
- Severe hepatic or renal impairment
- Aspirin-induced asthma or urticaria
- Last trimester of pregnancy
- Heart failure
- History of GI bleeding or perforation related to previous NSAID therapy
- Porphyria
- Intolerance to Chlorzoxazone.


## **Drug Interactions**

This combination can interact with many drugs, including anticoagulants, antihypertensives, other NSAIDs, methotrexate, lithium, digoxin, some antibiotics, antidepressants (duloxetine), antipsychotics (lithium), cardiac glycosides (digoxin), anti-rheumatoid drugs (methotrexate), bronchodilators (albuterol), vitamin B12, potassium-sparing diuretics, and alcohol.  It is always best to check for interactions with any medication or supplement before use.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
