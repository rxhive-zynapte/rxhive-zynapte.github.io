## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the relief of acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions accompanied by muscle spasms.  Conditions such as sprains, strains, low back pain, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and post-surgical pain are commonly treated with this combination.  It also provides relief from myalgia (muscle pain), headaches, and traumatic muscle injuries.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Analgesic (Paracetamol, Diclofenac), Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) (Diclofenac), Muscle Relaxant (Chlorzoxazone), Antipyretic (Paracetamol)
- **Mechanism of Action:** Chlorzoxazone acts centrally on the spinal cord and brain to inhibit muscle spasm reflexes. Diclofenac, an NSAID, inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, reducing pain and inflammation. Paracetamol provides analgesic and antipyretic effects by acting on the central nervous system.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate generic names exist. Regional variations in naming conventions may occur.
- **Brand Names:** Diclotal+ MR, Mobizox, Myospaz Forte, Powergesic MR, CIP ZOX, StayHappi, Orthofec-MR, Kritdec-MR, Dichil-MR.  Note: Brand names can vary depending on the region and manufacturer.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Chlorzoxazone depresses reflexes in the spinal cord and subcortical areas of the brain, reducing muscle spasms. Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, decreasing prostaglandin production and thus reducing pain and inflammation.  Paracetamol's exact mechanism is not fully understood but is thought to involve inhibition of COX enzymes in the central nervous system and modulation of the endocannabinoid system.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** All three drugs are absorbed orally. Diclofenac reaches peak plasma concentrations in 1-2 hours, Paracetamol in 30-60 minutes, and Chlorzoxazone in 1-2 hours.  Diclofenac and Chlorzoxazone are extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP enzymes, with some metabolites being pharmacologically active. Paracetamol is also metabolized in the liver, mainly by glucuronidation and sulfation.  All three are eliminated primarily through renal excretion, with a small percentage eliminated through the biliary route.
- **Mode of Action:** Chlorzoxazone acts centrally to suppress muscle spasm reflexes. Diclofenac inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, reducing prostaglandin production and thereby inflammation and pain. Paracetamol's mechanism of action is still under investigation, but it likely involves central inhibition of COX enzymes.  The combination provides synergistic pain relief by targeting different aspects of pain and inflammation.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Diclofenac, Chlorzoxazone, and Paracetamol are primarily eliminated renally. Hepatic metabolism plays a crucial role, particularly for Diclofenac and Chlorzoxazone, involving CYP enzymes in their biotransformation.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- One tablet two to three times daily is a typical starting dose.  Specific dosages depend on the individual componentsâ€™ strengths.  The maximum daily dose is often limited by the diclofenac component (150mg/day) and paracetamol (4g/day).  Always adhere to the specific product's prescribed dosage and frequency.
- Tablets should be swallowed whole with water, preferably with or after food, to minimize gastrointestinal upset.

#### **Children:**

- This combination is generally not recommended for children under 12 years old.  For children over 12, dosages should be adjusted and recommended by a pediatrician, considering factors like weight and age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and monitor closely for side effects. Dose adjustments may be needed based on renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce the dose based on the degree of impairment to prevent drug accumulation and adverse effects.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution and at reduced doses, as these drugs are metabolized in the liver. Close monitoring of liver function is essential.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Carefully consider potential drug interactions and adjust the dose as needed, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal disorders, or bleeding disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- The combination is not typically indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.  These cases require targeted medications based on the specific clinical needs.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments are essential in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms that affect drug metabolism. Carefully evaluate the patient's individual circumstances and modify the dose according to their specific needs and clinical response.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, heartburn, loss of appetite, dry mouth, mild skin rash, headache, lightheadedness, weakness, sleepiness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (difficulty breathing, facial swelling, skin rash, itching), liver damage (jaundice, dark urine, abdominal pain), gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers, cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke).

### **Long-Term Effects**

-  Long-term use of NSAIDs like diclofenac carries the risk of cardiovascular complications and renal impairment.  Long-term use of paracetamol at high doses can lead to liver damage.  Chronic use of chlorzoxazone can potentially lead to dependency.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema), Steven-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute liver failure, gastrointestinal perforation, severe blood dyscrasias.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation.
- Active or history of recurrent peptic ulcer/hemorrhage.
- Severe heart failure, hepatic failure, or renal failure.
- Last trimester of pregnancy.
- Bleeding disorders.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Alcohol, other NSAIDs, anticoagulants (warfarin, rivaroxaban), antihypertensives, diuretics, digoxin, methotrexate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, quinolone antibiotics, antidiabetics, phenytoin, metoclopramide, domperidone, opioid medications, antipsychotics, anti-anxiety medications, pemetrexed, colestipol, cholestyramine, other muscle relaxants.
- CYP450 interactions can occur.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  C (Diclofenac and Chlorzoxazone), B (Paracetamol).  The combination is not recommended during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester due to risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Data on earlier trimesters are inconclusive.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Consult a doctor before use.  Data regarding excretion in breast milk and potential neonatal side effects for the combination product are limited.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Muscle relaxation, pain relief, anti-inflammation.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, stomach upset, liver toxicity (rare).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, peptic ulcers, severe heart/liver/kidney disease, last trimester pregnancy.
- **Drug Interactions:**  NSAIDS, anticoagulants, alcohol.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.  Consult doctor.
- **Dosage:** Varies based on patient condition and drug formulation. Typically 1 tablet 2-3 times/day for adults.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver and kidney function, blood pressure.

## **Popular Combinations**

- While this medication itself is a combination, it's important to avoid combining it with other NSAIDs or medications containing paracetamol to prevent overdose.

## **Precautions**

- Screening for allergies, pre-existing medical conditions, and drug interactions is crucial before prescribing.
