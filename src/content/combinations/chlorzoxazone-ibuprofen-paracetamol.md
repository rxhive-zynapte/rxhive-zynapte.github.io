## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the short-term relief of acute musculoskeletal pain associated with muscle spasm.  This typically includes conditions like low back pain, sprains, strains, and other similar injuries.

It's **pharmacological classification** is as follows:
- Chlorzoxazone: Skeletal Muscle Relaxant
- Ibuprofen: Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID)
- Paracetamol: Analgesic and Antipyretic

The mechanism of action involves a synergistic effect of the three components. Chlorzoxazone acts centrally on the spinal cord to reduce muscle spasms. Ibuprofen reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Paracetamol offers additional pain relief and fever reduction by acting on the central nervous system.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no officially recognized alternate name for this specific fixed-dose combination. However, it's often referred to simply by its constituent drug names. It is marketed under various brand names, including "Flexon MR", "Dolomed MR" among others. Regional variations in brand names may exist.

## **How It Works**

### Pharmacodynamics:

- **Chlorzoxazone:** Acts centrally on the spinal cord and possibly at supraspinal sites, suppressing muscle spasm reflexes. The exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve inhibition of polysynaptic reflexes.
- **Ibuprofen:** Inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, responsible for prostaglandin synthesis. This reduces inflammation, pain, and fever.
- **Paracetamol:** The precise mechanism is debated, but it is believed to inhibit COX enzymes predominantly in the central nervous system, reducing pain and fever. It also appears to have effects on the endocannabinoid and serotoninergic systems.

### Pharmacokinetics:

- **Absorption:** All three drugs are well-absorbed orally. Ibuprofen absorption can be delayed by food intake.
- **Metabolism:** Chlorzoxazone is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2E1, with minor contributions from CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. Ibuprofen undergoes hepatic metabolism, primarily by CYP2C9. Paracetamol is mainly metabolized in the liver through glucuronidation and sulfation pathways. A small portion undergoes CYP2E1-mediated oxidation to form a potentially toxic metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), which is normally detoxified by glutathione.
- **Elimination:** Chlorzoxazone metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Ibuprofen is excreted mainly in the urine as metabolites and unchanged drug. Paracetamol metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One tablet (Chlorzoxazone 250mg + Ibuprofen 400mg + Paracetamol 325mg) three times daily, taken orally after meals.  Maximum dosage should not exceed two tablets per dose or six tablets in a 24-hour period.

#### **Children:**

This combination is generally *not* recommended for children younger than 6 years of age or weighing less than 20 kg. Usage and dosage in older children should be determined by a pediatrician, considering factors such as weight and the specific medical condition. Caution is advised due to potential kidney problems, especially in dehydrated children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lowest effective dose and titrate upwards as needed, monitoring for adverse effects. Age-related decline in liver and kidney function should be considered.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustments may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment.  Close monitoring is required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction is recommended due to impaired metabolism. Avoid use in severe liver disease.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution should be exercised in patients with cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, bleeding disorders, and asthma. Individualized dosing may be required based on the specific condition.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is *not* typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or intensive care. Its use is primarily limited to short-term management of musculoskeletal pain and spasm in outpatient settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are necessary for elderly patients, those with hepatic or renal impairment, and patients with other comorbid conditions. This should be determined on a case-by-case basis, considering the patient's specific situation.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, indigestion, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, stomach pain, heartburn, restlessness, skin rash, and itching.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (e.g., skin rash, hives, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue, difficulty breathing), gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcers, acute liver injury, kidney problems, heart attack or stroke (increased risk with prolonged use), fluid retention, changes in blood pressure, blood disorders (e.g., thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term use of NSAIDs like ibuprofen can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, kidney damage, and cardiovascular issues. Long-term use of paracetamol, especially at high doses, carries the risk of liver damage.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hepatotoxicity, renal failure, myocardial infarction, stroke.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication
- Active peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding
- Severe liver or kidney impairment
- Asthma or history of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease
- History of allergic reaction to NSAIDs
- Perioperative period of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery
- Third trimester of pregnancy

## **Drug Interactions**

- Other NSAIDs, aspirin, and salicylates: Increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects and bleeding
- Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, heparin): Increased risk of bleeding
- Corticosteroids: Increased risk of gastrointestinal ulcers
- Lithium, methotrexate: Increased blood levels and potential toxicity
- Antihypertensives, diuretics: Reduced efficacy of these medications
- Alcohol: Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and liver damage
- CYP450 enzyme inhibitors and inducers: May alter the metabolism of chlorzoxazone and ibuprofen


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

This combination is not recommended during the third trimester of pregnancy due to the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in the fetus. Use during the first and second trimesters should be carefully considered and discussed with a physician. The safety during breastfeeding is uncertain. While small amounts of the drugs may be excreted in breast milk, it is not clear if it poses a risk to the infant. Consulting a physician is recommended.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Chlorzoxazone acts as a muscle relaxant, while ibuprofen reduces pain and inflammation, and paracetamol provides analgesic and antipyretic effects.
