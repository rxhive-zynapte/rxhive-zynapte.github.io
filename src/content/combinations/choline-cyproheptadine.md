## **Usage**

- Choline + Cyproheptadine is prescribed primarily to stimulate appetite and promote weight gain in patients with conditions like anorexia nervosa, inadequate dietary intake, and unintentional weight loss associated with chronic diseases like tuberculosis or HIV/AIDS.  It is also prescribed for underweight children experiencing poor appetite due to various factors such as dietary issues, anemia, liver disease, or digestive disorders.
- **Pharmacological classification**: This combination medication falls under two categories: appetite stimulant (Cyproheptadine) and bile acid sequestrant (Choline).
- **Mechanism of action**: Choline citrate binds to bile acids in the intestine, promoting their excretion. This prompts the liver to utilize cholesterol to produce more bile acids, potentially lowering cholesterol levels. Cyproheptadine acts as an antihistamine and serotonin antagonist, particularly in the hypothalamus, the brain's appetite control center. By blocking serotonin's effect, it stimulates appetite.


## **Alternate Names**

- While "Choline + Cyproheptadine" represents the generic name, there might be slight variations internationally.
- **Brand names**:  The combination is marketed under various brand names which might vary regionally, such as Oraxin, Enzicap, Beterzyme, Zepup Orange. Periactin is the brand name for Cyproheptadine alone.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Choline enhances bile acid excretion, leading to increased cholesterol utilization by the liver. Cyproheptadine antagonizes serotonin receptors in the hypothalamus, stimulating appetite. It also has antihistaminic and anticholinergic properties.
- **Pharmacokinetics**: Cyproheptadine is well-absorbed orally and metabolized primarily in the liver, with renal excretion of metabolites. Choline is also absorbed orally and metabolized in the liver.
- **Mode of action**: Choline acts by binding to bile acids, facilitating their removal.  Cyproheptadine exerts its appetite-stimulating effect by antagonizing serotonin receptors (specifically 5-HT2) in the hypothalamus.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation**: Cyproheptadine antagonizes serotonin (5-HT2), histamine (H1), and muscarinic receptors. Choline's action is not mediated by receptor binding but rather by direct interaction with bile acids.
- **Elimination pathways**: Cyproheptadine is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine as metabolites. Choline is also metabolized in the liver.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults**:

- The total daily dose should not exceed 0.5 mg/kg/day. The usual therapeutic range is 4-20 mg/day, divided into 2-3 doses. Some patients may require up to 32 mg/day.
- Oral administration (syrup, tablet).

#### **Children**:

- Dosage is based on age and weight. For children 2-6 years, the typical starting dose is 2 mg two or three times daily, not to exceed 12 mg/day. For children 7-14 years, the usual dose is 4 mg two or three times a day, not to exceed 16 mg/day.
- Oral administration (syrup, drops).

#### **Special Cases**:

- **Elderly Patients**:  Start with lower doses (e.g., 4 mg twice daily) due to potential age-related decline in metabolic function and increased sensitivity to side effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Reduce dosage and closely monitor for side effects as drug elimination might be decreased.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Dose adjustment might be necessary due to decreased metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**:  Caution should be exercised in patients with glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, asthma, hyperthyroidism, or urinary retention issues.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

-  Dosing for specific clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations is not specifically established for this combination medication.  Dosage adjustments in those cases are often extrapolated from standard and special case recommendations and rely on clinical judgment.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dosage adjustments should be made based on patient-specific factors such as renal/hepatic function, age, weight, concurrent medications, and response to therapy. Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism are not yet well established for this combination.
