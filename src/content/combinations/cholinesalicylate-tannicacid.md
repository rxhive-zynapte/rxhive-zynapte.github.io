## **Usage**

Choline salicylate + tannic acid is primarily used for the topical treatment of mild to moderate pain and inflammation in the mouth and gums, particularly associated with gingivitis, stomatitis, and mouth ulcers.  It belongs to the pharmacological classes of analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents, and astringents.  

The mechanism of action involves the following: Choline salicylate, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, reducing pain and inflammation. Tannic acid acts as an astringent, causing constriction of tissues and reducing bleeding.  

## **Alternate Names**

This combination doesn't have a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN). Regional or international variations may exist.  Brand names include Dent Glow Gum Paint and T-32 Gum Paint. Stomela Jel was a brand that contained this combination along with other ingredients.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Choline salicylate exerts its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, particularly COX-1 and COX-2. This action reduces the production of prostaglandins, key mediators of pain and inflammation.  Tannic acid precipitates proteins, creating a protective layer over the affected area. This astringent effect helps to reduce bleeding, soothe irritation, and promote tissue healing.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Choline salicylate is absorbed through the oral mucosa. Information regarding its specific metabolism and elimination when used topically is limited.  Tannic acid is not readily absorbed through the oral mucosa, and its primary action is local. 

**Mode of Action:** Choline salicylate's mode of action involves non-selective COX inhibition, decreasing prostaglandin synthesis. Tannic acid's mode of action is based on its astringent properties, precipitating proteins to form a protective film and constrict tissues.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** The primary action of choline salicylate involves the inhibition of COX enzymes.  Tannic acid does not directly interact with receptors or modulate neurotransmitters but exerts its effect through protein precipitation and tissue constriction.

**Elimination Pathways:** Information regarding elimination pathways when used topically in this combination is limited. Systemically administered salicylates are primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a small amount of the gel or paint to the affected area 2-3 times daily, preferably after meals and before bedtime.  Use a clean cotton swab or fingertip for application.

#### **Children (6 years and older):** Apply a smaller amount once or twice daily under adult supervision.

#### **Special Cases:**

Limited information is available on dosage modifications for special populations like the elderly or patients with renal/hepatic impairment when used topically.  Consult a healthcare professional for guidance.


### **Clinical Use Cases**
