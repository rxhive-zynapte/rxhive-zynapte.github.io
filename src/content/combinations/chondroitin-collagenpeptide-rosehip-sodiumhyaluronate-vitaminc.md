## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to support joint health, relieve joint pain, and manage symptoms of osteoarthritis.  It isn't classified as a drug like an analgesic or anti-inflammatory, but as a nutraceutical/dietary supplement.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is marketed under various brand names (e.g., Gudmuv, Rofiit, Tendorex-RH, Bonejoy, Tendocel, Flexcure) and often referred to as a "joint health supplement," with no standard international non-proprietary name.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  The components work synergistically to improve joint health.

* **Chondroitin Sulfate:** Promotes water retention and elasticity in cartilage, possibly inhibiting cartilage-degrading enzymes.
* **Collagen Peptide:**  Supplies amino acids for building cartilage, tendons, and ligaments. It may stimulate collagen and hyaluronic acid synthesis within joints and suppress inflammatory mediators.
* **Rosehip Extract:** Contains antioxidants (vitamin C and polyphenols, such as anthocyanins) and anti-inflammatory compounds, potentially reducing joint pain and inflammation.
* **Sodium Hyaluronate:** Enhances joint lubrication and cushioning, minimizing friction and pain.  It increases synovial fluid viscoelasticity and stimulates cartilage production.
* **Vitamin C:** Crucial for collagen synthesis and functions as an antioxidant, aiding new blood vessel formation and healing.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Absorption, metabolism, and elimination information for this specific combination is not readily available. Individual components have varying pharmacokinetic profiles.  Collagen peptides are broken down into amino acids and absorbed in the digestive tract. Chondroitin sulfate has limited bioavailability.  Vitamin C is readily absorbed, with excess excreted in urine.  Sodium hyaluronate and rosehip extract pharmacokinetics are complex.
