## **Usage**

- This combination is prescribed as a nutritional supplement primarily for joint health. It is used to manage osteoarthritis symptoms, reduce joint pain and stiffness, and support cartilage health and regeneration.  It can also be used for general bone and muscle health, and skin health.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Nutritional supplement, Chondroprotective agent


- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination works synergistically to support joint health. Collagen peptide provides the building blocks for cartilage repair, chondroitin sulfate inhibits cartilage breakdown, and sodium hyaluronate improves joint lubrication. Vitamin C, often included, is essential for collagen synthesis and acts as an antioxidant.


## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination, but individual components may be referred to by their chemical names (e.g., chondroitin sulfate sodium).

- **Brand Names:** Many brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and the inclusion of additional ingredients (e.g. vitamins). Some include Tendocare, Tendolife, Onisrin-Plus, Tendofit, and Tendomac.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Collagen peptides provide amino acids for cartilage regeneration, chondroitin sulfate inhibits enzymes that break down cartilage, and sodium hyaluronate improves joint fluid viscosity and lubrication.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Oral absorption of these components varies. Collagen peptides are hydrolyzed for better absorption. Chondroitin sulfate has limited bioavailability. Sodium hyaluronate is also absorbed orally, though its primary mechanism in joint health is via direct injection for some indications. Vitamin C is readily absorbed. Metabolism and elimination pathways for these components are complex and not fully elucidated. Chondroitin Sulfate is eliminated renally.

- **Mode of Action:** Collagen peptides provide structural support to cartilage, chondroitin sulfate inhibits cartilage-degrading enzymes, and sodium hyaluronate acts as a viscosupplement and lubricant in synovial fluid. 

- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Chondroitin sulfate inhibits enzymes like matrix metalloproteinases that degrade cartilage.


## **Dosage**

Because this is a nutritional supplement, standardized dosing guidelines are not available. Dosage varies based on the specific product and manufacturer's recommendation. A common recommendation is 1-2 tablets or capsules daily. Please follow the instructions on the product label, or as directed by a medical professional.
