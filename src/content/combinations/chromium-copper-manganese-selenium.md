## **Usage**

This combination of trace elements is primarily used to prevent or correct deficiencies that may occur in patients receiving parenteral nutrition (PN), also known as intravenous nutrition. These micronutrients play crucial roles in various metabolic processes, and inadequate intake can lead to serious health complications. This combination is not classified under a single pharmacological class like antibiotics or analgesics, but rather acts as a nutritional supplement. The mechanism of action involves providing essential cofactors for numerous enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, including glucose metabolism (chromium), iron metabolism and red blood cell formation (copper), bone formation and wound healing (manganese), and antioxidant defense (selenium).

## **Alternate Names**

This combination does not have a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN). It is often referred to simply as "trace elements" or "trace element solution" in the context of parenteral nutrition.  Brand names can include Tralement, Multitrace-5 Concentrate, and Micro +6 Concentrate, among others. Formulations and specific combinations can vary by brand.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Each element has specific effects:

* **Chromium:** Enhances insulin action, influencing glucose metabolism.
* **Copper:** Cofactor for enzymes involved in iron metabolism, red blood cell formation, and other functions.
* **Manganese:**  Cofactor for enzymes involved in bone formation, wound healing, and metabolic processes.
* **Selenium:**  Antioxidant, component of selenoproteins, protecting against oxidative damage.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Administered intravenously, bypassing absorption.
* **Metabolism:**  Elements become integrated into specific metabolic pathways.
* **Elimination:** Chromium and selenium are excreted in urine and bile/feces; copper and manganese primarily in feces.

The mode of action involves these elements acting as cofactors for various enzymes and selenoproteins, influencing metabolic processes and protecting against oxidative stress. Specific receptor binding or neurotransmitter modulation is not a primary mechanism for these elements in this context. 

## **Dosage**

Dosage is individualized based on patient needs and clinical status, particularly when administered as part of PN.  Dosage recommendations are often based on guidelines from professional organizations like the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN).

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Recommendations vary depending on the specific product and patient needs. Always refer to the product's prescribing information and consider consulting with a pharmacist or clinical dietitian specializing in PN.  In general, 1 mL of a standard trace element solution per day is added to parenteral nutrition for adults weighing at least 50 kg.  Individual element requirements: zinc (3-5 mg), copper (0.3-0.5 mg), manganese (55 mcg), selenium (60-100 mcg), chromium (â‰¤10 mcg).

#### **Children:**

Pediatric dosing is weight-based and needs careful consideration to avoid exceeding safe limits, especially for manganese.  Dosing is typically calculated as 0.2-0.8 mL of a standard trace element solution per kg per day, added to PN. Supplementation with individual trace elements may be needed, as commercial multi-trace element products may not fully meet pediatric needs.  It's critical to refer to the specific product's prescribing information and consult with experts. For premature infants, trace element requirements are further differentiated based on body weight.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Similar considerations as adults, with close monitoring for any signs of toxicity or deficiency.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised; dose reduction or omission of certain elements (e.g., selenium) may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Copper and manganese can accumulate; dose reduction or omission may be required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Dosage adjustments should be made on a case-by-case basis depending on the specific comorbidity. 

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The primary clinical use case is as a component of PN in various settings, including:

* **Intubation:** When oral intake is not possible.
* **Surgical Procedures:** Post-operatively to support nutritional needs.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** When nutritional support is crucial.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** For critically ill patients.
* **Emergency Situations:** To maintain nutritional status during acute illness.

Dosage in these settings is individualized and guided by patient-specific factors and ASPEN guidelines.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on:

* Renal/hepatic impairment
* GI malfunction
* Cholestasis, biliary dysfunction, cirrhosis
* Long-term PN, where elevated levels of certain trace elements can occur
* Plasma levels of trace elements, along with clinical monitoring.

## **Side Effects**

Side effects at recommended doses are infrequent. Toxicity is possible with excessive amounts, especially with long-term PN.

### **Common Side Effects:**

Generally, well-tolerated at recommended doses.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Toxicity of individual elements (copper, manganese, selenium) can occur with excessive intake, especially in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Hepatic accumulation of copper and manganese can occur with prolonged use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

ADRs related to iodine (goiter, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism) have been reported. ADRs necessitate immediate discontinuation and supportive treatment.  D-penicillamine can be used for copper toxicity.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation.
* Undiluted peripheral administration can cause phlebitis.



## **Drug Interactions**

Limited data exists on specific drug interactions. Caution is advised with concurrent medications, especially those affecting excretion or metabolism of trace elements.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

These trace elements are essential during pregnancy and lactation. Adequate intake is crucial. Consult resources for appropriate recommendations during these periods.  Dosing adjustments based on maternal needs are necessary. It's crucial to monitor and adjust as needed, considering individual patient factors and consulting with clinical resources.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Provides essential cofactors for enzymes involved in various metabolic processes.
* **Side Effects:**  Generally infrequent at recommended doses; toxicity possible with excessive amounts.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, undiluted peripheral administration.
* **Drug Interactions:** Limited data, caution advised.
