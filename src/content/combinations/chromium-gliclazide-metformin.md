## **Usage**

This combination is prescribed for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, specifically when blood sugar control is inadequate with Metformin alone.  It addresses nutritional deficiencies, particularly chromium deficiency, which can impact glucose metabolism. Although this specific combination is not available as a standard fixed-dose combination globally, Metformin and Gliclazide are frequently prescribed together, with Chromium sometimes added as a supplement. It falls under the pharmacological classification of antidiabetic agents, combining drugs with different mechanisms of action to enhance glycemic control.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no officially recognized alternate names for this combination as a whole. Individually, Metformin is sometimes called Glucophage, Gliclazide is also known as Diamicron, while different forms of Chromium exist (e.g., chromium picolinate, chromium polynicotinate). Brand names for combinations containing two or all three of these components vary regionally and may not be standardized.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Chromium enhances insulin action, making it more effective at lowering blood sugar. Gliclazide stimulates insulin release from the pancreas. Metformin lowers hepatic glucose production and improves peripheral glucose uptake, reducing the amount of glucose released by the liver and increasing insulin sensitivity in muscles and fat tissues.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Gliclazide is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine. Metformin is minimally metabolized and primarily excreted by the kidneys. Chromium absorption and excretion are complex and depend on the specific form of chromium.

**Mode of Action:**

* **Chromium:** Enhances insulin signaling pathways, improving glucose transport into cells.
* **Gliclazide:** Binds to sulfonylurea receptors on pancreatic beta-cells, stimulating insulin secretion.
* **Metformin:** Activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), leading to decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis and increased peripheral glucose uptake. It is believed to act independent of pancreatic insulin release.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Gliclazide primarily via hepatic metabolism and renal excretion. Metformin mainly through renal excretion. Chromium excretion pathways are complex and vary based on the form ingested.

## **Dosage**

Dosage needs to be individualized based on patient response and clinical factors.  It's crucial to monitor blood glucose, HbA1c, renal function, and potentially liver function.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

This combination is not typically available as a fixed-dose combination internationally.  If prescribed concurrently, dosages are individualized. Gliclazide usually starts at 40-80 mg daily, titrated up as needed. Metformin often begins at 500 mg twice daily with meals, increasing gradually. Chromium dosages, if supplemental, depend on the specific form.

#### **Children:** 

Metformin is approved for use in children 10 years and older. However, the use of gliclazide or chromium supplements in the pediatric population should be carefully considered and is generally avoided.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and titrate cautiously due to age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Metformin is contraindicated in severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 mÂ²) and used with caution in moderate impairment. Dosage adjustments may be needed for Gliclazide and Chromium.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use Metformin with caution.  Dose adjustments may be required for Gliclazide and Chromium.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other conditions that may affect drug metabolism or clearance.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is not typically used in acute settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  It is designed for long-term management of type 2 diabetes.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjust doses based on blood glucose monitoring, renal/hepatic function, other medications, and comorbid conditions.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Hypoglycemia, nausea, taste change, diarrhea, stomach pain, headache, upper respiratory tract infections.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Lactic acidosis (with Metformin), severe hypoglycemia, blood disorders.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Vitamin B12 deficiency (Metformin).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Lactic acidosis, severe hypoglycemia requiring hospitalization.

## **Contraindications**

Type 1 diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis, severe renal impairment, severe hepatic impairment, hypersensitivity to any of the components.

## **Drug Interactions**

Alcohol (increased lactic acidosis risk with Metformin), other antidiabetic agents (additive hypoglycemic effects), drugs affecting renal function, NSAIDs (increased hypoglycemia risk), CYP450 interactions (Gliclazide).

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding, only if clearly needed. Metformin is generally preferred over Gliclazide during pregnancy. Chromium supplementation should not exceed recommended dietary allowances.

## **Popular Combinations**

Metformin and Gliclazide are often prescribed together.  Chromium may be added as a supplement.


## **Precautions**

Monitor renal function (especially in the elderly), blood glucose, and educate patients on hypoglycemia. Monitor liver function if necessary.
