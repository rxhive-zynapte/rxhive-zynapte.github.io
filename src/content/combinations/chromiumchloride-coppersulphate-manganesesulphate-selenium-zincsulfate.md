## **Usage**

This combination of minerals is primarily used to treat or prevent deficiencies of chromium, copper, manganese, selenium, and zinc, especially in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). These micronutrients are essential for various physiological functions. It is classified as a nutritional supplement.

## **Alternate Names**

While this specific combination doesn't have a unique international non-proprietary name (INN), it is sometimes referred to as "trace element supplement for parenteral nutrition."  Brand names include Trace I.V. Injection, Tracemax Injection, and Tracerise Injection.  The individual components are also known by their chemical names: Chromium Chloride (CrCl3), Copper Sulphate (CuSO4), Manganese Sulphate (MnSO4), Selenium (Se), and Zinc Sulfate (ZnSO4).

## **How It Works**

This combination provides essential trace elements crucial for enzymatic activities, metabolic processes, and cellular functions.

* **Chromium:** Enhances insulin action, influencing glucose metabolism, and supports peripheral nerve function.
* **Copper:** Essential for red and white blood cell formation, iron transport, and maintaining healthy nerves, blood vessels, bones, and the immune system.
* **Manganese:** Plays a role in enzyme activation, bone development, cholesterol, glucose, amino acid, and carbohydrate metabolism, blood clotting, and reducing inflammation.
* **Selenium:** Functions as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage and the toxic effects of heavy metals and free radicals.
* **Zinc:** Supports immune function, cell growth, wound healing, gut health, and the senses of taste and smell. It also aids in insulin crystallization and release.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) vary for each mineral.  Zinc and chromium are primarily excreted in urine; copper and manganese are mainly eliminated through bile; selenium is excreted via urine and feces.

## **Dosage**

Dosages are individualized based on clinical condition and serum levels of each trace element.  It's administered intravenously after dilution in a compatible parenteral solution.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Zinc:** 2.5-4 mg/day (increase to 2 mg/day in acute catabolic states or adjust further based on fluid loss).
* **Copper:** 0.5-1.5 mg/day.
* **Manganese:** 0.15-0.8 mg/day.
* **Chromium:** 10-15 mcg/day (increase to 20 mcg/day with intestinal fluid loss).
* **Selenium:** 20-40 mcg/day, or possibly up to 60mcg/day.

#### **Children:** Dosages are based on body weight and specific clinical guidelines (e.g., ASPEN).

* **Zinc:** Consult pediatric guidelines (<3 kg premature infants: 2-10 mcg/kg/day; infants and children: 0.2mcg/kg/day).
* **Copper:** 20-80 mcg/kg/day.
* **Manganese:** 2-10 mcg/kg/day.
* **Chromium:** 0.14-0.20 mcg/kg/day.
* **Selenium:** <3 kg premature infants: 1-3 mcg/kg/day; infants and children: 2-10 mcg/kg/day.



#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Adjust based on renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce dosage based on glomerular filtration rate, especially for chromium.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Reduce dosage, especially for copper and manganese.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual mineral needs and potential interactions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is generally used as a supplement during TPN in various clinical settings like:

* **Intubation**
* **Surgical Procedures**
* **Mechanical Ventilation**
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are necessary based on renal/hepatic function, metabolic disorders, or other patient-specific factors influencing drug metabolism.

## **Side Effects**

Side effects are typically mild and resolve upon discontinuation or dose adjustment of the specific mineral.  Injection site reactions (pain, swelling, redness) are common.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Toxicity can occur with excessive doses of individual components. Refer to individual mineral monographs for specific toxicities.

## **Contraindications**

* Known hypersensitivity to any component.
* Conditions not requiring supplementation of all five trace elements.


## **Drug Interactions**

* Antacids can reduce absorption of trace minerals.
* Interactions are possible with individual components and some medications (e.g., antibiotics, antihypertensives). Consult individual mineral monographs and drug interaction resources.
* Concomitant use of phosphorus-containing dairy products should be avoided or separated by at least 2 hours before/after zinc administration.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.  Consult recommended daily allowances for each mineral.
* **Breastfeeding:** Exercise caution; the safety profile is not well-established.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

This combination is not a single drug, so a comprehensive drug profile summary isn't applicable. Refer to the individual component monographs for specific information.

## **Popular Combinations**

These minerals are frequently found together in multivitamin/mineral supplements for TPN, but this precise formulation is not a recognized "popular combination" outside of its usage in TPN settings.


## **Precautions**

Assess for pre-existing mineral imbalances or conditions that could be aggravated by supplementation. Specific age-related precautions exist for children and the elderly. For pregnant or breastfeeding women, use with caution if benefits outweigh potential risks.
