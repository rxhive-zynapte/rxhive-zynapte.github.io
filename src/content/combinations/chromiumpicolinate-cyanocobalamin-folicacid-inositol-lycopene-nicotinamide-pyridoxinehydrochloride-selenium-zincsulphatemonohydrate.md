## **Usage**

This combination of micronutrients is primarily used to address or prevent deficiencies in specific vitamins and minerals. It's prescribed for conditions like vitamin B12 deficiency, folic acid deficiency, chromium deficiency, and other general nutritional deficiencies.  It may also be prescribed to support overall health and wellbeing.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Vitamin and mineral supplement.  It is not classified as a single drug but rather a combination of essential nutrients.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Each component has its own mechanism:
    - Chromium Picolinate: Enhances insulin sensitivity.
    - Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12): Coenzyme for metabolic processes, crucial for nerve function and red blood cell production.
    - Folic Acid: Essential for DNA synthesis and cell division.
    - Inositol:  Plays a role in cell signaling and may have benefits for mental health.
    - Lycopene: Antioxidant.
    - Nicotinamide (Vitamin B3): Precursor to NAD and NADP, involved in energy metabolism.
    - Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6): Coenzyme in amino acid metabolism.
    - Selenium: Antioxidant, component of selenoproteins.
    - Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate: Cofactor for numerous enzymes, supporting immune function and wound healing.



## **Alternate Names**

This combination lacks a universally recognized single alternate name.  It's often referred to as a multivitamin and mineral supplement. It's marketed under various brand names, including Z&B.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** This combination exerts its effects through the combined actions of its individual components.  It impacts various physiological processes like metabolism, nerve function, cell growth, immune response, and antioxidant defense.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** The pharmacokinetics varies for each component. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination pathways differ.
- **Mode of Action:** The individual components act at the cellular and molecular level.  For example, cyanocobalamin acts as a coenzyme for methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Folic acid is crucial for one-carbon transfer reactions. Zinc is a cofactor for numerous enzymes.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Specific actions include chromium's influence on insulin receptors, and pyridoxine's role as a coenzyme in neurotransmitter synthesis.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Elimination occurs through various routes, including renal and hepatic excretion.
