## **Usage**

This combination of micronutrients is generally prescribed to address deficiencies in these specific nutrients, which can arise due to various factors such as inadequate dietary intake, malabsorption, increased demand (e.g., pregnancy), or certain medical conditions.  It is commonly used to support overall health and well-being, and may be specifically indicated in cases of:

* **Megaloblastic anemia:**  Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) and folic acid are essential for red blood cell formation. Deficiency in either can lead to this type of anemia.
* **Peripheral neuropathy:**  Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency can cause peripheral nerve damage, resulting in numbness, tingling, and pain in the extremities.
* **Diabetes and insulin resistance:** Chromium picolinate is believed to enhance insulin action and may be beneficial in managing blood sugar levels in individuals with diabetes or insulin resistance.
* **Zinc deficiency:** Zinc is crucial for immune function, wound healing, and cell growth. Zinc sulfate monohydrate supplementation is used to treat zinc deficiency.
* **Selenium deficiency:** Selenium is an antioxidant and plays a role in thyroid hormone metabolism. Selenious acid is used to address selenium deficiency.
* **General nutritional support:** This combination can be used to ensure adequate intake of these essential micronutrients in individuals with poor dietary habits, malabsorption issues, or increased requirements.


This combination falls under the **pharmacological classification** of nutritional supplements.

The **mechanism of action** of this combination is based on the individual actions of each component. Chromium is believed to improve insulin signaling, thereby improving glucose metabolism. B vitamins are important coenzymes involved in multiple metabolic processes, including energy production, DNA synthesis, and neurotransmitter synthesis. Zinc is crucial for immune function and cell division, and selenium and nicotinamide act as antioxidants.


## **Alternate Names**

This combination drug does not have a specific international nonproprietary name (INN). It is referred to by the names of its individual components.

Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and the specific formulation.  



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The effects of this combination are driven by the individual components.  Chromium enhances insulin sensitivity, influencing glucose metabolism. B vitamins act as coenzymes in various metabolic processes, including energy production, DNA synthesis, and neurotransmitter synthesis. Zinc is crucial for immune function, cell division, and protein synthesis.  Selenium is an antioxidant and is important for thyroid hormone metabolism. Nicotinamide also plays a role as an antioxidant.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Each component has a different pharmacokinetic profile. Chromium is absorbed poorly in the gastrointestinal tract and is excreted primarily through the kidneys. Cyanocobalamin requires intrinsic factor for absorption and is stored in the liver. Folic acid is absorbed in the small intestine. Nicotinamide is readily absorbed and metabolized in the liver. Pyridoxine is absorbed in the jejunum. Zinc is absorbed in the small intestine and transported bound to albumin. Selenium is absorbed in the small intestine and excreted in the urine.
