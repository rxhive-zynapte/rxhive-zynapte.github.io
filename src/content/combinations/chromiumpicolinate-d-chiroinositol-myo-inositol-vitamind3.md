## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to address symptoms associated with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), such as:

*   Insulin resistance
*   Menstrual irregularities
*   Difficulty ovulating

It is also used to improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Nutritional supplement, insulin sensitizer.

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination works through the synergistic action of its components:

*   **Chromium Picolinate:** Enhances insulin action, improving glucose metabolism.
*   **D-Chiro Inositol and Myo-Inositol:** Improve insulin signaling and ovarian function, promoting hormonal balance and regular ovulation.
*   **Vitamin D3:** Contributes to insulin function and helps regulate menstruation, supporting overall metabolic and reproductive health.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no specific alternate names for this combination as a generic medicine. It's marketed under various brand names.
Some Popular Brand Names includes:

*Mayosafe Tablet
*Pcoshe Tablet
*Zipcoz Tablet



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

*   **Chromium Picolinate:** Potentiates insulin activity, improving glucose uptake and utilization by cells.
*   **Inositols:** Act as secondary messengers in insulin signaling pathways, improving insulin sensitivity and reducing hyperandrogenism in PCOS.
*   **Vitamin D3:** Modulates insulin secretion and sensitivity, playing a role in glucose homeostasis. Additionally, it influences reproductive hormone balance.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** The components are absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract.
*   **Metabolism:** Primarily hepatic metabolism for vitamin D3.
*   **Elimination:** Mainly renal excretion for chromium and inositols, bile excretion for vitamin D3 metabolites.
