## **Usage**

- This triple therapy is prescribed for the maintenance treatment of moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults, particularly those with a history of exacerbations despite dual bronchodilator therapy.  It is also used in some cases for severe asthma uncontrolled by other medications.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  This combination drug includes a corticosteroid (Ciclesonide), a long-acting beta2-agonist (Formoterol), and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (Tiotropium).  Hence, it's classified as a combination respiratory stimulant.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Ciclesonide reduces airway inflammation, Formoterol relaxes airway smooth muscle through beta2-adrenergic receptor agonism, and Tiotropium blocks muscarinic receptors, further promoting bronchodilation.

## **Alternate Names**

- No formally recognized alternate names exist for the combination itself.  The components have various salt forms (e.g., tiotropium bromide, formoterol fumarate).
- **Brand Names:** Triohale, R/C TIOTROPIN 3D, Fortropium C


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The combined effect of the three drugs leads to significant bronchodilation and reduction of airway inflammation. This improves lung function, reduces symptoms like breathlessness and wheezing, and decreases the frequency of exacerbations in COPD.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Ciclesonide:** Administered via inhalation, converted to its active metabolite in the lungs, minimizing systemic side effects. It undergoes hepatic metabolism.
    - **Formoterol:**  Inhaled, reaching peak plasma concentrations rapidly.  It's metabolized primarily via direct glucuronidation and renal excretion.
    - **Tiotropium:** Inhaled, with slow systemic absorption.  Primarily excreted unchanged in urine and feces, with a long duration of action.
- **Mode of Action:**  Ciclesonide binds to glucocorticoid receptors, inhibiting inflammatory mediators.  Formoterol activates beta2-adrenergic receptors, increasing cAMP and relaxing airway smooth muscle.  Tiotropium competitively blocks muscarinic receptors (M1, M2, M3), preventing bronchoconstriction.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Ciclesonide (hepatic metabolism), Formoterol (renal excretion, glucuronidation), Tiotropium (renal and fecal excretion of unchanged drug).


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- One inhalation (containing specified strengths of each drug, e.g. Triohale: ciclesonide 200 mcg, formoterol 6 mcg, tiotropium 9mcg.  R/C TIOTROPIN 3D: ciclesonide 400 mcg, formoterol 12 mcg, tiotropium 18mcg.) once daily, usually in the morning, using a dry powder inhaler (DPI) or metered-dose inhaler (MDI).


#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for children under 18 years of age for COPD. Some individual components may be indicated in children for asthma, following appropriate pediatric dosing guidelines.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments are generally not necessary, but monitor for potential side effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Tiotropium should be used with caution in moderate to severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Ciclesonide dose adjustment might be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hyperplasia, bladder neck obstruction, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypokalemia.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is **not** indicated for:

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations**



### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Other anticholinergic drugs (additive effects)
- Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (may increase ciclesonide levels)
- Diuretics (may exacerbate hypokalemia)
- Alcohol (not studied but potentially harmful)


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.  Limited data available.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Safety not established. Excretion into human milk is unknown. Use with caution.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Combination of anti-inflammatory, beta2-agonist, and anticholinergic effects.
- **Side Effects:** Dry mouth, throat irritation, cough, headache, oral thrush, urinary tract infection, rare but potentially serious cardiovascular effects or allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:** Beta-blockers, other anticholinergics, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, diuretics.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if potential benefit outweighs risks.
- **Dosage:** One inhalation once daily.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Lung function (FEV1), symptoms, adverse effects, potassium levels (if on concomitant diuretics).


## **Popular Combinations**

While this combination already contains three drugs, additional medications may be used for uncontrolled symptoms, such as short-acting beta2-agonists (e.g., albuterol) as rescue medication.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Monitor for side effects, ensure proper inhaler technique, assess for comorbid conditions.
- **Specific Populations:** See "Dosage - Special Cases."
- **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Avoid smoking, address environmental triggers, and caution patients about potential dizziness.
