## **Usage**

Ciclopirox + Zinc pyrithione is prescribed for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis, a skin condition affecting primarily the scalp, characterized by redness, scaling, and dandruff.  It is also used for other fungal skin infections like tinea versicolor, tinea corporis, and tinea pedis.

Its pharmacological classification is antifungal.

The mechanism of action involves the synergistic effect of two antifungal agents. Ciclopirox disrupts fungal cell membrane and wall formation, thus impairing fungal cell growth.  Zinc pyrithione increases the permeability of the fungal cell membrane, leading to leakage of essential cellular components and fungal cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

While there isn't a widely recognized alternate generic name, regional variations may exist. Some brand names include 8X Shampoo.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ciclopirox inhibits fungal growth by targeting iron-dependent enzymes crucial for fungal cell wall development.  Zinc pyrithione disrupts cell membrane integrity by chelating metal ions.  The combination is effective against various dermatophytes and yeasts.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Primarily topical application. Absorption is limited. Systemic effects are minimal with topical use. Elimination pathways for absorbed drug are primarily hepatic.  Specific information on metabolism by CYP enzymes isn't readily available for this combination.

**Mode of action:**  Ciclopirox appears to have a multi-pronged approach, possibly through binding and inhibiting certain essential enzymes. This may modulate processes within the fungal cell, making it more susceptible to damage. Zinc pyrithione's mode of action involves disruption of cell membrane integrity, but specific receptor or enzyme targets remain unclear. It might modulate transport across cell membranes and thereby induce cytotoxic effects.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
* **Shampoo:** Apply 1 teaspoon (up to 2 for long hair) twice weekly for 4 weeks, with at least 3 days between applications.
* **Cream/Lotion/Gel:** Apply twice daily, morning and evening.
