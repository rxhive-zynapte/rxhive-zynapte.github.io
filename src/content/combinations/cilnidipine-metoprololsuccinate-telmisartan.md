## **Usage**

- This fixed-dose combination (FDC) medication is primarily prescribed for the treatment of **hypertension** (high blood pressure) in adults. It is particularly beneficial for patients who require multiple antihypertensive agents to achieve their blood pressure goals or those already taking the individual components separately.  This combination therapy may also be used in patients who are at high risk of cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antihypertensive (a combination of a calcium channel blocker, a beta-blocker, and an angiotensin II receptor blocker).
- **Mechanism of Action:** This FDC lowers blood pressure through three distinct mechanisms:
    - **Cilnidipine:** Inhibits calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle cells, causing vasodilation and reducing peripheral resistance. It also possesses a dual L/N-type calcium channel blocking activity.
    - **Metoprolol Succinate:**  A beta-1 selective adrenergic receptor blocker that decreases heart rate, cardiac output, and renin release, thereby lowering blood pressure. The succinate formulation provides extended release.
    - **Telmisartan:** An angiotensin II receptor blocker that inhibits the binding of angiotensin II to its receptor, leading to vasodilation and a reduction in aldosterone secretion.

## **Alternate Names**

- There is no officially recognized alternate name for this specific FDC. However, it may be referred to by the names of its individual components or the combination described as a triple therapy for hypertension.
- **Brand Names:** This FDC is marketed under various brand names like Cadmet Trio 25, Met XL Trio 25, Metosartan LN 25, Telista MCL 25, Cilacar TM 25, Tsart MCL 25, Telma LNB 25.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The combined effect of the three drugs results in a synergistic reduction in blood pressure. Cilnidipine acts on the peripheral vasculature, Metoprolol reduces cardiac output, and Telmisartan blocks the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** All three drugs are absorbed orally. Metoprolol succinate is formulated for extended release, providing a more consistent blood level.
    - **Metabolism:** Cilnidipine and Metoprolol are primarily metabolized by the liver, specifically by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes respectively. Telmisartan undergoes glucuronidation in the liver.
    - **Elimination:** The drugs and their metabolites are eliminated primarily through renal and hepatic routes.
- **Mode of Action:**
    - Cilnidipine: Blocks L-type and N-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle, preventing calcium influx and thus muscle contraction.
    - Metoprolol: Competitively binds to beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, reducing sympathetic stimulation and lowering heart rate and contractility.
    - Telmisartan: Selectively blocks the AT1 receptor subtype, preventing angiotensin II from binding and exerting its vasoconstrictor effects.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**
    - Cilnidipine: Calcium channel blocker.
    - Metoprolol: Beta-1 adrenergic receptor blocker.
    - Telmisartan: Angiotensin II receptor blocker.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly renal and hepatic excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The typical starting dose is one tablet containing Cilnidipine 10mg, Metoprolol Succinate 25mg (extended-release), and Telmisartan 40mg, taken orally once daily. The dosage may be adjusted based on individual patient response and blood pressure control.

#### **Children:** This FDC is not recommended for use in children, as the safety and efficacy have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Dosage should be initiated cautiously in elderly patients due to potential age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment, as it may affect the metabolism of Cilnidipine and Metoprolol.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Careful monitoring is recommended in patients with diabetes, heart failure, or other cardiovascular diseases.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of this FDC in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations has not been established and is generally not recommended.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are made based on individual patient response to therapy, renal and hepatic function, and the presence of other medical conditions.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Headache, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, edema, hypotension, bradycardia, gastrointestinal disturbances (diarrhea, constipation).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe hypotension, bradycardia, heart block, angioedema, liver dysfunction, renal failure.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

The long-term effects of this FDC are still being studied.  However, maintaining good blood pressure control through appropriate medication can significantly reduce the risk of long-term complications associated with hypertension, such as cardiovascular disease and renal failure.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Angioedema, severe hypotension, acute renal failure, hepatotoxicity.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any of the components (Cilnidipine, Metoprolol, Telmisartan).

## **Drug Interactions**

- CYP3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, ritonavir) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine) may increase the plasma concentrations of Cilnidipine and Metoprolol, respectively.
- Other antihypertensive medications can have additive effects.
- NSAIDs can reduce the antihypertensive effect and increase the risk of kidney problems.
- Alcohol can potentiate the hypotensive effects.
- Grapefruit juice can affect the metabolism of Cilnidipine.
- Potassium supplements and a high-potassium diet should be avoided.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- This FDC is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the potential for fetal harm.
