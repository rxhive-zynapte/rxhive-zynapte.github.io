## **Usage**

- Cilnidipine + Olmesartan Medoxomil is prescribed for the treatment of **hypertension** (high blood pressure). It is also used to lower the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes in patients with hypertension.  Some formulations in combination with Chlorthalidone are indicated for the management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with hypertension.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antihypertensive (a combination of a calcium channel blocker and an angiotensin II receptor blocker).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Cilnidipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, inhibits calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle, leading to vasodilation. Olmesartan Medoxomil, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), blocks the binding of angiotensin II to its receptors, preventing vasoconstriction and promoting vasodilation. The combined effect results in a significant reduction in blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate generic names exist.
- **Brand Names:** Several brand names are available depending on the manufacturer and country. Examples include Olkem Cl, Cilidin O, Olmistrum LN, and others. Brand names containing Chlorthalidone include Olkem Trio, Nulong-Trio, and Olnyd Trio.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Cilnidipine reduces peripheral vascular resistance by blocking calcium channels, while Olmesartan Medoxomil blocks the vasoconstricting and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. This dual action effectively lowers blood pressure.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Both drugs are orally administered. Cilnidipine is well-absorbed, extensively metabolized by the liver (CYP3A4), and has a half-life of approximately 6-8 hours. Olmesartan Medoxomil is rapidly converted to its active metabolite, olmesartan, during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. It is primarily excreted unchanged in bile and feces, with a half-life of 10-15 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Cilnidipine primarily blocks L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle, leading to vasodilation. Olmesartan blocks the AT1 subtype of angiotensin II receptors, inhibiting vasoconstriction and the release of aldosterone.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Cilnidipine is primarily metabolized by the liver's CYP3A4 enzymes and eliminated in the urine and feces. Olmesartan is excreted mainly unchanged through the biliary route into the feces, with minimal renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- The starting dose is typically Olmesartan Medoxomil 20 mg + Cilnidipine 10 mg once daily. The dose can be increased to Olmesartan Medoxomil 40 mg + Cilnidipine 10 mg if needed.

#### **Children:**
- Not recommended for children under 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment may be needed based on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Lower starting doses are recommended and caution is advised.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment may be required for Cilnidipine due to its hepatic metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is advised in patients with diabetes, heart failure, or other cardiovascular conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific medical settings is determined based on patient-specific factors and overall clinical assessment. There are no established fixed dosages for clinical use cases such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on individual patient response, renal/hepatic function, and co-administered medications.

- Fatigue
- Nausea
- Peripheral edema (swelling of ankles/feet)
- Diarrhea

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Hypotension (low blood pressure)
- Renal impairment


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term complications are rare when the drug is used as directed and monitored appropriately.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- NSAIDs (may reduce antihypertensive effect)
- Grapefruit juice (may increase Cilnidipine levels)
- St. Johnâ€™s wort (may interact with Olmesartan Medoxomil)
- CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers (may alter Cilnidipine metabolism)


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Contraindicated, especially during the second and third trimesters, due to potential fetal harm.
