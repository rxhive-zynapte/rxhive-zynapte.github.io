## **Usage**

Cinnarizine + Domperidone is prescribed for the management of vertigo, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting associated with various conditions, including Meniere's disease, labyrinthitis, motion sickness, and migraine.  It is also used to alleviate symptoms of nausea and fullness related to dyspepsia and gastritis.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This combination drug falls into two categories:

* **Cinnarizine:** Antihistamine, Calcium channel blocker
* **Domperidone:** Antiemetic, Dopamine antagonist, Prokinetic agent

**Mechanism of Action:** Cinnarizine reduces the excitability of the vestibular system in the inner ear by blocking calcium channels and also acts as an antihistamine. Domperidone is a dopamine antagonist that acts on the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the brain and the upper digestive tract, thus reducing nausea and vomiting. It also increases the movements and contractions of stomach muscles and acts as a prokinetic agent, facilitating gastric emptying and controlling acid reflux.

## **Alternate Names**

No internationally recognized alternate names exist for the combination product itself.  The individual components, however, may be known by other names (primarily related to specific salt forms).

**Brand Names:**  Cinnarizine + Domperidone is marketed under various brand names, some examples include: Atmozin-D, Cindom, and others. (Note: Brand availability may vary by region).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cinnarizine acts by blocking calcium channels in the inner ear and peripheral blood vessels, stabilizing vestibular function and improving microcirculation. As an antihistamine, it reduces the effects of histamine, a chemical messenger involved in allergic reactions and motion sickness symptoms.  Domperidone blocks the action of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that stimulates the vomiting center in the brain. This action prevents nausea and vomiting. Its prokinetic effect enhances gastric motility and emptying, relieving fullness and discomfort.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Both drugs are absorbed orally. Domperidone absorption can be slightly delayed if taken after meals.
* **Metabolism:**  Cinnarizine is metabolized in the liver by CYP enzymes. Domperidone is also primarily metabolized in the liver, specifically by CYP3A4.
* **Elimination:** Both drugs are primarily excreted through urine and feces.

**Mode of Action:** Cinnarizine affects vestibular function by reducing calcium influx into cells, leading to decreased sensitivity of the balance organs.  It also antagonizes H1 histamine receptors. Domperidone exerts its antiemetic effect by antagonizing dopamine D2 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and the gastrointestinal tract. It enhances gastrointestinal motility by blocking dopamine receptors in the gut.

**Elimination Pathways:** Cinnarizine is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted mainly in urine and feces. Domperidone is metabolized in the liver, involving CYP3A4 enzymes and excreted primarily in urine and to a lesser extent in feces.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The typical adult dose is one tablet containing 20mg of cinnarizine and 15mg of domperidone, taken two to three times a day. The maximum dose is typically three tablets per day.

#### **Children:**  Use with caution in children. Domperidone is not recommended in children weighing less than 35kg.  Doses for eligible children must be carefully calculated based on body weight (0.25mg/kg up to three times per day) and administered with a device that allows for accurate measurement. Tablets are unsuitable for use in these cases; liquid formulations are necessary.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment might be required. Start with a lower dose and monitor for side effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution and potential dose reduction are necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in moderate to severe hepatic impairment. Caution is required in mild hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful evaluation of cardiovascular status is necessary, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The primary use cases for Cinnarizine + Domperidone are focused on the management of vertigo, nausea, and vomiting, and not typically employed in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU. In emergency situations requiring management of nausea and vomiting, other agents may be more appropriate.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are essential in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, as well as in elderly patients. It is crucial to consider drug interactions when determining the appropriate dosage.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Drowsiness, dry mouth, headache, gastrointestinal discomfort (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain), fatigue, weight gain, and indigestion are common side effects.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Extrapyramidal symptoms (especially with high doses of domperidone), cardiac arrhythmias (QT prolongation), and allergic reactions are rare but serious side effects.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

The potential long-term effects of this combination are not fully established.  However, prolonged use of domperidone has been associated with an increased risk of cardiac events.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Significant ADRs include cardiac arrhythmias, extrapyramidal reactions, and hypersensitivity reactions. These require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

Contraindications include hypersensitivity to either component, gastrointestinal bleeding or obstruction, prolactinoma, pheochromocytoma,  moderate to severe hepatic impairment, and concomitant use of drugs that prolong the QT interval or strongly inhibit CYP3A4.

## **Drug Interactions**

Cinnarizine + Domperidone can interact with various medications including:

* **CNS Depressants:** Alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids (increased sedation)
* **Anticholinergic Agents:** Atropine, scopolamine (additive anticholinergic effects)
* **Dopamine Agonists:** Levodopa, bromocriptine (reduced efficacy of domperidone)
* **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** Ketoconazole, erythromycin (increased domperidone levels)
* **QT Prolonging Drugs:** Amiodarone, haloperidol (increased risk of arrhythmias)

Interactions with food and lifestyle factors, such as alcohol and grapefruit juice (CYP3A4 inhibitor), should be considered.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Cinnarizine + Domperidone should be used with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and only if clearly necessary under strict medical supervision.  Fetal risks and drug excretion in breast milk are potential concerns. Consult a doctor for potential safer alternatives.
