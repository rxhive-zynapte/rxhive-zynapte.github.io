## **Usage**

Ciprofloxacin + Dexamethasone otic suspension is prescribed for the treatment of specific ear infections:

* **Acute Otitis Externa (AOE):**  Commonly known as swimmer's ear, this is a bacterial infection of the outer ear canal.  This medication is indicated for AOE in pediatric patients (6 months and older), adults, and the elderly due to susceptible strains of *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*.

* **Acute Otitis Media (AOM) with Tympanostomy Tubes:** This is a bacterial infection of the middle ear in pediatric patients (6 months and older) who have tympanostomy tubes (ear tubes) in place.  The medication is indicated for AOM due to *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*, *Moraxella catarrhalis*, and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Ciprofloxacin: Fluoroquinolone antibiotic
* Dexamethasone: Corticosteroid

**Mechanism of Action:**  Ciprofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair, leading to bacterial cell death. Dexamethasone provides anti-inflammatory and antipruritic effects by suppressing the immune response and reducing inflammation in the ear.

## **Alternate Names**

Ciprofloxacin/Dexamethasone, Ciprofloxacin and Dexamethasone otic suspension.

**Brand Names:** Ciprodex, CiloXadex, Dexaflox (Eye & Ear Drops).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ciprofloxacin exerts bactericidal action by inhibiting bacterial DNA replication. Dexamethasone reduces inflammation, edema, and pruritus in the ear.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  When administered otically, systemic absorption of both drugs is minimal.

**Mode of Action:** Ciprofloxacin targets bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, disrupting DNA replication. Dexamethasone binds to glucocorticoid receptors, modulating gene expression and inhibiting inflammatory mediators.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for ciprofloxacin. Hepatic metabolism for dexamethasone, with metabolites excreted in urine and bile.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults and Children (6 months and older) for AOE:**

* Four drops instilled into the affected ear twice daily (every 12 hours) for 7 days.


#### **Children (6 months and older) for AOM with Tympanostomy Tubes:**

* Four drops instilled into the affected ear twice daily (every 12 hours) for 7 days.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Children under 6 months:** Safety and efficacy not established, use not recommended.
* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments, but monitor for potential adverse effects like tendon rupture.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustments needed due to minimal systemic absorption.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments needed due to minimal systemic absorption.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to quinolones or corticosteroids.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication is specifically indicated for AOE and AOM with tympanostomy tubes.  Its use in other clinical settings (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, emergency situations) is not established and not recommended.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are generally not necessary due to the low systemic absorption following otic administration.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
* Ear discomfort, pain, or itching
* Unusual taste in the mouth

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Worsening ear pain or drainage

### **Long-Term Effects:**
* Potential for fungal superinfection with prolonged use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
* Hypersensitivity reactions

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to ciprofloxacin, dexamethasone, other quinolones, or any component of the formulation.
* Viral infections of the external ear canal (e.g., herpes simplex, varicella).
* Fungal infections of the ear.


## **Drug Interactions**

No clinically significant drug interactions are expected due to minimal systemic absorption.  However, concurrent use of other otic preparations should be avoided unless directed by a physician.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  FDA Pregnancy Category C. Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. Data on use in pregnant women are limited. Minimal systemic absorption expected.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Excretion in human milk unknown. Due to minimal systemic absorption, clinically significant exposure to the infant is unlikely. However, use with caution and consider the benefits of breastfeeding alongside potential risks.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Ciprofloxacin: Inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Dexamethasone: Suppresses inflammation.
* **Side Effects:** Ear discomfort, itching, unusual taste, allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, viral/fungal ear infections.
* **Drug Interactions:** None clinically significant expected.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution. Minimal systemic absorption.
* **Dosage:** 4 drops in affected ear twice daily for 7 days.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Resolution of ear infection symptoms.


## **Popular Combinations**

Not applicable. This medication is a fixed-dose combination.  


## **Precautions**

* Ensure the tympanic membrane is intact before administration for otitis externa.
* Avoid contact of the dropper tip with any surface to prevent contamination.
* Keep the affected ear(s) clean and dry during treatment.
* Avoid swimming unless directed by a physician.
* Discontinue use and consult a physician if symptoms worsen or if a skin rash develops.
