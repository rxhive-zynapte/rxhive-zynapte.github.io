## **Usage**

Ciprofloxacin + Metronidazole is a combination antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections, especially those involving both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. It's commonly prescribed for intra-abdominal infections (e.g., peritonitis, appendicitis, diverticulitis), pelvic inflammatory disease, and certain skin and soft tissue infections.  It is also used for surgical prophylaxis in intestinal or genitourinary tract surgeries. This combination is particularly useful in cases of perianal fistulas related to Crohn's disease.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic (fluoroquinolone + nitroimidazole)

**Mechanism of Action:** Ciprofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair. Metronidazole disrupts bacterial DNA structure and function by forming reactive metabolites within anaerobic bacterial cells.


## **Alternate Names**
There is no officially recognized alternate name for the combination, but it may be referred to as "Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole". Brand names may vary depending on the location.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ciprofloxacin primarily targets aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while metronidazole effectively eliminates anaerobic bacteria and certain protozoa. The combined effect provides broad-spectrum coverage against many types of bacteria in mixed infections.

**Pharmacokinetics:** 
* **Ciprofloxacin:** Well-absorbed orally, reaching peak serum levels within 1-2 hours. Metabolized in the liver and excreted mainly through the kidneys. The half life is approximately 4-5 hours. Elimination may be reduced in patients with impaired renal function.
* **Metronidazole:** Absorbed readily following oral administration with a half-life of about 8 hours.  Metabolized in the liver and mostly excreted renally. Dose adjustments are not usually needed in patients with renal dysfunction, although drug accumulation can occur in end-stage renal disease.

**Mode of Action:**  See "Mechanism of Action" above

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Ciprofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Metronidazole's metabolites directly damage bacterial DNA, ultimately causing bacterial cell death.  

**Elimination Pathways:** Ciprofloxacin is eliminated primarily renally with some hepatic metabolism. Metronidazole is also excreted mostly via the kidneys following hepatic metabolism.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Oral: Ciprofloxacin 500-750 mg every 12 hours + Metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours or 1g every 12 hours.
Intravenous: Ciprofloxacin 400 mg every 12 hours + Metronidazole 500mg every 6 hours or 1g every 12 hours. The dosage and duration depend on the severity and site of infection.

#### **Children:**

Dosage must be determined by a doctor based on weight and age. For appendicitis, the IV dosage is Ciprofloxacin 10 mg/kg every 8 hours (max 400 mg/dose, 1200 mg/day) + Metronidazole 7.5 mg/kg every 6 hours or 10 mg/kg every 8 hours (max 2000 mg/day). Oral dosage upon discharge is Ciprofloxacin 20 mg/kg twice daily (max 750 mg/dose, 1500 mg/day) + Metronidazole 7.5 mg/kg four times a day (max 500 mg/dose).


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment may be needed based on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Ciprofloxacin requires dose reduction based on creatinine clearance, whereas metronidazole usually does not need adjustment except in severe renal failure.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution advised, and monitor for signs of liver dysfunction.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider adjustments for conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and epilepsy.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage guidelines in these settings are similar to standard dosage and depend on the type and severity of infection:

* **Intubation**
* **Surgical Procedures** (prophylaxis)
* **Mechanical Ventilation**
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
* **Emergency Situations**

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modification is required for patients with renal impairment, especially for Ciprofloxacin. Individualized dosing is essential based on the specific infection and patient factors.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, metallic taste.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

QT prolongation, torsades de pointes (rare), peripheral neuropathy (with prolonged metronidazole use), tendonitis or tendon rupture (ciprofloxacin), seizures, severe allergic reactions, *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Peripheral neuropathy (metronidazole), cartilage damage in growing children (ciprofloxacin).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any sign of allergic reaction, cardiac arrhythmias, signs of neurotoxicity (peripheral neuropathy, seizures).


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to ciprofloxacin or metronidazole, history of seizures (especially with ciprofloxacin), myasthenia gravis, concomitant use of tizanidine, concurrent alcohol consumption (metronidazole), Cockayne syndrome.


## **Drug Interactions**

Tizanidine (contraindicated), warfarin (enhanced anticoagulant effect), phenytoin, phenobarbital, alcohol (disulfiram-like reaction with metronidazole), antacids (reduced ciprofloxacin absorption), theophylline, caffeine, cyclosporine.  Metronidazole may increase QT prolongation risk with other drugs also prolonging the QT interval (e.g., certain antipsychotics, antifungals, and other antibiotics).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy:** Metronidazole is generally considered safe. Ciprofloxacin should be avoided, especially in the first trimester.

**Breastfeeding:**  Although both can pass into breast milk, small amounts of ciprofloxacin may be acceptable if the benefits outweigh risks. Metronidazole is generally avoided during breastfeeding due to potential side effects in newborns. Monitor the baby for diarrhea, thrush, and rash. An interruption in breastfeeding can be considered in both medications.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

(Please refer to previous sections for detailed information.)


## **Popular Combinations**

Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole are often combined, particularly for intra-abdominal, pelvic, skin, and soft tissue infections. 


## **Precautions**

Assess renal and hepatic function before and during therapy. Monitor for signs of neurotoxicity, tendonitis/tendon rupture, cardiac arrhythmias, and *C. difficile* infection. Screen for allergies to fluoroquinolones or nitroimidazoles. Counsel patients to avoid alcohol during metronidazole therapy and for at least 72 hours after the last dose.  Ciprofloxacin can increase sun sensitivity, so patients should take precautions against excessive sun exposure.
