## **Usage**

Ciprofloxacin + Ornidazole is a combination antibiotic used to treat bacterial and parasitic infections. It combines a fluoroquinolone antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) with a nitroimidazole antibiotic (ornidazole). This combination is particularly effective against mixed infections where both bacteria and anaerobic organisms or parasites (like amoeba) are involved. It is commonly prescribed for:

*   Infectious diarrhea
*   Amoebiasis (infection with amoeba)
*   Giardiasis (infection with Giardia lamblia)
*   Vaginal infections (bacterial or parasitic)
*   Intra-abdominal infections
*   Pelvic inflammatory disease
*   Dental infections
*   Post-surgical infections
*   Certain urinary tract infections
*   Typhoid fever

**Pharmacological Classification:**

*   Ciprofloxacin: Fluoroquinolone antibiotic
*   Ornidazole: Nitroimidazole antibiotic (antiprotozoal, antibacterial against anaerobes)

**Mechanism of Action:**

Ciprofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair, thus leading to bacterial cell death.  Ornidazole is metabolized within the bacterial/parasitic cell to reactive intermediates, which damage DNA and cause cell death. The two antibiotics have different mechanisms, providing a broad spectrum of coverage.

## **Alternate Names**

There isn't a single official international non-proprietary name (INN) for the combination, but it is often referred to simply as "ciprofloxacin and ornidazole." Brand names vary by region. Some examples include:

*   Ciplox-OZ
*   Cifran OZ
*   Orcipyx
*   Cipromac OZ


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

Ciprofloxacin exerts bactericidal effects primarily by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Ornidazole has bactericidal and antiprotozoal activity, targeting anaerobic bacteria and some parasites.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Both drugs are well-absorbed orally. Food may slightly delay but not reduce the absorption of ciprofloxacin. Milk and dairy products can decrease absorption of ciprofloxacin significantly.
*   **Metabolism:** Ciprofloxacin is minimally metabolized. Ornidazole is metabolized in the liver, primarily by oxidation and glucuronidation.
*   **Elimination:** Ciprofloxacin is primarily excreted renally (through kidneys). Ornidazole is excreted in urine and feces, with renal excretion being the major route.

**Mode of Action:**

Ciprofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, essential for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination. Ornidazole's metabolites interact with microbial DNA, forming adducts and causing strand breakage, leading to cell death.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**

*   Ciprofloxacin targets DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.
*   Ornidazole: intracellular reduction in anaerobic organisms generates reactive metabolites.

**Elimination Pathways:**

*   Ciprofloxacin: Primarily renal excretion.
*   Ornidazole: Renal and hepatic excretion.


## **Dosage**

**Standard Dosage**

**Adults:** Usual dose is 500 mg of ciprofloxacin and 500 mg of ornidazole every 12 hours, usually for 5 to 10 days depending on the infection.  

**Children:** Use is generally avoided in children under 18.  In certain serious infections where benefits outweigh risks, it can be prescribed under specialist supervision.  Dosage calculations are based on weight, but information on exact pediatric dosing is not included in the provided sources.


**Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be needed based on renal function.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  The dose should be reduced according to creatinine clearance.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Usually, no dose adjustment is required for ornidazole, but caution is advised. Dose adjustments for ciprofloxacin may be necessary in severe cases.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is warranted in patients with a history of seizures, myasthenia gravis, and QT interval prolongation.


**Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing for specific clinical situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use needs to be determined based on the specific infection and the patient's status, which is not detailed in the provided sources. Dosages provided in the sources refer to general indications only and should be confirmed with a qualified doctor.


**Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modification may be required in renal impairment, severe hepatic dysfunction, or in patients with certain comorbid conditions. Specific recommendations are provided in the 'Special Cases' section.
