      How does Cisapride work to alleviate GERD symptoms?**


      **A:** Cisapride works by increasing acetylcholine release in the
      myenteric plexus, stimulating gastrointestinal motility and helping to
      move food through the digestive system more efficiently, reducing reflux.

## **Usage**

- Cisapride + Methylpolysiloxane is prescribed for the relief of symptoms related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), such as heartburn, acid reflux, bloating, and abdominal discomfort.  It is sometimes used to treat constipation.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Gastroprokinetic (Cisapride) and antiflatulent (Methylpolysiloxane).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Cisapride increases acetylcholine release in the myenteric plexus of the gastrointestinal tract, stimulating gut motility. Methylpolysiloxane works by reducing the surface tension of gas bubbles, allowing them to combine and be expelled more easily.

## **Alternate Names**

- Various brand names exist, including Cisa MPS, Mogit MPS, Syspride MPS, Gastropen MPS, and Ezamps, depending on the region and manufacturer.  Cisapride is often unavailable due to safety concerns and is subject to restrictions in many places.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Cisapride enhances gastrointestinal motility by increasing the release of acetylcholine.  Methylpolysiloxane reduces gas formation in the digestive tract.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Cisapride is metabolized by the liver, mainly via the CYP3A4 enzyme system.  Methylpolysiloxane is not systemically absorbed.
- **Mode of Action:** Cisapride acts on the myenteric plexus to facilitate acetylcholine release. Methylpolysiloxane works physically by decreasing the surface tension of gas bubbles.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Cisapride is primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism, while methylpolysiloxane is expelled from the body through the digestive tract.

## **Dosage**

Due to safety concerns related to Cisapride, its availability is restricted, making the following dosage information primarily of historical relevance:

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Historically, 5-10 mg orally every 6 hours, taken 15 minutes before meals and at bedtime. Dosages could be increased to 20 mg in some cases. Methylpolysiloxane dosage depends on the specific formulation.

#### **Children:**

- Historical pediatric dosing: 0.15-0.3 mg/kg/dose orally every 6-8 hours, not exceeding 10 mg/dose. Pediatric usage is discouraged due to safety risks.

#### **Special Cases:**

Due to the restricted nature of Cisapride, dosing recommendations for the following special cases are not readily available:

- **Elderly Patients:** Requires careful consideration due to potential age-related changes in organ function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose modifications are necessary, depending on the severity of renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Careful use and possible dose adjustments are crucial because the liver metabolizes Cisapride.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments and careful use may be necessary.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing guidelines for specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, or ICU usage are not readily available, especially given the limited availability and safety concerns surrounding Cisapride.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments for renal/hepatic impairment, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms should be individualized based on the patient's specific factors.  Cisapride requires very careful consideration in these situations.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Diarrhea
- Nausea
- Headache
- Abdominal cramps
- Constipation
- Rhinitis
- Increased incidence of viral infections

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Data on the long-term effects of this drug combination are limited, particularly given the restricted usage of Cisapride.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Serious cardiac arrhythmias (as noted above) constitute clinically significant ADRs requiring immediate medical intervention.

## **Contraindications**
