## **Usage**

This combination of ingredients is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to support overall health and address specific deficiencies. It is often prescribed for male infertility, asthenozoospermia (reduced sperm motility), and oligospermia (low sperm count).  It is not classified as a drug, but rather a nutritional supplement and therefore doesn't have a specific pharmacological classification. The components work synergistically to support various bodily functions related to energy production, antioxidant protection, and sperm health.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination does not have a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN). It is typically identified by its component ingredients. Brand names may vary regionally; Maxoza is one example.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The components of this supplement exert their effects through various mechanisms:

* **Coenzyme Q10:**  Acts as an antioxidant and participates in mitochondrial electron transport chain, crucial for cellular energy production.
* **Levo-carnitine:** Facilitates the transport of fatty acids into mitochondria for energy production and may improve sperm motility.
* **Lycopene:** A potent antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative stress.
* **Selenium:**  Essential for selenoprotein synthesis, contributing to antioxidant defense and thyroid hormone metabolism.
* **Zinc:**  Plays a role in immune function, cell division, and protein synthesis.  It's crucial for male reproductive health.
* **Folic Acid:**  Important for DNA synthesis and cell division, particularly during periods of rapid growth like spermatogenesis.
* **Methylcobalamin:**  A form of Vitamin B12 involved in nerve function and red blood cell production.
* **Fructo-oligosaccharides:**  Act as prebiotics, supporting the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.
* **Citric Acid:**  Contributes to energy production through the Krebs cycle.


**Pharmacokinetics:** The absorption, metabolism, and elimination of each component vary:

* **Coenzyme Q10:** Absorbed with lipids, metabolized in the liver, and excreted in bile.
* **Levo-carnitine:** Absorbed in the small intestine, minimal hepatic metabolism, renal excretion.
* **Lycopene:**  Absorbed with lipids, undergoes isomerization and metabolism in the liver, primarily excreted in bile and feces.
* **Selenium:**  Absorbed from the small intestine, converted to selenoproteins, excreted in urine and feces.
* **Zinc:**  Absorbed in the small intestine, bound to proteins, excreted mainly in feces.
* **Folic Acid:** Absorbed from the small intestine, metabolized in the liver, excreted in urine and bile.
* **Methylcobalamin:** Absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, stored in the liver, and excreted in urine.
