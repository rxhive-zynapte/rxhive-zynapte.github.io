## **Usage**

This combination of ingredients is primarily used as a dietary supplement to improve sperm parameters in men with idiopathic infertility.  It is not classified as a drug in the traditional sense (e.g., antibiotic, analgesic) but rather as a nutritional supplement.  Its mechanism of action involves providing nutritional support to enhance spermatogenesis and improve sperm quality.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no official alternate name for this specific combination. It is often referred to by brand names. One example mentioned in the sources is "Maxoza-L Powder."  Other similar formulations may exist with slight variations in composition or brand names, such as "EDLAR FORTE Sachet" and "Q LARQ FORT SACHET."

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** This combination exerts its effects through the synergistic action of its components.  L-carnitine facilitates fatty acid transport into mitochondria, promoting energy production for sperm motility.  Coenzyme Q10 acts as an antioxidant, protecting sperm from oxidative stress. Folic acid, methylcobalamin (vitamin B12), selenium, and zinc are essential for DNA synthesis, cell division, and sperm maturation. Fructo-oligosaccharides act as prebiotics, supporting gut health, which may indirectly impact fertility. Citric acid is included to enhance palatability.


**Pharmacokinetics:**  The individual components have varying pharmacokinetic profiles. L-carnitine is absorbed in the small intestine and distributed widely. Coenzyme Q10 is absorbed with lipids and undergoes hepatic metabolism. Folic acid is metabolized in the liver. Methylcobalamin is stored in the liver. Selenium is incorporated into selenoproteins. Zinc is absorbed and bound to plasma proteins. Fructo-oligosaccharides are fermented by gut bacteria. Citric acid is readily metabolized.  Elimination pathways also vary depending on the individual component (renal/hepatic).

**Mode of Action:**  The ingredients collectively support sperm production and function. CoQ10 protects against oxidative damage. L-carnitine supports energy production.  Folic acid, B12, zinc, and selenium participate in DNA synthesis and cell division.


## **Dosage**
