## **Usage**

Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine with anticholinergic and sedative properties, is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of allergic reactions (rhinitis, conjunctivitis, urticaria, angioedema), motion sickness, insomnia, and mild Parkinsonian symptoms. Citric acid is included in some formulations as a buffering agent. Diphenhydramine is categorized as an H1-receptor antagonist, an antihistamine.

Diphenhydramine competes with histamine for H1-receptor sites on effector cells, thus reducing the effects of histamine.  It also possesses anticholinergic properties, leading to drying effects.  Its sedative properties are attributed to its effect on the central nervous system.

## **Alternate Names**

Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride.

**Brand Names:** Benadryl, Sominex, Unisom SleepGels (and many others).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Diphenhydramine acts as an inverse agonist at the H1 histamine receptor, blocking the actions of histamine. Its anticholinergic effects result from competitive antagonism at muscarinic receptors.  The sedative effects are likely due to its antagonism of histamine H1 receptors in the brain and its anticholinergic properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Diphenhydramine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 1-4 hours.  It is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6, to inactive metabolites. Elimination occurs primarily via renal excretion.

**Mode of Action:** At the cellular level, diphenhydramine competes with histamine for binding at H1 receptors. This prevents histamine from binding and initiating its effects, such as vasodilation, increased capillary permeability, and smooth muscle contraction.  Its anticholinergic effects arise from blocking acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, leading to reduced glandular secretions and smooth muscle relaxation.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** H1 receptor inverse agonist, Muscarinic receptor antagonist.  May inhibit CYP2D6.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of metabolites.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Oral: 25-50 mg every 4-6 hours as needed.  Maximum daily dose: 300 mg.
IM/IV: 10-50 mg (up to 100 mg if necessary), not to exceed 25 mg/minute. Maximum daily dose: 400 mg.


#### **Children:**

Oral (over 20 lbs / 9 kg): 12.5-25 mg every 4-6 hours. Maximum daily dose: 300 mg or 5mg/kg/24 hours.
Alternative weight-based dosing: 5 mg/kg/24 hours, divided into 4 doses.  Do not exceed 300 mg/day.
Children 2-6 years: 6.25 mg every 4-6 hours as needed, maximum 37.5 mg/day.
Children 6-12 years: 12.5-25 mg every 4-6 hours as needed, maximum 150 mg/day.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses due to increased sensitivity to side effects (drowsiness, dizziness, confusion).
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution as diphenhydramine is metabolized in the liver.  Dose adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution in patients with glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, bladder neck obstruction, peptic ulcer disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Diphenhydramine is not typically used in the clinical settings mentioned (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations).  Other medications are generally preferred in these scenarios.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on renal/hepatic function, age, and concomitant medications.

## **Popular Combinations**

Diphenhydramine is often combined with other medications in over-the-counter products for cold and allergy symptoms (e.g., with analgesics like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, or decongestants like pseudoephedrine).


## **Precautions**

Avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants.  Use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, asthma, COPD, and glaucoma.  Caution in elderly patients due to increased sensitivity.  Avoid driving or operating machinery until effects are known.
