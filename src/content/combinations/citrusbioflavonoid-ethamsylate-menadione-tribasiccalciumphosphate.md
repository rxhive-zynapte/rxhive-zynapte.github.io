## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for managing and reducing excessive bleeding, particularly in conditions like heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) and bleeding after surgical procedures. It aids in normal blood clotting, thus supporting the natural healing process.

**Pharmacological Classifications:**

* **Ethamsylate:** Hemostatic agent
* **Menadione (Vitamin K3):** Vitamin, essential for blood clotting
* **Citrus Bioflavonoids:** Antioxidant, vascular protectant
* **Tribasic Calcium Phosphate:** Calcium and phosphate supplement, also contributes to clotting

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination works via multiple pathways: Ethamsylate enhances platelet adhesion and increases capillary resistance. Menadione is crucial for synthesizing clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. Citrus Bioflavonoids improve vascular integrity and have antioxidant properties, while Tribasic Calcium Phosphate provides calcium necessary for the clotting cascade.


## **Alternate Names**

* Hemsyl Cvp
* Pause-XT
* Tenxima XT Stop

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ethamsylate promotes platelet adhesion and capillary resistance, reducing bleeding time. Menadione, a synthetic form of Vitamin K, is essential for hepatic synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X.  Citrus bioflavonoids act as antioxidants and may contribute to vascular wall stability. Calcium is vital for the clotting cascade.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The absorption, metabolism, and elimination of this specific combination have not been extensively studied. Ethamsylate is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Menadione is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and metabolized in the liver. Citrus bioflavonoids have variable absorption and metabolism. Calcium phosphate absorption occurs in the small intestine, facilitated by Vitamin D. It is primarily excreted through the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:**  Ethamsylate acts by increasing platelet adhesiveness and improving capillary resistance, shortening bleeding time. Menadione is a cofactor in the post-translational carboxylation of glutamic acid residues in clotting factors, essential for their activity. Citrus bioflavonoids exhibit antioxidant effects, scavenging free radicals and potentially enhancing vascular integrity. Calcium ions are required for various steps in the coagulation cascade. Specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation by this combination is not well-defined.

**Elimination Pathways:** Ethamsylate is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Menadione is metabolized in the liver and excreted in bile and urine. Citrus bioflavonoids undergo variable metabolism and excretion. Calcium phosphate is excreted mainly through the kidneys.


## **Dosage**

Dosage information for this specific combination product is limited and often varies by brand name. It is essential to consult the specific product packaging or a healthcare professional for precise guidance. The following information is based on available data and should be verified for the particular brand prescribed.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Dosage recommendations vary. Some sources suggest one tablet two to three times a day, while others recommend 500mg of ethamsylate up to four times a day during menstruation for menorrhagia, or 250-500mg every four to six hours post-surgery to manage hemorrhage.  Always adhere to the prescribed dosage.

#### **Children:**

The safety and efficacy in children, particularly premenarcheal girls, have not been established. Use with extreme caution in adolescents under 18, under strict medical supervision.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Not recommended for postmenopausal women. Geriatric use should be carefully assessed, with dosage adjustments as needed.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dosage adjustments may be required due to the increased risk of hypercalcemia.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary in severe liver disease due to menadione's hepatic metabolism. Closely monitor liver function tests.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration is needed for patients with thromboembolic disorders, hypercalcemia, or nephrolithiasis.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Specific dosage recommendations for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not explicitly defined for this combination. Dosing is determined on a case-by-case basis, considering the specific clinical scenario and patient factors. Consult a specialist for individualized recommendations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage modifications are necessary based on patient-specific factors, including renal or hepatic dysfunction, age, and coexisting medical conditions. Close monitoring of calcium levels and coagulation parameters is advisable.
