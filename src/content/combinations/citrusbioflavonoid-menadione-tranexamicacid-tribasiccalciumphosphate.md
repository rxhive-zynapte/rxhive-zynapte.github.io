## **Usage**

- This combination drug is primarily prescribed for managing heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia). It may also be used to control excessive bleeding post-surgery.
- **Pharmacological classification**:  Antifibrinolytic, Hemostatic agent.  Citrus bioflavonoids and calcium phosphate contribute to overall blood and bone health, menadione supports blood clotting, and tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic.
- **Mechanism of action**: This combination works synergistically to reduce bleeding. Tranexamic acid inhibits the breakdown of blood clots.  Calcium phosphate provides calcium, which is crucial for blood clotting. Citrus bioflavonoids help maintain blood vessel integrity.  Menadione (vitamin K3) is vital for synthesizing clotting factors.

## **Alternate Names**

While there isn't a universally recognized international non-proprietary name (INN) for this specific combination, the components have individual INNs as mentioned above.

- **Brand names**: Pause-XT, Stalia-Plus, Tenxima XT Stop, Hemsyl Cvp (and others)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Tranexamic acid inhibits plasminogen activation, reducing fibrinolysis and stabilizing clots.  Calcium supports the clotting cascade. Citrus bioflavonoids improve capillary integrity. Menadione, a fat-soluble vitamin, is essential for synthesizing clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X in the liver.
- **Pharmacokinetics**:
    - **Tranexamic Acid**: Well-absorbed orally. Primarily excreted renally.
    - **Citrus Bioflavonoids**: Absorption and metabolism can vary.
    - **Menadione**: Absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Metabolized in the liver. Excreted in urine and bile.
    - **Tribasic Calcium Phosphate**: Absorption is influenced by vitamin D and other factors. Calcium is primarily excreted in urine.
- **Mode of Action**: Tranexamic acid acts by reversibly binding to plasminogen, preventing the formation of plasmin, an enzyme that breaks down fibrin in clots. Menadione acts as a cofactor for gamma-glutamyl carboxylase, an enzyme needed to form active blood clotting factors.
- **Elimination pathways**:  Tranexamic acid and calcium are predominantly excreted renally. Menadione and its metabolites are excreted in bile and urine. Citrus bioflavonoids have variable excretion pathways.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults**:  One tablet two to three times a day, preferably with food. This can vary between brands.  The duration of treatment depends on the indication.

#### **Children**:  Not generally recommended for premenarcheal girls. Use cautiously in adolescent females below 18 years, with dosage adjusted based on the child's weight and the specific condition.

#### **Special Cases**:

- **Elderly Patients**: No specific dosage adjustment is usually necessary, but careful monitoring is recommended due to the potential for age-related decline in renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Dose adjustment may be required, especially with tranexamic acid, which is primarily renally cleared. Consult current guidelines.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Caution advised, particularly with menadione due to its hepatic metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Patients with bleeding disorders, clotting disorders, or history of thromboembolic events should be monitored carefully.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Specific dosage guidelines for clinical use cases such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations for this combination drug haven't been found as of the current date (2025-02-16).

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary for renal and hepatic impairment. Consider individual patient factors, concomitant medications, and clinical response for optimal dosing.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Headache, stomach pain, nasal congestion, sinus pain, sinus inflammation, rash, tiredness, musculoskeletal pain, anemia, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions, thromboembolic events (blood clots), elevated calcium levels.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term effects haven't been extensively studied for this combination drug, especially given its typical use in managing acute conditions.  However, long-term use of tranexamic acid may increase the risk of thromboembolic events in susceptible individuals.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, visual disturbances, seizures (rare).




## **Contraindications**

Active or history of thromboembolic disease (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism), known allergy to any component, intracranial bleeding, severe renal impairment, defective color vision (for monitoring toxicity), active bleeding or clotting disorders, Subarachnoid hemorrhage, Thrombogenic valvular disease, thrombogenic cardiac rhythm disease, or hypercoagulopathy. Pregnancy.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Hormonal contraceptives: May increase the risk of thrombosis.
- Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin): May reduce the efficacy of tranexamic acid.
- Thrombolytic agents (e.g., streptokinase): Counteract the effects of tranexamic acid.
- Certain chemotherapy drugs (e.g., cyclophosphamide): May increase calcium release from cells. Alcohol should be avoided.




## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy**: This combination is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of clotting complications and limited safety data.
- **Breastfeeding**: Caution advised, as tranexamic acid may be present in breast milk.

- **Side Effects**: See above.
- **Contraindications**: See above.
- **Drug Interactions**: See above.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding**: Contraindicated in pregnancy, caution advised during breastfeeding.
