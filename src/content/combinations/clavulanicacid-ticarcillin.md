## **Usage**

- Clavulanic acid + ticarcillin is prescribed for a variety of bacterial infections, including lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, bone and joint infections, skin and soft tissue infections, gynecological infections, and infections caused by *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Stenotrophomonas maltophilia*.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Beta-lactam antibiotic combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor.
- **Mechanism of action:** Ticarcillin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), leading to bacterial cell death.  Clavulanic acid, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, protects ticarcillin from degradation by beta-lactamase enzymes produced by some bacteria, thus extending ticarcillin's antibacterial spectrum.

## **Alternate Names**

- Co-ticarclav
- **Brand Names:** Timentin

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ticarcillin exerts bactericidal activity by disrupting bacterial cell wall synthesis. Clavulanic acid itself has little antibacterial activity but enhances the effect of ticarcillin by inhibiting beta-lactamases.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Administered intravenously or intramuscularly.  Ticarcillin is well distributed in body tissues and fluids. It crosses the placenta and enters breast milk in small amounts. Primarily eliminated unchanged by the kidneys. Clavulanic acid is also well distributed and undergoes significant hepatic metabolism.  Both components achieve peak plasma concentrations immediately after a 30-minute infusion.
- **Mode of action:**  Ticarcillin binds to PBPs, specifically inhibiting transpeptidases and carboxypeptidases involved in peptidoglycan synthesis, a crucial component of the bacterial cell wall.
- **Receptor binding/enzyme inhibition:**  Ticarcillin inhibits PBPs. Clavulanic acid inhibits beta-lactamase enzymes.
- **Elimination pathways:**  Ticarcillin is primarily excreted renally. Clavulanic acid is significantly metabolized by the liver, with some renal excretion.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 3.1 grams (containing 3 grams ticarcillin and 100 mg clavulanic acid) every 4 to 6 hours intravenously.  Maximum dose: 18 g/day.

#### **Children (â‰¥ 3 months):**

- 200-300 mg ticarcillin/kg/day IV divided every 4-6 hours.
- Neonates (0-28 days): refer to specialized neonatal dosing guidelines.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustment generally not required unless renal function is impaired.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are necessary based on creatinine clearance.  A loading dose of 3.1 grams is typically followed by adjusted maintenance doses.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary with concomitant renal impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Individualized dosing may be required based on specific comorbidity.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing recommendations for specific clinical situations often follow the standard adult or pediatric dosages, adjusted as needed based on severity of infection and renal function.  Consultation with an infectious disease specialist is recommended in complex cases.

- **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use/Emergency Situations:**  Standard or adjusted dosages are typically used based on the infection's severity and the patient's condition.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are crucial for patients with renal impairment and should be based on creatinine clearance.  Consult specific guidelines for detailed recommendations and adjustments based on dialysis modality.


## **Side Effects**
