## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the treatment of mixed vaginal infections, including:

*   **Bacterial vaginosis:** An overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria in the vagina.
*   **Vulvovaginal candidiasis (Yeast infection):** Caused by the fungus *Candida albicans*.
*   **Trichomoniasis:** A sexually transmitted infection caused by the parasite *Trichomonas vaginalis*.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This is a fixed-dose combination (FDC) product containing:

*   Clindamycin: Lincosamide antibiotic
*   Clotrimazole: Azole antifungal
*   Metronidazole: Nitroimidazole antibiotic with antiprotozoal activity
*   Lactobacillus sporogenes: Probiotic

**Mechanism of Action:**

*   **Clindamycin:** Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. Primarily bacteriostatic, but can be bactericidal against some susceptible organisms.
*   **Clotrimazole:** Inhibits ergosterol synthesis, a crucial component of fungal cell membranes. This disruption leads to fungal cell death.
*   **Metronidazole:** Disrupts DNA synthesis and causes DNA strand breakage in susceptible anaerobic bacteria and protozoa.
*   **Lactobacillus sporogenes:** Contributes to restoring the normal vaginal flora, creating an environment less conducive to pathogenic growth.

## **Alternate Names**

Specific names vary based on the manufacturer and region. Some examples of brand names include:

*   Clid VL
*   Cliza VL
*   Cloclinda-VT
*   CLINDAREX

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

The combined effect of the antibiotic, antifungal, and probiotic addresses the multiple etiologies of vaginal infections. Clindamycin and metronidazole target bacteria and some protozoa, while clotrimazole targets fungi.  Lactobacillus sporogenes supports a healthy vaginal environment.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Clindamycin:** Primarily administered intravaginally, with minimal systemic absorption.
*   **Clotrimazole:** Intravaginal administration limits systemic effects.
*   **Metronidazole:** When administered intravaginally, systemic absorption is low, although higher than clindamycin or clotrimazole.
*   **Lactobacillus sporogenes:** Acts locally within the vagina.

**Mode of Action (Cellular/Molecular Level):**  See "Mechanism of Action". Elimination pathways are primarily local for the intravaginal formulations.

## **Dosage**

**Standard Dosage:**

The standard dosage is one vaginal tablet/suppository/capsule/pessary inserted high into the vagina, preferably at bedtime, for a duration typically ranging from 3 to 7 days, as directed by the physician.  Specific regimens will depend on the brand and formulation.

**Children:**  This FDC is generally not indicated for pediatric use for vaginal infections.

**Special Cases:**

Consult product-specific information for precise guidance in these cases. As a general principle:

*   **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments based on age alone, though underlying health conditions should be considered.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use cautiously and adjust dosage as needed.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Exercise caution and consider dosage adjustment.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualize dosage based on the patient's overall health status and the specific comorbid conditions.

**Clinical Use Cases:**

This FDC is specifically formulated for vaginal infections and is not indicated for the use cases listed (intubation, surgical procedures, ICU).
