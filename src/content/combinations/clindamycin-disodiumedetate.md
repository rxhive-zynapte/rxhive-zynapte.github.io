## **Usage**

Clindamycin, an antibiotic belonging to the lincosamide class, is used to treat serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria (e.g., *Bacteroides*, *Peptostreptococcus*, *Clostridium*) and susceptible aerobic gram-positive bacteria like streptococci, staphylococci, and pneumococci.  Disodium edetate is included in the injectable formulation as a stabilizer. Clindamycin works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit.

## **Alternate Names**

Clindamycin phosphate.  
Brand Names: Dalacin C, Cleocin.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Clindamycin exerts its bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect by binding to the 50S subunit of bacterial ribosomes, thus inhibiting protein synthesis.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM).  IV administration provides rapid and complete bioavailability. IM administration results in rapid absorption, although peak concentrations are lower than with IV administration.
* **Distribution:**  Distributes widely in body tissues and fluids, including bone, but penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid is poor, even with inflamed meninges.  Crosses the placenta and is present in breast milk.
* **Metabolism:**  Primarily metabolized in the liver to active and inactive metabolites.
* **Elimination:** Excreted primarily in bile and feces, with a small amount eliminated in urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 2 to 3 hours but can be prolonged in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Serious Infections:** 600-1200 mg/day IV or IM divided into 2, 3, or 4 equal doses.
* **More Severe Infections:** 1200-2700 mg/day IV or IM divided into 2, 3, or 4 equal doses.  In life-threatening situations, doses up to 4800 mg/day IV have been given.  Single IM injections greater than 600 mg are not recommended, nor is administration of more than 1200 mg in a single one-hour IV infusion.


#### **Children (1 month to 16 years):**

* 20-40 mg/kg/day IV or IM divided into 3 or 4 equal doses. The higher doses are used for more severe infections.  Alternatively, pediatric patients may be dosed based on body surface area: 350 mg/m²/day for serious infections or 450 mg/m²/day for more severe infections.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments are generally not necessary unless renal or hepatic impairment is present. Consider other factors that may affect drug clearance.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustment is typically required, but careful monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution in severe hepatic impairment.  Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary depending on the specific comorbidity.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific clinical situations should be guided by the severity of the infection and patient factors.  Consult infectious disease specialists for recommendations in complex cases like those involving intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be necessary based on renal or hepatic function, other metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, injection site pain, thrombophlebitis.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*Pseudomembranous colitis* (severe, persistent, or bloody diarrhea), severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP)),  hepatotoxicity (jaundice).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic complications from prolonged use are rare, but *C. difficile* infection can recur.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Anaphylactic shock, severe skin reactions, severe colitis.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to clindamycin or lincomycin.  Prior history of *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea or pseudomembranous colitis.

## **Drug Interactions**

Neuromuscular blocking agents (e.g., pancuronium, vecuronium):  Clindamycin may enhance neuromuscular blockade.
CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin): May reduce clindamycin levels.
CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin): May increase clindamycin levels, although antagonism has also been demonstrated.
Vitamin K antagonists (e.g., warfarin): Increased coagulation tests (PT/INR) and/or bleeding have been reported.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy:**  Clindamycin crosses the placenta. Use during the first trimester is not recommended unless clearly needed.  Use during the second and third trimesters may be acceptable if the potential benefit outweighs the risk.  Injectable clindamycin contains benzyl alcohol, which is associated with "gasping syndrome" in premature infants.

**Breastfeeding:** Clindamycin is excreted in breast milk.  Infants should be monitored for diarrhea, candidiasis, or bloody stools. An alternate drug may be preferred.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit.
* **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, *C. difficile* infection.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to clindamycin or lincomycin, history of *C. difficile* infection.
* **Drug Interactions:** Neuromuscular blockers, CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors, vitamin K antagonists.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; risk of adverse events in infants.
* **Dosage:**  See dosage section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for signs of *C. difficile* infection, liver function tests (LFTs), renal function, and complete blood count (CBC) during prolonged therapy.

## **Popular Combinations**

Clindamycin is sometimes combined with other antibiotics like primaquine for *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia or with quinine for malaria.


## **Precautions**

Monitor for *C. difficile* infection.  Use with caution in patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease. Avoid in atopic individuals.
