## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the treatment of various inflammatory skin infections with bacterial and fungal components.  Conditions commonly treated include:

* Infected eczema or dermatitis
* Secondarily infected psoriasis
* Intertrigo (inflammation of skin folds)
* Infected contact dermatitis
* Ringworm infections with secondary bacterial infection

**Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product with components belonging to the following classes:

* **Clioquinol:** Antibacterial, Antifungal
* **Clobetasol:** Corticosteroid (topical)
* **Clotrimazole:** Antifungal (Imidazole)
* **Gentamicin:** Aminoglycoside Antibiotic
* **Tolnaftate:** Antifungal (Thiocarbamate)


**Mechanism of Action:** This combination targets multiple aspects of skin infections:

* **Clioquinol:** Disrupts bacterial and fungal cell processes, inhibiting their growth.
* **Clobetasol:** Suppresses the immune response, reducing inflammation, redness, and itching.
* **Clotrimazole:** Damages fungal cell walls, leading to cell death.
* **Gentamicin:** Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, hindering their growth and leading to their eradication.
* **Tolnaftate:** Disrupts fungal cell membrane permeability and inhibits squalene epoxidase, a crucial enzyme for fungal survival.


## **Alternate Names**

While this combination doesn't have a single, universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN), it's often identified by its components. Regional variations may exist.

**Brand Names:**  Various brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region, including Dermi 5, Ketolam K5, GETOCRAZ-5, Dermicraft 5C, and others.  It's important to check the composition of the specific brand for accurate information.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The combined effect of this medication results in a reduction of infection (bacterial and fungal), inflammation, and related symptoms like itching, redness, and swelling.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The medication is applied topically. Absorption is minimal under normal circumstances. Some systemic absorption might occur if applied to large areas, broken skin, or for extended periods.  Individual component pharmacokinetics:

* **Clobetasol:**  Metabolized in the liver and excreted through the kidneys.
* **Gentamicin:**  Minimally absorbed through intact skin. When absorbed systemically, it's excreted renally.
* **Clioquinol, Clotrimazole, Tolnaftate:**  Limited data on topical absorption and metabolism. Primarily metabolized hepatically.

**Mode of Action (Cellular/Molecular):** Already described under "Mechanism of Action" above.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**

* **Clobetasol:** Binds to glucocorticoid receptors.
* **Gentamicin:**  Inhibits bacterial ribosomes.
* **Tolnaftate:** Inhibits squalene epoxidase.
* **Clioquinol & Clotrimazole:** Interact with fungal cell membranes.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism followed by renal excretion for most components. Limited data available for topical application.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

Due to the potent nature of clobetasol and potential for toxicity with clioquinol, this combination is generally prescribed for short-term use and under strict medical supervision.  Dosage guidelines vary depending on the severity and location of the infection.

#### **Adults:**

A thin layer is typically applied to the affected area once or twice daily.  The duration of treatment is usually limited to a few weeks.  Always follow the physician's prescribed dosage and duration.


#### **Children:**

Use in children should be minimized due to higher risk of systemic absorption and potential adverse effects from clobetasol. Only use under strict medical supervision. Safety and efficacy in children have not been fully established.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use cautiously for limited durations due to increased risk of skin atrophy. Monitor closely for side effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary. Monitor renal function.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution and monitor liver function.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider underlying medical conditions and potential drug interactions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is intended for topical skin infections and isn't appropriate for systemic infections, surgical procedures, or life-threatening conditions.  It's not typically used in scenarios like intubation, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU.  For emergency situations, systemic therapy is preferred.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are made cautiously based on individual patient factors, including age, renal/hepatic function, and other medical conditions.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Burning
* Itching
* Irritation
* Redness
* Dryness at the application site
* Skin peeling


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Skin atrophy (thinning)
* Telangiectasia (spider veins)
* Hypopigmentation (skin lightening)
* Hypertrichosis (excess hair growth)
* Allergic contact dermatitis
* Cushing's syndrome (with prolonged or excessive use)

With Clioquinol specifically:

* Peripheral neuropathy (rare but serious)



### **Long-Term Effects:**
Prolonged or excessive use, especially of clobetasol, can lead to skin thinning, striae (stretch marks), and systemic absorption with associated adverse effects.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), though rare, require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any of the components
* Viral skin infections (e.g., herpes simplex, varicella)
* Rosacea
* Perioral dermatitis
* Extensive open wounds or burns (increased systemic absorption risk)


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Oral anticoagulants:** May increase bleeding risk.
* **Other topical corticosteroids:**  May potentiate adverse effects.
* **NSAIDs:** May increase risk of gastrointestinal side effects.
* **Systemic antifungals:** Potential for altered efficacy.

The safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established.  The use of this combination should be minimized and only when potential benefits outweigh risks to the fetus or nursing infant. Clioquinol is generally avoided during pregnancy. Clobetasol is classified as Pregnancy Category C. Consult a physician before use.
