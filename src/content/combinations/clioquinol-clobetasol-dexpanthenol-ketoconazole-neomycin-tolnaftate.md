## **Usage**

This combination cream is prescribed for inflammatory and pruritic dermatoses complicated by secondary bacterial and/or fungal infections.  Conditions this medication treats include:

*   Eczema
*   Psoriasis
*   Dermatitis (various types)
*   Athlete's foot (Tinea pedis)
*   Jock itch (Tinea cruris)
*   Ringworm (Tinea corporis)
*   Seborrheic dermatitis

**Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing:

*   Corticosteroid: Clobetasol propionate (anti-inflammatory, antipruritic)
*   Antifungals: Ketoconazole, Tolnaftate, Clioquinol (Iodochlorhydroxyquinoline)
*   Antibiotic: Neomycin
*   Emollient: Dexpanthenol

**Mechanism of Action:**  This cream combines multiple actions to address skin infections:

*   Clobetasol reduces inflammation and itching by suppressing the immune response.
*   Ketoconazole and Tolnaftate inhibit ergosterol synthesis, a critical part of fungal cell membranes, leading to fungal cell death.
*   Clioquinol has antifungal activity by affecting fungal DNA synthesis and some antibacterial action.
*   Neomycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, causing bacterial cell death.
*   Dexpanthenol enhances skin hydration and regeneration.

## **Alternate Names**

*   Dermi-Zio 6 Cream
*   CLOBAL GM Cream
*   Dermiford Cream
*   Various brand names depending on the manufacturer

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The combined ingredients work synergistically. The corticosteroid reduces inflammation and itching, while the antifungals and antibiotic target the microbial pathogens.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Topical application limits systemic absorption, although some absorption can occur with prolonged use or application to large areas, thin skin, or broken skin. Metabolism and excretion data for topical formulations of the combined components are not routinely assessed.

**Mode of Action:**

*   **Clobetasol:** Binds to glucocorticoid receptors, modulating gene expression and reducing inflammatory responses.
*   **Ketoconazole & Tolnaftate:** Inhibit fungal ergosterol synthesis.
*   **Clioquinol:** Interferes with fungal DNA synthesis and bacterial cell membrane function.
*   **Neomycin:** Binds to bacterial ribosomes, inhibiting protein synthesis.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily through topical clearance. Systemic absorption is limited, with any absorbed drug metabolized and excreted via renal or hepatic pathways.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer to the affected area twice daily. Do not exceed 50g per week. Treatment should not typically exceed two weeks.

#### **Children:** Use in children is not recommended unless under strict medical supervision.  Minimize treated area and duration of therapy.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to increased risk of skin thinning and systemic absorption.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution advised, especially with prolonged or large-area use. Monitor for systemic absorption signs.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution advised due to potential for altered metabolism.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate underlying conditions, especially diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination cream is primarily used for dermatological conditions in outpatient settings and isn't generally indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be needed based on individual patient factors, including condition severity, patient age, and response to treatment. 

## **Side Effects**
