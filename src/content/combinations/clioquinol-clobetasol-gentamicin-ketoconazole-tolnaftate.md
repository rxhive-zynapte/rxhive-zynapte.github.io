## **Usage**

This combination cream is prescribed for inflammatory skin infections with both bacterial and fungal components.  It is effective against a range of dermatological issues, including infected eczema, athlete's foot with secondary bacterial infections, and dermatitis complicated by fungal or bacterial growth.  It also aids in managing conditions like intertrigo and psoriasis with secondary infections.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product with multiple classifications:
* Corticosteroid (Clobetasol)
* Antibiotic (Gentamicin)
* Antifungal (Ketoconazole, Clioquinol, Tolnaftate)


**Mechanism of Action:**  This cream combines the anti-inflammatory action of a corticosteroid, the antibacterial effect of an antibiotic, and the antifungal properties of three distinct agents to provide comprehensive treatment.



## **Alternate Names**

There isn't a universally recognized generic name for this five-ingredient combination.  It is most accurately identified by listing its individual components.  Brand names vary regionally and internationally and include "Kitosan-Plus Cream," "CT Keto Cream,"  "KD5 + Cream," "Dermi 5 Cream," and "Dermiford Cream." Some preparations may substitute clotrimazole for ketoconazole.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**
* **Clobetasol:**  A potent topical corticosteroid that binds to glucocorticoid receptors in the skin, reducing inflammation by suppressing the immune response and inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins.
* **Gentamicin:**  An aminoglycoside antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, leading to bacterial cell death.
* **Ketoconazole:**  An imidazole antifungal that inhibits the synthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes.  This disruption of membrane integrity results in fungal cell death.
* **Clioquinol:**  An antifungal and antibacterial agent that inhibits DNA synthesis in susceptible organisms, leading to microbial cell death.
* **Tolnaftate:**  A thiocarbamate antifungal that also interferes with ergosterol synthesis, further disrupting fungal cell membrane integrity and inhibiting fungal growth.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily topical application. Systemic absorption can occur, particularly with prolonged use or application to large areas of damaged skin. Clobetasol is metabolized in the liver. Clioquinol can be nephrotoxic if absorbed systemically.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Clobetasol binds to glucocorticoid receptors. Gentamicin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to ribosomes. Ketoconazole and Tolnaftate inhibit ergosterol synthesis.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily through skin metabolism and desquamation. Some systemic absorption occurs, with subsequent hepatic metabolism (Clobetasol) and renal excretion (Clioquinol).


## **Dosage**

Dosage is individualized and requires consultation with a dermatologist or healthcare professional. The smallest amount should be used for the shortest duration possible.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  A thin layer applied to the affected area 1–2 times daily.  Treatment duration should be minimized due to the inclusion of a potent corticosteroid.

#### **Children:**  Use with extreme caution and only under strict medical supervision. Safety and efficacy not fully established.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Increased risk of skin thinning (atrophy) and other corticosteroid-related adverse effects. Monitor closely.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Systemic absorption of Clioquinol can occur. Monitor renal function and consider alternative treatments.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Clobetasol is metabolized in the liver, so use with caution and monitor closely.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate potential drug interactions and patient-specific factors, adjusting treatment as necessary.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination cream is generally not indicated for use in settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are made based on patient response, infection severity, and adverse effects.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Burning or stinging sensation, itching, redness, dryness, skin irritation.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Skin atrophy, striae (stretch marks), hypopigmentation, telangiectasia (spider veins), allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infections.

### **Long-Term Effects:**
Skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, Cushing's syndrome (with significant systemic absorption).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), adrenal suppression (with systemic absorption), worsening of infection.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any component, viral skin infections (e.g., herpes simplex, varicella), rosacea, acne, perioral dermatitis, primary bacterial or fungal infections without inflammation.


## **Drug Interactions**

Possible interactions with NSAIDs (increased bleeding risk with oral anticoagulants), systemic antifungals (azole antifungals may inhibit Clobetasol metabolism), other topical corticosteroids (additive effects).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category: C (consult a physician; insufficient data).  Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus. Unknown if excreted in breast milk; use with caution.

* **Side Effects:** Burning, itching, skin thinning, allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, viral skin infections.
* **Drug Interactions:** NSAIDs, systemic antifungals, topical corticosteroids.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; consult physician.
