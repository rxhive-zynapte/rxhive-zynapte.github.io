## **Usage**

This combination is prescribed for inflammatory skin infections with bacterial and fungal components, such as:

* Infected eczema or dermatitis
* Secondarily infected psoriasis
* Intertrigo
* Infected contact dermatitis
* Ringworm infections with secondary bacterial infection

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Corticosteroid (Clobetasol)
* Antibiotic (Gentamicin)
* Antifungal (Ketoconazole, Clioquinol)


## **Alternate Names**

There is no universally recognized generic name for this five-component combination.  It is most accurately identified by listing its individual components. Sometimes, Tolnaftate is included. Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Clobetasol:**  A potent corticosteroid that binds to glucocorticoid receptors, reducing inflammation, itching, and redness by suppressing the immune response and inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins.
* **Gentamicin:** An aminoglycoside antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death.
* **Ketoconazole:** An imidazole antifungal that disrupts fungal cell membrane synthesis by inhibiting ergosterol production.
* **Clioquinol:** A hydroxyquinoline antifungal and antibacterial agent that inhibits DNA synthesis in susceptible microorganisms.


**Pharmacokinetics:**

Topical application limits systemic absorption. However, some systemic absorption can occur, especially with prolonged use or application to large or broken skin areas. 

* **Clobetasol:** Metabolized in the liver.
* **Gentamicin:** Primarily excreted renally.
* **Ketoconazole:** Metabolized in the liver and excreted in bile and feces.
* **Clioquinol:**  Partially metabolized and excreted in urine and feces.



## **Dosage**

Because this is a combination of potent medications, dosage needs to be individualized. The smallest amount should be used for the shortest duration possible.  Always consult with a dermatologist or healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and a tailored treatment plan as there is no standard dosing information available for this specific five-ingredient combination in recognized sources.  Dosing depends upon the diagnosis, severity of the symptoms, patient comorbidities, and response to therapy.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

A thin layer of the cream is typically applied to the affected area 1-2 times daily.  Treatment duration should be as short as possible (typically not exceeding 2-4 weeks) to minimize the risk of side effects from the corticosteroid component (Clobetasol).


#### **Children:**

Use in children should be under strict medical supervision due to the potent corticosteroid component.  Safety and efficacy in children have not been fully established.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Increased risk of skin thinning and other adverse effects from Clobetasol. Use with caution.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Gentamicin can be nephrotoxic, and Clioquinol can be systemically absorbed. Monitor kidney function and consider alternatives. Dose adjustment based on renal function is crucial.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Clobetasol and Ketoconazole are metabolized in the liver. Careful patient monitoring and dose adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Assess potential drug interactions and adjust treatment as necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination cream is typically not indicated for use in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.
