## **Usage**

Clioquinol + Metronidazole is a combination medication used to treat various infections, including:

*   **Amebiasis:** An infection caused by the parasite *Entamoeba histolytica*.
*   **Giardiasis:** An infection of the small intestine caused by the parasite *Giardia lamblia*.
*   **Bacterial vaginosis:** An overgrowth of bacteria in the vagina.
*   **Trichomoniasis:** A sexually transmitted infection caused by the parasite *Trichomonas vaginalis*.
*   Certain skin infections caused by bacteria or fungi.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic, Antiprotozoal, Antifungal.

**Mechanism of Action:** Clioquinol has antifungal and antiprotozoal activity, while metronidazole is effective against anaerobic bacteria and some parasites. The combination provides broad-spectrum coverage. Metronidazole enters microbial cells and forms toxic free radicals that damage DNA, thus disrupting microbial growth. Clioquinol inhibits certain microbial enzymes, further contributing to its antimicrobial effects.


## **Alternate Names**

Clioquinol + Metronidazole; Iodochlorhydroxyquin + Metronidazole.  No popular brand names were found in the provided sources.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Metronidazole disrupts DNA synthesis and causes cell death in susceptible anaerobic bacteria and protozoa. Clioquinol affects energy production and membrane stability in fungi and some protozoa.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Metronidazole:** Well-absorbed orally, with bioavailability greater than 90%. Metabolized in the liver by CYP enzymes, primarily CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, and excreted mainly in the urine.
*   **Clioquinol:** Absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Its metabolic pathway is not well-characterized.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal for both drugs.

**Mode of Action:** Metronidazole is a prodrug that is activated within anaerobic microorganisms. The nitro group of metronidazole is reduced by microbial nitroreductases, forming reactive cytotoxic metabolites. These metabolites damage DNA and other macromolecules, leading to cell death. Clioquinol's antifungal and antiprotozoal mechanism is not fully elucidated but involves chelation of metal ions and disruption of microbial enzyme systems.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Not well-characterized for this combination.

## **Dosage**

Dosage varies depending on the infection being treated, patient age, and other factors. Always consult a physician for appropriate dosage recommendations.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Dosages provided in the sources vary significantly and require clinical judgement. For amebiasis, one suggested dose is 750 mg three times a day for 5-10 days. For giardiasis, single doses of 2g have been mentioned, as well as split doses over several days. For bacterial vaginosis, common regimens include 500 mg twice daily for 7 days, a single 2g dose, or 1g daily for two days.  For trichomoniasis, common regimens include a single 2g dose or 250 mg three times a day for 7 days.

#### **Children:**

Dosage is weight-based and must be determined by a physician.  Sources mention doses ranging from 15 mg/kg daily in 3 divided doses for amoebiasis, up to 35-50 mg/kg daily in 3 divided doses for other infections.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary due to age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustment may be necessary in severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease. Hemodialysis removes metronidazole, so supplementation may be required.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Close monitoring and dose reduction may be necessary.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments should be made based on the specific comorbidity.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage for these clinical scenarios is not well-defined in the provided sources and would be at the discretion of the treating physician.

*   **Intubation**
*   **Surgical Procedures** (Pre-operative prophylaxis doses have been mentioned.)
*   **Mechanical Ventilation**
*   **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
*   **Emergency Situations** 


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be necessary based on patient-specific factors such as renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain/cramps, metallic taste, headache, dizziness.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Seizures, peripheral neuropathy, encephalopathy, aseptic meningitis, liver injury, severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome), blood dyscrasias (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), anaphylaxis.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Peripheral neuropathy can occur with prolonged use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Anaphylaxis, severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to metronidazole, clioquinol, other nitroimidazoles, or any component of the formulation. First trimester of pregnancy (metronidazole).  Patients with Cockayne syndrome (metronidazole). Active or history of blood dyscrasias (metronidazole). Porphyria (metronidazole).  Certain neurological conditions. Clioquinol is contraindicated in children under 2 years old and in those with hypersensitivity to hydroxyquinolines, iodine, or other quinoline derivatives.



## **Drug Interactions**

Alcohol (disulfiram-like reaction), disulfiram, warfarin, lithium, phenytoin, phenobarbital, busulfan, drugs that prolong the QT interval (e.g., certain antipsychotics, some antibiotics), domperidone, famotidine, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, formoterol, olanzapine, alfuzosin, escitalopram, ondansetron.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy:** Metronidazole is generally avoided in the first trimester.  Use in later trimesters should be carefully considered. Clioquinol has limited safety data in pregnancy and is generally avoided.

**Breastfeeding:**  Metronidazole is excreted in breast milk. While generally considered compatible with breastfeeding, a decision should be made to discontinue breastfeeding or the drug, considering its importance to the mother. Monitor infants for loose stools, diaper rash, or thrush.
