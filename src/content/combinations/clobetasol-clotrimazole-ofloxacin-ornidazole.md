## **Usage**

This combination cream is prescribed for the topical treatment of superficial skin infections caused by a combination of fungi and bacteria, along with an inflammatory component.  It's commonly used for conditions like:

* Athlete's foot (tinea pedis) with secondary bacterial infection
* Jock itch (tinea cruris) with secondary bacterial infection
* Ringworm (tinea corporis) with secondary bacterial infection
* Other dermatomycoses complicated by bacterial superinfections and inflammation.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* **Clobetasol:** Corticosteroid (Topical)
* **Clotrimazole:** Antifungal (Imidazole derivative)
* **Ofloxacin:** Antibiotic (Fluoroquinolone)
* **Ornidazole:** Antibiotic (Nitroimidazole)

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination targets different aspects of the infection and inflammation:

* **Clobetasol:** Reduces inflammation by suppressing the immune response and decreasing the production of inflammatory mediators.
* **Clotrimazole:** Inhibits ergosterol synthesis, a crucial component of fungal cell membranes, leading to fungal cell death.
* **Ofloxacin:** Inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair, resulting in bacterial death.
* **Ornidazole:** Damages bacterial/protozoal DNA by forming reactive nitrogen species, leading to their death.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination does not have a universally recognized International Nonproprietary Name (INN). It's typically referred to by various brand names depending on the manufacturer.  Some examples of brand names include O2 Derm Cream and Panderm V Gel.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The combined action of the four components addresses both infection and inflammation.  Clobetasol provides rapid relief from inflammatory symptoms like itching and redness. Clotrimazole targets fungal pathogens, while Ofloxacin and Ornidazole offer broad-spectrum coverage against bacterial infections.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Primarily topical; systemic absorption is minimal with proper application.  However, some absorption can occur with prolonged use or application to large areas, especially with clobetasol.  

* **Clobetasol:** Metabolized in the liver and excreted via the kidneys.
* **Ofloxacin:**  Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine, with some hepatic metabolism.
* **Ornidazole:** Metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and feces.
* **Clotrimazole:** Metabolized in the liver and excreted in bile and feces.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer to the affected skin area twice daily, typically for 2-4 weeks. The duration depends on the severity and location of the infection.

#### **Children:** Use in children below 12 years of age is generally not recommended due to the potential for increased systemic absorption of clobetasol and its associated risks. Some sources advise against use in children under 17.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution and for limited periods due to potential for skin thinning. Monitor for systemic side effects.
