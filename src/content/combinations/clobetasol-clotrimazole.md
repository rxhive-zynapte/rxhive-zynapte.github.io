## **Usage**

Clobetasol + Clotrimazole is prescribed for inflammatory fungal skin infections such as athlete's foot (tinea pedis), jock itch (tinea cruris), and ringworm (tinea corporis). It combines a highly potent corticosteroid (clobetasol) with an antifungal agent (clotrimazole).  Clobetasol propionate belongs to the corticosteroids class of medications. Clotrimazole is in a class of antifungals called imidazoles.

Clobetasol decreases inflammation by suppressing the migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and reversing capillary permeability. Clotrimazole works by inhibiting ergosterol synthesis, an essential component of fungal cell membranes. This leads to increased permeability and leakage of cellular components, eventually causing fungal cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Clobetasol + Clotrimazole" is the standard generic name, some formulations include neomycin or fusidic acid and have varying names.  Brand names may vary depending on the region and the specific formulation. Some common brand names available in India include Clop-GM, Tenovate-M, Lobate-GM, Candid-B, Cosvate-GM etc.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Clobetasol exerts its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors, inhibiting inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes.  Clotrimazole inhibits the biosynthesis of ergosterol, a crucial component of the fungal cell membrane.  Disruption of the fungal cell membrane results in cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Clobetasol, when applied topically, has limited systemic absorption.  However, prolonged use or application over large areas may lead to measurable blood levels and systemic side effects. It is metabolized in the liver and eliminated through the kidneys. Some portion of the drug is also excreted in the bile. Clotrimazole, applied topically, has minimal systemic absorption, with most metabolized in the liver and eliminated through the feces and urine.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a thin layer to the affected area twice daily, typically for a duration determined by the specific condition and severity.  Treatment should generally not exceed two weeks for most dermatoses and four weeks for tinea pedis.

#### **Children:**

Use in children below 12 years old is generally not recommended. For adolescents (12–17 years), use should be limited and under strict medical supervision due to increased risk of systemic absorption. Topical corticosteroid use in children should be limited to five days or less if no improvement occurs and systemic absorption may also occur.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Similar to adults, but close monitoring for adverse effects is recommended.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised, though dose adjustment may not be necessary due to limited systemic absorption with topical use.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, and dose adjustment is indicated if signs of systemic absorption appear.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Patients with diabetes, Cushing's syndrome, and hypertension require careful monitoring due to the potential for drug interactions or exacerbation of these conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  

Clobetasol + Clotrimazole is exclusively for topical dermatological use and has no application in situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU care, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments might be necessary for elderly patients or patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Careful clinical assessment is necessary.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Burning, stinging, itching, dryness, irritation, erythema, folliculitis, hypopigmentation, and skin atrophy at the application site.



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic contact dermatitis, skin infections, telangiectasia, striae, Cushing's syndrome (with prolonged use or application over extensive areas).



### **Long-Term Effects**

Skin atrophy, telangiectasia, striae, and hypopigmentation can occur with prolonged or excessive use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions (angioedema, urticaria), adrenal suppression.




## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation, rosacea, perioral dermatitis, acne, viral skin infections (herpes simplex, varicella), bacterial or parasitic skin infections, tuberculosis of the skin, ulcerated lesions. Use on open wounds or broken skin should also be avoided.



## **Drug Interactions**

Concurrent use with other topical corticosteroids can increase the risk of systemic side effects.  Concomitant use of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., some oral contraceptives, antifungals) may alter metabolism of either agent. Interaction with alcoholic beverages is not clinically significant.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Clobetasol is classified as Pregnancy Category C.  Use during pregnancy should be limited to cases where the potential benefit to the mother outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.  Clotrimazole appears safe to use during pregnancy for topical and vaginal infections. Small amounts of clobetasol may be present in breast milk; however, topical application is generally considered safe. Breastfeeding mothers are advised to avoid using Clobetasol + Clotrimazole directly on the nipple. It is advisable to use it in the smallest possible area and for the shortest duration and make sure the baby does not come in contact with treated skin.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Clobetasol:  Anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive through glucocorticoid receptor binding. Clotrimazole: Inhibits ergosterol synthesis, disrupting fungal cell membrane integrity.
* **Side Effects:** Burning, itching, irritation, dryness, erythema, skin atrophy (long-term).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, rosacea, viral infections of the skin.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Other topical corticosteroids.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Caution advised. Use only if benefit outweighs risk.
* **Dosage:** Apply thinly twice daily.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for local skin reactions and signs of systemic absorption (especially with prolonged use or large areas of application) like weight gain, facial swelling, high blood sugar, high blood pressure etc.

## **Popular Combinations**

Clobetasol + Clotrimazole is sometimes combined with neomycin (an antibiotic) or fusidic acid (a topical antibiotic) for broader coverage of potential bacterial or mixed infections.


## **Precautions**

Avoid use on broken or open skin. Do not occlude the treated area unless instructed by a physician. Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Wash hands thoroughly after application. Patients with diabetes or those predisposed to skin infections should be closely monitored.  Do not apply to large areas of the body, under occlusive dressings, or for prolonged periods.
