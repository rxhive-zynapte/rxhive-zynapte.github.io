## **Usage**

This combination cream is prescribed for the treatment of various superficial skin infections caused by bacteria and fungi, along with inflammatory dermatoses, such as:

*   Dermatitis
*   Eczema
*   Psoriasis
*   Athlete's foot
*   Ringworm
*   Yeast infections
*   Sweat rash

**Pharmacological Classifications:**  This medication combines drugs from several classes to provide comprehensive treatment:

*   Corticosteroid (Clobetasol propionate): Potent, topical anti-inflammatory and antipruritic.
*   Antibiotic (Ofloxacin): Broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone, targeting bacterial infections.
*   Antifungal (Miconazole nitrate and Terbinafine hydrochloride): Effective against a variety of dermatophytes and yeasts.
*   Emollient (Dexpanthenol): Moisturizer that aids in skin repair.

**Mechanism of Action:**  Each component works synergistically:

*   Clobetasol: Suppresses inflammation by inhibiting chemical messengers that cause redness, swelling, and itching.
*   Ofloxacin: Interferes with bacterial DNA replication and repair, halting bacterial growth.
*   Miconazole and Terbinafine: Disrupt fungal cell membrane formation, killing and preventing fungal growth.
*   Dexpanthenol:  Softens and moisturizes, reducing itching and flaking, and promoting healing.



## **Alternate Names**

This combination cream is marketed under various brand names, including:

*   Derm Cream
*   Terbol Forte Cream
*   Terbicort-Total Cream
*   Zoyclo-M Plus Cream
*   Zyciderm Plus Cream
*   Olciderm
*   Terclo Cream



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

The combined effect of this cream targets both bacterial and fungal infections while mitigating inflammation and promoting skin repair.  The corticosteroid reduces inflammatory responses, the antibiotic eliminates bacteria, and the antifungals eradicate fungi.  The emollient supports skin barrier function and aids in healing.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   Absorption: Primarily topical with limited systemic absorption. Enhanced if applied to broken or damaged skin, potentially increasing systemic effects.
*   Metabolism: Information on the metabolism of this specific combination is limited.  However, it is known that topical corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver.  Ofloxacin is partially metabolized in the liver. Terbinafine is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP enzymes.
*   Elimination:  Topical corticosteroids, as well as their metabolites, are primarily excreted in the urine and bile. Ofloxacin is excreted in the urine and feces. Terbinafine and its metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine.

**Mode of Action:**

*   Clobetasol: Binds to glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm, influencing gene transcription and resulting in decreased inflammation.
*   Ofloxacin: Inhibits DNA gyrase, crucial for bacterial DNA replication and repair.
*   Miconazole: Inhibits ergosterol synthesis, a key component of fungal cell membranes.
*   Terbinafine: Inhibits squalene epoxidase, also involved in ergosterol synthesis.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a thin layer to the affected area twice daily, or as directed by a physician.  Treatment duration depends on the severity and type of infection.
