## **Usage**

This triple-combination topical medication is prescribed for inflammatory skin disorders complicated by secondary bacterial and fungal infections.  Specifically, it is indicated for:

*   Infected eczema
*   Dermatophytosis with inflammation
*   Superinfected dermatoses

**Pharmacological Classification:**

*   Clobetasol: Corticosteroid (very potent)
*   Fusidic Acid: Antibiotic
*   Miconazole: Antifungal

**Mechanism of Action:** This cream combines the effects of three active ingredients:

*   Clobetasol: Suppresses the inflammatory cascade, reducing swelling, itching, and redness.
*   Fusidic Acid: Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, primarily effective against Gram-positive bacteria.
*   Miconazole: Disrupts fungal cell membrane permeability, leading to fungal cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

*   Cutiderm (Brand name in some regions)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  The combined action of the three components addresses the complex nature of infected inflammatory skin conditions. Clobetasol provides potent anti-inflammatory action, while Fusidic Acid targets bacterial infection and Miconazole eliminates fungal pathogens.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The topical application minimizes systemic absorption. However, some absorption can occur, particularly with prolonged use or application over large areas, potentially leading to systemic side effects. Clobetasol is metabolized in the liver and excreted mainly through the kidneys. Fusidic acid is excreted primarily in bile. Miconazole is extensively metabolized in the liver with its metabolites excreted in urine and feces.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a thin layer to the affected area twice daily for a maximum of two weeks. Do not exceed 50g per week.

#### **Children:**

Use in children under 12 is generally not recommended unless specifically prescribed by a physician. If prescribed, the duration of use should not exceed five days.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to potential for increased systemic absorption and thinning of the skin.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Systemic absorption can be elevated in patients with severe renal dysfunction. 
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution due to the potential for increased systemic absorption and altered drug clearance.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with conditions like diabetes or hypertension that might be exacerbated by corticosteroids.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination cream is not typically indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments should be made based on patient response and the severity of the condition. Prolonged use should be avoided due to potential skin atrophy and other side effects.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Itching, burning, dryness, irritation, and redness at the application site

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, shortness of breath)
*   Worsening of skin infections

### **Long-Term Effects:**

*   Striae (stretch marks)
*   Hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth)
