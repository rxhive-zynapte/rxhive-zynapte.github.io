## **Usage**

Clobetasol + Gentamicin is prescribed for inflammatory skin conditions, especially those susceptible to or complicated by bacterial infections. These conditions include eczema, psoriasis, dermatitis, and other skin irritations.  It is effective against a variety of bacterial skin infections and reduces associated symptoms like pain, itching, redness, and oozing.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**
    - Clobetasol: Corticosteroid (topical)
    - Gentamicin: Aminoglycoside antibiotic (topical)

- **Mechanism of Action:**
    - Clobetasol: Suppresses the immune response, reducing inflammation by decreasing the production of inflammatory chemicals, and constricting blood vessels.
    - Gentamicin: Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death.


## **Alternate Names**

No commonly used alternate generic names exist. Various brand names are used, including Clobesol-Gm, Etan-NC, Etan-G,  CLOBETAMIL G, and others.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  
    - Clobetasol exerts potent anti-inflammatory, antipruritic (anti-itch), and vasoconstrictive effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the skin.  
    - Gentamicin binds to bacterial ribosomes, inhibiting protein synthesis, ultimately killing the bacteria.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - *Absorption:*  Both drugs have limited systemic absorption when applied topically as directed. Systemic absorption can increase if applied to large areas, broken skin, or under occlusive dressings.
    - *Metabolism:*  Clobetasol is primarily metabolized in the liver.  Gentamicin is not metabolized.
    - *Elimination:*  Clobetasol is excreted through urine and feces. Gentamicin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.

- **Mode of Action:**
    - Clobetasol: Modifies gene transcription and protein synthesis related to inflammation.
    - Gentamicin: Interferes with bacterial ribosomal function, disrupting protein synthesis.

- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**
    - Clobetasol:  Binds to glucocorticoid receptors.
    - Gentamicin:  Inhibits bacterial ribosomal function.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Apply a thin layer to affected areas 1-2 times daily. Do not exceed 50 g per week. Limit use to 2 weeks for inflammation/itching and up to 4 weeks for plaque psoriasis (depending on product and local guidelines).


#### **Children:**  Use in children under 12 is generally not recommended for Clobetasol + Gentamicin combination products. In children older than one year, similar dosage as adults can be used, but treatment duration is ideally limited to 5 days for ointment/cream and a few days for scalp solution. Review weekly. Foam is not recommended for children younger than 12.


#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** May be more susceptible to side effects; caution and dosage adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Gentamicin dosage should be adjusted based on renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised with Clobetasol in patients with hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Monitor patients with diabetes for changes in blood glucose control.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  The dosages described below refer specifically to the use of gentamicin alone in these cases.

- **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use/Emergency Situations:** Gentamicin, not in combination with clobetasol, is sometimes used parenterally for serious infections in such settings. Dosages are determined individually and depend on factors such as the infection's severity, patient's weight, and renal function.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be required based on the specific condition, severity, patient response, and the presence of renal or hepatic impairment. Monitor patients for local and systemic side effects, especially with prolonged use.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
Burning or stinging sensation, itching, skin dryness or cracking, redness, irritation, and thinning of the skin at the application site.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Allergic reactions, skin atrophy, striae (stretch marks), telangiectasia (spider veins), hypopigmentation, hypertrichosis (increased hair growth), folliculitis, Cushing's syndrome (with prolonged or extensive use), adrenal suppression.

### **Long-Term Effects**
Skin atrophy, telangiectasia, striae, hypopigmentation, glaucoma, cataracts (with prolonged use near the eyes).



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to clobetasol, gentamicin, or any other ingredients.  Untreated skin infections (viral, fungal, mycobacterial), rosacea, acne, perioral dermatitis, perianal/genital pruritus. Children below 1 year and nappy rash. Avoid use on broken or damaged skin or within skin folds.


## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP450 Interactions:**  Minimal CYP450 interactions are expected with topical application.
- **Other Interactions:**  
    - Ritonavir, Itraconazole: May increase the risk of side effects.
    - Other topical medications: Concurrent use may increase the risk of irritation or other adverse effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Clobetasol + Gentamicin is a pregnancy category C drug. Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus. 
- **Breastfeeding:**  Limited safety information.  Exercise caution; ensure the infant does not come into contact with treated areas.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
