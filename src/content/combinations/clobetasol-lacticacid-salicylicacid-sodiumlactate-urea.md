      **A:** Apply a thin layer to affected areas 1-2 times daily. Do not exceed
      50g per week.  Duration of therapy should not exceed 2 weeks for most
      inflammatory skin conditions and 4 weeks for plaque psoriasis. Use in
      children under 12 is generally not recommended.

## **Usage**

This topical combination medication is prescribed for inflammatory and pruritic (itchy) manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, including:

*   Psoriasis
*   Eczema
*   Lichen planus
*   Dermatitis
*   Corns and Calluses
*   Dry, hyperkeratotic lesions

**Pharmacological Classification:**

*   Corticosteroid (Clobetasol)
*   Keratolytic/peeling agent (Salicylic acid)
*   Emollient/Humectant (Urea, Lactic acid, and Sodium lactate)

**Mechanism of Action:**

Clobetasol, a potent corticosteroid, works by suppressing the skin's immune response and reducing inflammation, redness, and itching. Salicylic acid, a beta-hydroxy acid, and urea, a humectant, work together to soften and exfoliate the skin, removing dead skin cells and breaking down keratin.  Lactic acid and sodium lactate act as humectants, drawing and retaining moisture in the skin to prevent dryness. This combined action addresses both the underlying causes and symptoms of these skin conditions.


## **Alternate Names**

There are no officially recognized alternate names for this specific combination. However, it may be referred to by the names of its individual components. Several brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and specific formulation.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

Clobetasol propionate exerts its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the skin. This binding modulates gene expression, leading to a decrease in inflammatory mediators. Salicylic acid and urea promote keratolysis, softening and shedding the stratum corneum. Lactic acid and sodium lactate increase skin hydration and improve the barrier function.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

Percutaneous absorption of clobetasol is minimal when applied to intact skin. Systemic absorption may increase with the use of occlusive dressings, application to thin skin (e.g., face, intertriginous areas), or prolonged use.  Salicylic acid, urea, lactic acid, and sodium lactate are also minimally absorbed systemically.  Clobetasol is metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Salicylic acid is conjugated in the liver and excreted in the urine. Urea, lactic acid, and sodium lactate are also primarily eliminated through renal excretion.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a thin layer to the affected area 1-2 times daily, or as directed by a physician. Do not exceed 50g per week. Treatment duration should generally not exceed 2 weeks for most inflammatory skin conditions, and 4 weeks for plaque psoriasis.

#### **Children:**

Use in children under 12 years of age is generally not recommended unless specifically prescribed by a pediatrician. Pediatric safety concerns primarily relate to increased systemic absorption of clobetasol.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Close monitoring for adverse effects, particularly skin thinning, is recommended.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Exercise caution; monitor for potential adverse effects.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Exercise caution; monitor for potential adverse effects.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individual patient factors (e.g., diabetes, adrenal insufficiency, glaucoma, cataracts) must be considered.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is not typically indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient response, tolerance, and specific medical conditions.
