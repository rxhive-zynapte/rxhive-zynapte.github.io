## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for inflammatory skin disorders complicated by secondary bacterial and/or fungal infections.  These include conditions like eczema, psoriasis, dermatitis, and tinea infections where inflammation, bacterial infection, and fungal infection co-exist.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing a corticosteroid (clobetasol), an antifungal (miconazole), an antibiotic (neomycin), and an astringent/anti-inflammatory agent (zinc sulfate).

- **Mechanism of Action:** Clobetasol is a potent topical corticosteroid that reduces inflammation by suppressing the immune response and constricting blood vessels. Miconazole inhibits fungal growth by disrupting the synthesis of ergosterol, a crucial component of the fungal cell membrane.  Neomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. Zinc sulfate exerts astringent and mild anti-inflammatory actions.

## **Alternate Names**

No internationally recognized non-proprietary name exists for this combination. It may be referred to by the names of its individual components.

- **Brand Names:** Several brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region. Some examples include "A TO Z Cream", "Afderm Plus Cream", and "Agiclob NM Cream."  Many other brand names also exist.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Clobetasol reduces inflammation, itching, and redness. Miconazole eliminates fungal infection. Neomycin eliminates bacterial infection.  Zinc sulfate promotes drying and healing.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Clobetasol is minimally absorbed systemically when applied topically.  Systemic absorption of neomycin is also low with intact skin, but increases with broken skin.  Miconazole and zinc sulfate have minimal systemic absorption.  Metabolism and excretion data for the combination are limited, as studies usually focus on the individual components. Clobetasol is primarily metabolized in the liver. Neomycin is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys.  Miconazole is metabolized in the liver. Zinc is primarily excreted in feces.

- **Mode of Action:**  See "Mechanism of Action" in the "Usage" section.

- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Clobetasol binds to glucocorticoid receptors.  Miconazole inhibits fungal cytochrome P450 enzymes. Neomycin inhibits bacterial ribosomal protein synthesis.

- **Elimination Pathways:** See "Pharmacokinetics."

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Apply a thin layer to the affected area twice daily.

#### **Children:** Apply a thin layer to the affected area of children over 2 years of age twice daily, under strict medical supervision. It's essential to re-evaluate treatment weekly for pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Close monitoring is recommended due to increased susceptibility to adverse effects like skin thinning. Dose adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient response.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Exercise caution due to the nephrotoxic potential of neomycin. Monitor renal function. Dose adjustment might be required.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Clobetasol is metabolized in the liver. Caution is advised. Monitor liver function and consider dose adjustments.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor closely in patients with other conditions due to possible drug interactions or altered drug metabolism. Adjust dose as necessary.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination cream is not typically indicated for systemic medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary use is limited to topical application on affected skin areas.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are based on patient factors like age, renal function, hepatic function, and other medical conditions. Monitor patients for adverse effects and adjust the dose as necessary.
