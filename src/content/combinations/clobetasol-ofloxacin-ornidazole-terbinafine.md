## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the topical treatment of superficial skin infections caused by a mix of bacteria and fungi, especially when accompanied by inflammation.  It is effective against dermatophyte infections (e.g., tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea pedis), bacterial infections (e.g., impetigo), and inflammatory skin conditions such as infected eczema and dermatitis.  It is also used in the treatment of mixed and complicated fungal, protozoal, and bacterial infections; mild to moderate vaginitis; candidiasis and trichomoniasis; pruritus vulvae; and genito-urinary infections. It is available as a cream, gel, or ointment for topical application. This combination is classified as a corticosteroid, antibacterial, and antifungal agent.


The mechanism of action involves the combined effects of its components: Clobetasol, a potent corticosteroid, reduces inflammation; Ofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, inhibits bacterial DNA replication; Ornidazole, a nitroimidazole antibiotic, disrupts bacterial DNA and protein synthesis (effective against anaerobic bacteria and some protozoa); and Terbinafine, an antifungal, inhibits fungal cell membrane synthesis by targeting squalene epoxidase.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is often referred to as Clobetasol/Ofloxacin/Ornidazole/Terbinafine combination cream/ointment/gel. Brand names include Dermomix, Combicid, Olciderm, Oftiderm, Terbinaforce-Plus, Offtex-OT, Alnabate Forte, and Antilox TC, among others. Availability of specific brands depends on the manufacturer and region. Please note that the combination is banned in India due to potential for severe side effects.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Clobetasol exerts anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors. Ofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.  Ornidazole forms reactive metabolites that damage bacterial DNA. Terbinafine inhibits squalene epoxidase, a key enzyme in fungal ergosterol biosynthesis.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The combination is applied topically.  Clobetasol is absorbed percutaneously, metabolized in the liver, and excreted mainly in urine and bile. Ofloxacin exhibits minimal systemic absorption after topical application but can have systemic effects if used on large areas or broken skin, it is metabolized in the liver. Ornidazole also has low systemic absorption following topical application, it is metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine. Terbinafine is absorbed through the skin, reaching peak plasma concentrations within a few hours, it is metabolized by CYP enzymes in the liver and eliminated primarily in urine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer to the affected skin area twice daily.  Treatment duration typically ranges from 1-2 weeks depending on the infection.

#### **Children:** Use in children under 12 years is generally not recommended due to limited safety data. Some sources recommend against use in children under 18. If necessary, use under strict medical supervision with careful monitoring.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to potential for increased systemic absorption, monitor for side effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be needed if significant systemic absorption occurs.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustments may be needed if significant systemic absorption occurs, closely monitor for side effects.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with diabetes, as topical corticosteroids can affect blood glucose levels.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This topical medication is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. It is meant for treating superficial skin infections.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are usually not necessary for topical application unless substantial systemic absorption is suspected due to factors like open wounds or application over a large area. Monitor patients with renal or hepatic impairment if such situations arise.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Burning, itching, irritation, dry skin, skin peeling, skin thinning (with long-term use), redness at application site.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, shortness of breath), skin atrophy, hypopigmentation, telangiectasia, striae, folliculitis.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Skin atrophy, telangiectasia, striae, hypopigmentation.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any of the components, viral skin infections (e.g., herpes simplex, varicella), cutaneous tuberculosis, fungal infections caused by non-susceptible species, rosacea, perioral dermatitis, acne, ulcerative conditions. Use with caution in patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease, liver impairment, or autoimmune disorders.

## **Drug Interactions**

May interact with oral or topical corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone), other systemic antibiotics or antifungals (e.g., itraconazole), NSAIDs (e.g., diclofenac), antacids (e.g., aluminum hydroxide), multivitamins containing zinc or iron, blood thinners (e.g., warfarin, heparin), and some seizure medications (e.g., phenytoin). Tizanidine should not be used concurrently due to severe interactions.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been established. Use only if clearly needed and under strict medical supervision.
