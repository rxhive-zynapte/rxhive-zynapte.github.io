## **Usage**

- This combination medication is prescribed for the topical treatment of superficial mixed skin infections caused by susceptible bacteria and fungi.  It is effective against dermatophyte infections (e.g., tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea pedis), bacterial infections (e.g., impetigo), and inflammatory skin conditions like eczema and dermatitis complicated by secondary infection.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Combination product containing a corticosteroid (Clobetasol), a fluoroquinolone antibiotic (Ofloxacin), and an antifungal (Terbinafine).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Clobetasol reduces inflammation and itching, Ofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA replication and repair, and Terbinafine interferes with fungal cell membrane synthesis.

## **Alternate Names**

- Clobetasol/Ofloxacin/Terbinafine combination cream/ointment
- Brand names:  Oftiderm, Combicid, Alnabate Forte Cream, Lefla Plus Cream, Axxo Cream, Combicid Cream, Combo 4 Cream, Dermacom Cream, Dermomix Cream, Dermoquad Cream, Mycofree-OC Cream, Tetramix Cream, others. Brand names vary by region and manufacturer.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Clobetasol exerts anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive effects by activating phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins. Ofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, essential enzymes for bacterial DNA replication and repair.  Terbinafine inhibits squalene epoxidase, disrupting fungal cell membrane synthesis. Ornidazole interferes with microbial DNA, leading to cell death.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily topical action. Minimal systemic absorption occurs, although it can increase with prolonged use or application over large areas. Each component has its own pharmacokinetic profile, but specific data on the combination product's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion is limited.
- **Elimination pathways:**  Each component has its unique elimination pathway. Clobetasol is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted via the kidneys. Ofloxacin is mainly excreted unchanged in urine and feces. Terbinafine undergoes hepatic metabolism and is eliminated primarily in the urine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 
Apply a thin layer to the affected skin area twice daily.

#### **Children:**  Use in children under 12 years is generally not recommended due to limited safety and efficacy data. Some sources advise against use in those under 18. When prescribed, the dosage and duration should be determined by a physician based on the child's age, weight, and the specific condition.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Same as adult dosing, but monitor closely for adverse effects due to potentially thinner skin and increased absorption.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution advised; monitor for systemic side effects.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution advised; monitor for systemic side effects due to potential changes in drug metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Assess patient-specific conditions for potential drug interactions or contraindications.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is intended for *topical use only* and is not indicated for:

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments based on renal/hepatic dysfunction should be made cautiously with close monitoring for side effects.  Consider reducing the application frequency or using a lower potency corticosteroid in such cases.
