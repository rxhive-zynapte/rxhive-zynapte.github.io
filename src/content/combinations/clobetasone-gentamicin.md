## **Usage**

Clobetasone + Gentamicin is prescribed for inflammatory skin disorders, especially where bacterial infection is present, suspected, or likely to occur. These conditions may include:

*   Eczema
*   Psoriasis
*   Dermatitis
*   Impetigo

**Pharmacological Classification:**

*   Clobetasone: Topical Corticosteroid
*   Gentamicin: Aminoglycoside Antibiotic

**Mechanism of Action:**

Clobetasone reduces inflammation by suppressing the immune response, decreasing the production of inflammatory chemicals, and constricting blood vessels. Gentamicin combats bacterial infections by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.


## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for the combination product itself.  However, each component has other names. Clobetasone may be referred to as clobetasone butyrate.  Gentamicin is sometimes referred to as gentamicin sulfate.  This combination is frequently sold under various brand names which vary by region. 



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Clobetasone exerts its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic (anti-itch), and vasoconstrictive effects through binding to glucocorticoid receptors. Gentamicin binds to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, disrupting protein synthesis and leading to bacterial cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Clobetasone, when applied topically, is minimally absorbed systemically. Gentamicin also has limited systemic absorption when applied topically to intact skin.  However, absorption may be increased if applied over large areas, broken, denuded, or inflamed skin.  Systemic absorption may lead to the drug's metabolism and elimination via the kidneys for gentamicin and primarily by the liver for clobetasone. 

**Mode of Action:** As above, Clobetasone modulates gene expression to reduce inflammatory responses. Gentamicin interferes with bacterial ribosomal function.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Clobetasone binds to glucocorticoid receptors. Gentamicin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by targeting the 30S ribosomal subunit.

**Elimination Pathways:** Minimally absorbed Clobetasone is primarily metabolized hepatically and excreted in bile and urine. Minimally absorbed Gentamicin is primarily excreted renally.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Apply a thin layer to the affected skin area twice daily. Do not use for more than two consecutive weeks. Maximum weekly dose should not exceed 50g.

#### **Children:** Use in children younger than 12 is generally not recommended, although some formulations may be used in children older than one year under strict medical supervision.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients**: Similar to adults, but use with caution and monitor for adverse effects.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Topical Gentamicin is generally safe due to minimal systemic absorption with intact skin. Caution is advised for use in patients with renal impairment and open skin lesions due to potential systemic absorption, and serum levels may need to be monitored.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Topical Clobetasone is generally safe due to minimal systemic absorption with intact skin. Caution is advised in patients with hepatic dysfunction and open skin lesions due to potential systemic absorption.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**:  Use with caution in patients with diabetes or other conditions that may be affected by corticosteroid use.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication is typically not indicated for use in these clinical settings (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations).  Its use is limited to topical skin application.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments should be made based on individual patient response, the severity of the condition, and the affected area's size. If no improvement is seen within two weeks, reassessment of the diagnosis may be necessary.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

*   Burning or stinging sensation
*   Itching
*   Dryness
*   Irritation
*   Redness

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

*   Allergic contact dermatitis
*   Skin atrophy
*   Telangiectasia
*   Hypopigmentation
*   Hypertrichosis
*   Secondary infections

### **Long-Term Effects**

*   Skin thinning
*   Striae (stretch marks)

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

*   Severe skin reactions (rare)



## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to Clobetasone, Gentamicin, or any other ingredients.
*   Rosacea
*   Acne vulgaris
*   Perioral dermatitis
*   Viral skin infections (e.g., herpes simplex, chickenpox)
*   Fungal skin infections (unless in combination with an appropriate antifungal)
*   Tuberculosis of the skin

## **Drug Interactions**

*   No significant drug interactions are typically expected with topical application. However, concomitant use of other topical medications on the same area should be done cautiously.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be under the guidance of a physician. Topical use of Clobetasone + Gentamicin is generally considered low risk during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to limited systemic absorption, but benefits and risks should be carefully evaluated.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:**  Clobetasone: Anti-inflammatory and vasoconstrictive. Gentamicin: Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis.
*   **Side Effects:** Burning, stinging, itching, dryness, irritation.  Rarely: allergic reactions, skin atrophy.
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, rosacea, acne, viral skin infections.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Limited with topical use.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally considered safe for topical use, but consult a physician.
*   **Dosage:**  Apply thinly twice daily for up to two weeks; do not exceed 50 g/week.
*   **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for treatment response and local skin reactions.



## **Popular Combinations**

This combination itself is popular for treating inflammatory skin conditions complicated by bacterial infection. The addition of an antifungal like Miconazole is often included for broader coverage.


## **Precautions**

*   Avoid contact with eyes, mucous membranes, and open wounds.
*   Do not use with occlusive dressings.
*   Use cautiously in areas with thin skin (face, groin, skinfolds).
*   Discontinue use if no improvement is seen within two weeks.
