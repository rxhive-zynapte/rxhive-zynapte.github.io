## **Usage**

This combination is primarily prescribed for female infertility, particularly in cases of irregular or absent ovulation, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It is also used to improve male fertility by enhancing sperm quality.

Clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Vitamin B6 is an essential vitamin. Coenzyme Q10 is an antioxidant. Zinc is an essential nutrient.

This combination works by stimulating the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which leads to increased secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). These hormones promote the development and maturation of ovarian follicles, ultimately leading to ovulation.  Vitamin B6 helps regulate prolactin levels, which can interfere with ovulation if elevated. Zinc is crucial for egg production and hormone balance. Coenzyme Q10, as an antioxidant, protects developing eggs from free radical damage.  In males, this combination improves sperm parameters.

## **Alternate Names**

* Productiv-M Tablet
* Clofert Max Kit

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Clomiphene, a SERM, acts on the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and ovaries. It primarily occupies estrogen receptors, reducing negative feedback and thereby increasing GnRH, FSH, and LH secretion.  This hormonal cascade stimulates follicular growth and maturation, culminating in ovulation. Vitamin B6 contributes to normal hormonal balance, influencing prolactin levels and supporting reproductive function. Zinc is essential for cell division, growth, and hormone production, playing a role in ovarian function and egg development. Coenzyme Q10, a potent antioxidant, protects cells from oxidative stress, improving the quality of oocytes and sperm.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Clomiphene is well-absorbed orally.  It is metabolized in the liver and primarily excreted in feces.  Vitamin B6 is readily absorbed and converted to its active form, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. It is mainly excreted in urine. Zinc absorption is influenced by dietary factors. It is stored in various tissues and eliminated primarily through feces. Coenzyme Q10 absorption can be variable. It is transported in lipoproteins and metabolized to ubiquinol.

**Mode of Action:** Clomiphene primarily acts by modulating estrogen receptor activity in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, leading to increased gonadotropin release. Vitamin B6 acts as a cofactor for enzymes involved in various metabolic processes, including hormone synthesis. Zinc is essential for the function of numerous enzymes and transcription factors involved in reproductive processes.  Coenzyme Q10 is a key component of the electron transport chain in mitochondria, acting as an antioxidant and protecting cells from oxidative damage.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  One tablet containing 25 mg clomiphene, 1.5 mg vitamin B6, 66 mg of zinc, and 60 mg coenzyme Q10, taken orally once daily for 5 days, starting on the 5th day of the menstrual cycle. The dosage and duration of treatment may be adjusted based on individual patient response and clinical judgment. For men, dosages may vary depending on the formulation and clinical goals.

#### **Children:** This medication is not indicated for use in children.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required, but caution is advised due to potential age-related decline in organ function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment may not be necessary, but clinical monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution, as this combination is considered potentially unsafe in patients with liver disease.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Pre-existing conditions, including thyroid disorders, should be considered.
