## **Usage**

Clopidogrel + Rosuvastatin is prescribed for the prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, in patients with atherosclerosis (documented by recent stroke, myocardial infarction, or established peripheral arterial disease) or those at high risk for acute coronary syndrome. It is also used to reduce high cholesterol levels in the body.  This combination medication belongs to the pharmacological classifications of antiplatelet agents (clopidogrel) and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) (rosuvastatin).

Clopidogrel works by inhibiting platelet aggregation, thus preventing blood clot formation. Rosuvastatin reduces cholesterol production in the body by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme essential for cholesterol synthesis. The combined effect helps manage cholesterol levels and reduces the risk of blood clots.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for the combination itself. However, the individual components have various generic and brand names. Rosuvastatin is sometimes called by its chemical name, (3R,5S)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]pyrimidin-5-yl]-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acid calcium salt. Clopidogrel is also known as methyl (2S)-2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(6,7-dihydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridin-5(4H)-yl)acetate bisulfate.  Brand names for combination products containing Clopidogrel and Rosuvastatin include Rosuvas CV and Rosugrel.  Many other brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and country.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Rosuvastatin lowers LDL ("bad") cholesterol and triglycerides while raising HDL ("good") cholesterol. Clopidogrel irreversibly inhibits P2Y12 receptors on platelets, preventing ADP-induced platelet aggregation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Rosuvastatin:**  Rosuvastatin is administered orally. Absorption: Approximately 50% absorbed, peak plasma concentration reached in about 5 hours. Metabolism: Primarily hepatic by CYP2C9, minimal metabolism by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Excretion: Primarily biliary (90%), some renal excretion (10%). 

* **Clopidogrel:**  Clopidogrel is also administered orally, requiring conversion to its active metabolite by hepatic CYP enzymes, mainly CYP2C19. Absorption: Well-absorbed; peak plasma concentration in ~1 hour (inactive parent drug); active metabolite peak in ~2 hours.  Metabolism: Two-step hepatic bioactivation through CYP enzymes (primarily CYP2C19). Elimination:  Primarily urinary excretion (50% as inactive metabolites); 46% as clopidogrel in feces. Half-life: About 6 hours (parent drug), active thiol metabolite unknown.

**Mode of Action:** Rosuvastatin competitively inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, blocking cholesterol synthesis in the liver. Clopidogrel's active metabolite irreversibly binds to the P2Y12 receptor on platelets, preventing ADP-stimulated platelet activation and aggregation.

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Rosuvastatin: Enzyme inhibition (HMG-CoA reductase). Clopidogrel: Receptor binding (P2Y12 receptor antagonist).

**Elimination pathways:** Rosuvastatin: Primarily biliary excretion. Clopidogrel: Primarily urinary excretion.


## **Dosage**

Dosage is individualized and based on the patient's specific condition, comorbidities, and response to therapy. It is important to follow the prescriber's instructions.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Rosuvastatin:  The usual starting dose is 10â€“20 mg orally once a day.  It can be titrated up to 40 mg daily in some cases, but this highest dose carries greater risk and is generally not recommended. 
Clopidogrel: 75 mg orally once a day is the usual maintenance dose.  A loading dose of 300 mg or up to 600 mg is sometimes used for acute coronary syndrome. 

#### **Children:**

The combination is generally not recommended for children under 18 years of age, unless under direct specialist supervision. Rosuvastatin is approved for certain pediatric uses (e.g., familial hypercholesterolemia), but appropriate pediatric dosing for clopidogrel hasn't been established for most indications.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Starting dose of rosuvastatin should be 5 mg and carefully titrated if needed. Clopidogrel is generally used with caution, particularly in the very elderly.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Rosuvastatin:  Dose adjustments are necessary in moderate to severe renal impairment (see below).  Clopidogrel: Use with caution, consider dose reduction.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Rosuvastatin: Contraindicated in patients with active liver disease. Clopidogrel: Use with caution in moderate hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration is needed in patients with diabetes, hypothyroidism, or those taking interacting medications (see Drug Interactions).


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The specific combination is not typically prescribed for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Individual components may be used in these settings with careful consideration of risks and benefits.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Rosuvastatin:  In moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60 ml/min), the recommended starting dose is 5 mg once daily.  In severe renal impairment, rosuvastatin is contraindicated. 
Clopidogrel dose adjustments are based on CYP2C19 metabolizer status, but genetic testing is not always available or practical. Patients with reduced CYP2C19 function may require alternative therapies.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Myalgia (muscle pain)
* Arthralgia (joint pain)
* Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown)
* Myopathy (muscle weakness)
* Liver dysfunction
* Bleeding events (including intracranial hemorrhage)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, angioedema)
* Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

The long-term effects of combination use are still being studied, but potential issues include increased risk of muscle and liver problems with ongoing exposure to rosuvastatin.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Rhabdomyolysis, hepatic dysfunction, severe bleeding, TTP require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to rosuvastatin or clopidogrel
* Active liver disease (rosuvastatin)
* Active bleeding disorders (clopidogrel)
* Pregnancy (rosuvastatin)
* Breastfeeding (both drugs are generally avoided)
* Severe renal impairment (rosuvastatin)

## **Drug Interactions**

* **CYP450 interactions:** Rosuvastatin is a substrate of CYP2C9.  Concomitant use with CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g., azole antifungals, some antibiotics) may increase rosuvastatin levels and the risk of myopathy. Clopidogrel is metabolized by CYP2C19. Inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., some proton pump inhibitors, some antidepressants) may reduce clopidogrel efficacy.
* **Other interactions:** Concomitant use with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin) may increase bleeding risk.  Gemfibrozil, cyclosporine, and certain antivirals may interact with rosuvastatin, increasing the risk of myopathy.
* **Food and lifestyle factors:** Grapefruit juice and alcohol should be avoided as they may interact with rosuvastatin, and grapefruit juice can increase serum clopidogrel active metabolite levels.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Rosuvastatin is contraindicated in pregnancy (Pregnancy Category X).  Clopidogrel use during pregnancy should be avoided unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. Both drugs should be avoided during breastfeeding due to the potential for neonatal exposure. Safer alternatives should be considered if possible.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Rosuvastatin: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Clopidogrel: P2Y12 receptor antagonist.
* **Side Effects:**  See Side Effects section above.
* **Contraindications:** See Contraindications section above.
* **Drug Interactions:** See Drug Interactions section above.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** See Pregnancy and Breastfeeding section above.

## **Popular Combinations**

The combination of clopidogrel and rosuvastatin is itself a popular combination for patients requiring both cholesterol management and antiplatelet therapy.  Aspirin is sometimes added to this combination for enhanced antiplatelet effects, but this increases bleeding risk.

## **Precautions**

Pre-screening should be done for allergies, liver and kidney function, and any bleeding disorders. Alcohol, grapefruit, and interacting medications should be avoided.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should not take rosuvastatin. This combination is generally avoided in breastfeeding women.  Elderly patients require careful monitoring.
