## **Usage**

Clotrimazole + Hydrocortisone is prescribed for fungal skin infections where inflammation (e.g., itching, redness) is also present. It is particularly effective for conditions like athlete's foot (tinea pedis), jock itch (tinea cruris), and ringworm (tinea corporis).  It combines the anti-fungal effects of clotrimazole with the anti-inflammatory and antipruritic (anti-itching) effects of hydrocortisone.

Its pharmacological classifications are:  
* Antifungal (Clotrimazole)
* Corticosteroid, mild potency (Hydrocortisone)


Clotrimazole works by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol, a crucial component of fungal cell membranes. This disruption leads to increased membrane permeability and ultimately fungal cell death. Hydrocortisone, a glucocorticoid, exerts its anti-inflammatory and antipruritic effects by modulating inflammatory responses in the skin, providing symptomatic relief.


## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication may be referred to as clotrimazole/hydrocortisone.

Brand names include Canesten HC, Lotriderm, and Hydrozole. Regional variations and additional brand names may exist.



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Clotrimazole acts as a broad-spectrum antifungal agent, effective against dermatophytes, yeasts, and other fungi.  It disrupts fungal cell membrane integrity. Hydrocortisone provides anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, antiexudative (reducing fluid leakage), and antiallergic effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Clotrimazole:** Topically applied clotrimazole penetrates the epidermis, with minimal systemic absorption (3-10% after vaginal application, less through skin).
* **Hydrocortisone:** Absorbed through the skin, especially in areas with damaged skin.  Systemic absorption is generally low but can increase with factors like prolonged use, application to large areas, use under occlusive dressings, or application to damaged skin. Metabolism occurs primarily in the liver, and excretion is mainly through the kidneys.


**Mode of Action:**
* **Clotrimazole:** Inhibits ergosterol synthesis in fungal cell membranes, leading to membrane disruption and fungal cell death.
* **Hydrocortisone:** Binds to glucocorticoid receptors, modulating inflammatory responses, suppressing immune cell activity, and reducing pro-inflammatory mediator production.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism and renal excretion for both drugs.




## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Apply a thin layer to the affected skin area twice daily, usually in the morning and evening. Gently rub into the skin. The maximum duration of treatment is typically 7 days. The maximum daily dose is 10 mg/kg (e.g., 500 mg for a 50 kg adult), equivalent to approximately 2 cm of cream divided into two applications.

#### **Children:** Shorter treatment durations are generally recommended for children. Pediatric dosage should be determined based on the child's weight and age, under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  Avoid long-term use, especially in infants and children.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use the minimum effective quantity for the shortest duration necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may not be necessary due to low systemic absorption, but caution is advised.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Monitor for increased systemic effects of hydrocortisone. Dosage adjustment may be considered.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate the patient's overall health status and consider potential drug interactions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of clotrimazole and hydrocortisone is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its use is limited to topical treatment of fungal skin infections with associated inflammation.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modification may be necessary based on factors such as patient age, the affected area's size, the severity of the infection, and the presence of other medical conditions.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Dry or peeling skin
* Minor skin irritation, burning, or itching
* Erythema
* Stinging


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (skin rash, itching, hives, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue)
* Blistering, oozing, open sores
* Secondary infections
* Signs of Cushing's syndrome (weight gain, moon face, buffalo hump) with prolonged use
* Adrenal suppression with prolonged use


### **Long-Term Effects:**

* Skin thinning (atrophy)
* Telangiectasias (spider veins)
* Striae (stretch marks)
* Hypopigmentation (skin lightening)
* Steroid withdrawal syndrome upon abrupt discontinuation after prolonged use




### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

* Angioedema
* Anaphylaxis



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to clotrimazole, hydrocortisone, or any component of the formulation.
* Untreated bacterial or viral skin infections (e.g., herpes simplex, chickenpox)
* Acne, rosacea, perioral dermatitis
* Tuberculosis or syphilis affecting the skin
* Dermal vaccination reactions
* Broken skin at the application site



## **Drug Interactions**

* May decrease the effectiveness of latex contraceptives (condoms, diaphragms).
* Hydrocortisone can interact with certain medications, including some antibiotics, anticoagulants, and antihypertensives.
* Clotrimazole may interact with other azole antifungals and certain immunosuppressants.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Clotrimazole is considered Pregnancy Category A in some regions, meaning no evidence of harm to the fetus has been observed in human studies. However, use during pregnancy should be under the supervision of a physician or midwife, and prolonged use should be avoided as a precaution.

Clotrimazole is present in breast milk in small amounts after oral or topical administration. Although the risk to the infant is considered low, avoid applying the cream directly to the nipples before breastfeeding. Consider using water-miscible creams or gels on the breast area if treatment is needed.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Clotrimazole: Inhibits ergosterol synthesis, disrupting fungal cell membranes; Hydrocortisone: Modulates inflammatory responses, providing anti-inflammatory and antipruritic effects.
* **Side Effects:** Common: Skin irritation, dryness, burning; Rare: Allergic reactions, adrenal suppression, skin thinning.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, untreated infections (bacterial/viral), certain skin conditions, broken skin.
* **Drug Interactions:** May reduce latex contraceptive effectiveness; Interactions with other medications are possible, especially for hydrocortisone.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally considered safe for short-term use, but avoid nipple application before breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** Adults: Thin layer twice daily for up to 7 days; Children: Shorter durations; Special adjustments for certain conditions.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for treatment response and side effects, particularly with long-term use.  Assess for signs of adrenal suppression with prolonged use of hydrocortisone.



## **Popular Combinations**

Clotrimazole and hydrocortisone are commonly combined in a single topical formulation.  Other antifungals can also be combined with corticosteroids for enhanced efficacy in treating inflamed fungal skin infections.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess for allergies and contraindications. Use the minimum quantity for the shortest duration necessary.
* **Specific Populations:** Pregnant/breastfeeding women: Use cautiously under medical supervision; Children/elderly:  Use shorter durations.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid alcohol, as it can interact with hydrocortisone. Smoking can impair wound healing and affect treatment response.
