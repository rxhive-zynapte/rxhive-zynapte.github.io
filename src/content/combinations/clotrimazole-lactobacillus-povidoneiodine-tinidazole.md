## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the treatment of various vaginal infections, particularly those causing vaginal discharge. It is effective against mixed infections due to its antifungal, antibacterial, antiseptic, and antiprotozoal properties.  It is classified as a combination topical antimicrobial and antifungal agent.

## **Alternate Names**

* Dresin-V
* Novadine Pessaries
* Candigem Tablet


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Clotrimazole:**  Inhibits ergosterol synthesis, a crucial component of the fungal cell membrane. This disruption compromises membrane integrity, leading to fungal cell death.
* **Lactobacillus:**  A probiotic that helps restore the normal vaginal flora. It produces lactic acid and other substances creating an acidic vaginal environment that is unfavorable for the growth of pathogenic bacteria and fungi.
* **Povidone Iodine:** A broad-spectrum antiseptic that releases iodine slowly, killing bacteria, fungi, and protozoa.
* **Tinidazole:** An antiprotozoal and antibacterial agent that inhibits DNA synthesis in susceptible microorganisms, causing cell death. It is particularly effective against anaerobic bacteria and certain protozoa.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

This combination is administered intravaginally, resulting in localized action.  Absorption into the systemic circulation is minimal. Information on the specific metabolism and elimination of each component when used in this combination is limited. However, individually, clotrimazole is metabolized hepatically, tinidazole is metabolized in the liver, and both are excreted primarily through urine and feces.  Povidone iodine is minimally absorbed. Lactobacillus acts locally within the vaginal flora.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One vaginal tablet/pessary/suppository is inserted high into the vagina once daily, preferably at bedtime, for a duration typically ranging from 1 to 7 nights. The treatment duration depends on the severity of the infection and can be adjusted based on physician discretion.

#### **Children:**

This medication is not generally recommended for pediatric use. If deemed necessary, administration should be under strict medical supervision.

#### **Special Cases:**
