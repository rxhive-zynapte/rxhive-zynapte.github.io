## **Usage**

Clotrimazole + Lidocaine + Ofloxacin is prescribed for the treatment of superficial bacterial and fungal infections of the external auditory canal (otitis externa) and middle ear (otitis media), particularly when inflammation and pain are present.  It is effective against organisms susceptible to ofloxacin and clotrimazole.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product with multiple classifications:

* **Ofloxacin:** Fluoroquinolone antibiotic
* **Clotrimazole:** Imidazole antifungal
* **Lidocaine:** Local anesthetic
* **Beclometasone:** Corticosteroid (anti-inflammatory)

**Mechanism of Action:**

* **Ofloxacin:** Inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair, leading to bacterial cell death.
* **Clotrimazole:** Alters fungal cell membrane permeability, causing leakage of essential cellular contents and inhibiting fungal growth.
* **Lidocaine:** Blocks voltage-gated sodium channels, inhibiting nerve impulse transmission and producing local anesthesia.
* **Beclometasone:**  Exerts anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive effects. Binds to glucocorticoid receptors, modulating inflammatory responses.

## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination. It is often referred to by its component drugs. Several brand names are available, including Amcure-O, Audicare, Candiflox, Candistin, Oflo Plus, Otobiotic-Plus, Otic-4, and Otoxin.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

The combined effects of the individual components provide synergistic action against ear infections. Ofloxacin targets bacterial infections, clotrimazole addresses fungal infections, lidocaine provides pain relief, and beclometasone reduces inflammation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

Primarily administered as ear drops, systemic absorption is minimal.  Each component has its own pharmacokinetic profile following systemic administration:

* **Ofloxacin:** Well-absorbed orally, hepatic metabolism, renal excretion.
* **Clotrimazole:** Minimally absorbed topically, hepatic metabolism.
* **Lidocaine:** Well-absorbed topically, hepatic metabolism, renal excretion.
* **Beclometasone:** Minimally absorbed through skin, hepatic metabolism, renal excretion.


**Mode of Action:**

The pharmacodynamics and mechanisms of action are described above.
Elimination pathways are mentioned in the pharmacokinetics section.

## **Dosage**
