## **Usage**

Clotrimazole + Mometasone is prescribed for fungal skin infections such as ringworm, athlete's foot, jock itch, and other types of dermatophytoses.  It's also used for inflammatory skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**  This is a combination product containing a corticosteroid (Mometasone) and an antifungal (Clotrimazole). Thus, it is classified as a combination corticosteroid/antifungal.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Mometasone, the corticosteroid, provides anti-inflammatory, antipruritic (anti-itch), and vasoconstrictive actions. Clotrimazole exerts its antifungal effect by inhibiting ergosterol synthesis, a crucial component of fungal cell membranes, thus disrupting membrane integrity and leading to fungal cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

No commonly used alternate names or international variations exist for the combination product "Clotrimazole + Mometasone" itself. However, each component has other names: mometasone furoate and clotrimazole. Brand names vary depending on the region and manufacturer.

- **Brand Names:** Examples of brand names include  Momate-C, Clobetasone-M, and others depending on the manufacturer and country.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Mometasone reduces inflammation by binding to glucocorticoid receptors, inhibiting inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Clotrimazole affects the synthesis of ergosterol in fungal cell membranes.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Primarily topical application. Systemic absorption is minimal for both drugs when applied to intact skin. Mometasone, if absorbed, is metabolized primarily in the liver, with renal excretion. Clotrimazole is metabolized in the liver to inactive compounds and excreted in bile and feces.
- **Mode of Action:**  Mometasone binds to glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm, translocates to the nucleus, and modulates gene expression related to inflammation.  Clotrimazole inhibits the enzyme 14α-demethylase, which is involved in ergosterol synthesis.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Mometasone binds to glucocorticoid receptors. Clotrimazole inhibits 14α-demethylase.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Mometasone is primarily metabolized in the liver, with renal excretion of metabolites. Clotrimazole is metabolized in the liver and excreted mainly through bile and feces.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Apply a thin layer to the affected area once or twice daily for 2-4 weeks, depending on the condition.

#### **Children:**  Dosage should be determined by a pediatrician, considering age, weight, and specific condition.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically needed.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are generally needed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are usually required due to minimal systemic absorption.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Patients with diabetes or other conditions affecting skin integrity should be monitored closely.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  The combination is not used systemically, hence the following clinical use cases are inapplicable:
- **Intubation**  
- **Surgical Procedures**  
- **Mechanical Ventilation**  
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**  
- **Emergency Situations**  

### **Dosage Adjustments** Dosage adjustments are based on the severity and response to treatment and are best determined by the physician.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Mometasone: Anti-inflammatory and antipruritic. Clotrimazole: Inhibits ergosterol synthesis in fungal cell membranes.
- **Side Effects:** Local skin reactions (burning, stinging, itching). Rarely: allergic contact dermatitis, skin atrophy.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, rosacea, acne, viral skin infections.
- **Drug Interactions:**  No significant interactions expected with topical use.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh potential risks.
- **Dosage:** Apply a thin layer to affected area 1-2 times daily.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor the affected skin for improvement and signs of adverse reactions.

## **Popular Combinations**
