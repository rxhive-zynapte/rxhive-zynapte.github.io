## **Usage**

Clotrimazole + Selenium is a topical antifungal medication prescribed for fungal skin infections like *tinea versicolor* (a skin discoloration caused by a fungal infection), *seborrheic dermatitis* (dandruff), and other superficial mycoses.  It is categorized as an antifungal and anti-infective agent. The combination works by inhibiting fungal cell membrane synthesis, causing fungal cell death (Clotrimazole), and reducing scaling and itching while promoting skin regeneration (Selenium sulfide).

## **Alternate Names**

While no official alternate names exist for this combination drug itself, it's important to be aware that "Clotrimazole + Selenium Sulfide" is also sometimes used. Some brand names under which this medication may be marketed include Candid TV, Kansel DS and others.

## **How It Works**

* **Pharmacodynamics:**  Clotrimazole inhibits the biosynthesis of ergosterol, a crucial component of fungal cell membranes. This leads to increased membrane permeability, cell leakage, and ultimately, fungal cell death. Selenium sulfide possesses antifungal, keratolytic (exfoliating), and anti-inflammatory properties.  It works by slowing down the growth of yeast cells, removing scales, and controlling inflammation associated with the infection.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Topical absorption of both clotrimazole and selenium sulfide is minimal, resulting in low systemic exposure and reducing the risk of systemic side effects.
* **Mode of Action:** Clotrimazole alters the permeability of the fungal cell wall, leading to fungal cell death. Selenium sulfide exfoliates the *stratum corneum* (outermost layer of the skin), reduces scaling and itching, and facilitates healthy skin regeneration.
* **Elimination Pathways:**  Due to minimal systemic absorption, most of the drug is eliminated through washing off the application site.  A small amount that may be absorbed is metabolized in the liver and eliminated through renal or fecal routes.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Apply a thin layer of the cream, lotion, or solution to the affected area twice daily. The duration of treatment depends on the infection type and severity, generally ranging from two to four weeks for *tinea* infections and at least 15 days for *Candida* infections.  For seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff), apply twice weekly until symptoms are controlled, and then use weekly or less frequently as maintenance.

#### **Children:**  The dosage and frequency should be determined by a physician, based on the child's age, weight, and the specific condition being treated. Use in children younger than 2 years is generally not recommended without physician consultation.


#### **Special Cases:**
* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are usually needed, but monitor for skin irritation.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are indicated.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are indicated.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider patient-specific factors and concomitant medications.  Consult a physician if other skin conditions or systemic illnesses are present.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Clotrimazole + Selenium is not typically used in intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.  It is primarily indicated for topical treatment of specific skin conditions.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are usually not necessary. Modifications are at the physician's discretion based on individual patient factors.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Itching, dryness, redness, swelling, and burning sensation at the application site.
* Temporary hair loss (when used on the scalp).
* Hair discoloration (can be minimized by thorough rinsing).
* Oiliness or dryness of scalp and hair.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing).
* Blistering or oozing at the application site.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

No significant long-term effects are observed with recommended usage.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

* Severe allergic reactions.
* Severe skin irritation or ulceration.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to clotrimazole, selenium sulfide, or any component of the formulation.
* Broken or irritated skin at the application site.

## **Drug Interactions**

No significant drug interactions have been reported. However, the combination may damage metallic jewelry upon contact.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Consult a physician before use. Topical clotrimazole is generally considered safe, but limited data is available on selenium sulfide during pregnancy.
* **Breastfeeding:** Consult a physician before use. Limited data is available on the excretion of both components in breast milk.  Exercise caution and avoid applying to areas that may come in contact with the infant. If applying to the nipples, wash thoroughly before breastfeeding.
