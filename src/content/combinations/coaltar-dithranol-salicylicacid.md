## **Usage**

This topical medication is primarily prescribed for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis, a skin condition characterized by red, itchy, scaly patches. It can also be used for eczema.  It falls under the pharmacological classification of dermatological preparations, specifically keratolytics and antipsoriatics. The combination of ingredients works synergistically to remove dead skin cells, reduce inflammation, and slow down the excessive production of skin cells.

## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination. Brand names may vary depending on the manufacturer and region. Derobin is one such brand.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Coal Tar:**  Exerts anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and antiproliferative actions.
* **Dithranol (Anthralin):** Inhibits DNA replication in skin cells, slowing down cell growth and reducing scaling and thickening of the skin.
* **Salicylic Acid:** Acts as a keratolytic agent, breaking down keratin, softening the skin, and promoting the shedding of dead skin cells. It also has mild anti-inflammatory properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

Primarily topical application. Absorption is minimal with topical use. Small amounts of salicylic acid can be absorbed systemically. Metabolism and elimination pathways for this combination are not well-defined.

**Mode of Action:**
The drugs work together to target various aspects of psoriasis.  Dithranol slows skin cell production, while salicylic acid and coal tar break down keratin and promote exfoliation of dead skin cells. Coal tar also has anti-inflammatory and anti-itch effects.
