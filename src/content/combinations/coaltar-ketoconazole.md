## **Usage**

Coal Tar + Ketoconazole is a topical combination product prescribed for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff, both of which are common skin conditions affecting the scalp.  It is classified as an antifungal and keratolytic agent. Coal tar works by slowing down the growth of skin cells and removing dead skin cells from the scalp. Ketoconazole, an antifungal, inhibits the growth of *Malassezia* yeasts, which are implicated in these conditions.

## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination, although the individual components may be referred to by their generic names (coal tar solution, ketoconazole). Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and formulation (e.g., KATARINA COAL TAR, Eurosoft).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Coal tar exerts a keratolytic and antipruritic action by softening and shedding the stratum corneum and relieving itching. Ketoconazole, a broad-spectrum imidazole antifungal, disrupts the fungal cell membrane synthesis by inhibiting ergosterol production.  This leads to increased cell wall permeability and fungal cell death. 

**Pharmacokinetics:** When applied topically,  both coal tar and ketoconazole have minimal systemic absorption.  The primary site of action is the stratum corneum of the skin. Elimination pathways for absorbed components are primarily hepatic. The small amount of ketoconazole that might be absorbed is metabolized by the liver and excreted in the bile and urine.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**  
#### **Adults:** Apply 5-10ml to the wet scalp depending on hair length, massage into a lather, leave for a few minutes, and rinse thoroughly.  The frequency of application varies; two to three times per week is commonly recommended, or as directed by a physician.

#### **Children:** Use in children under 12 is generally not recommended unless directed by a pediatrician.  For children over 12, the usage and dosage should be determined by a doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are necessary due to minimal systemic absorption.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution in patients with liver disease due to the potential, albeit low, for hepatotoxicity from ketoconazole. Monitor liver function.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider pre-existing conditions such as heart conditions, particularly long QT syndrome, and asthma.


### **Clinical Use Cases** 

Coal Tar + Ketoconazole is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its usage is primarily limited to topical treatment of scalp conditions.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

No formal dosage adjustments are established based on specific factors like genetic polymorphisms. However, patients with liver disease should use this combination cautiously.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
-  Skin irritation (burning, itching, stinging, redness) at the application site
- Temporary hair discoloration
- Unpleasant odor (from coal tar)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, hives)
- Liver dysfunction (rare with topical application but requires monitoring)
- QT prolongation (rare with topical application)

### **Long-Term Effects**
- Tar acne (folliculitis) with prolonged use

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) - rare


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to coal tar, ketoconazole, or any components of the formulation
- Open wounds or severely irritated skin
- Certain liver diseases


## **Drug Interactions**

- Other topical medications applied to the same area (e.g., antifungals, corticosteroids, keratolytics) may increase irritation or decrease effectiveness.
- Some medications can increase sun sensitivity, making the scalp more prone to sunburn.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Considered Pregnancy Category C. Limited data is available. Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Minimal systemic absorption from topical application makes significant transfer into breast milk unlikely.  However,  exercise caution and discuss with a physician.
