## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Codeine + Paracetamol is prescribed for the relief of mild to moderate pain, such as postoperative pain, dental pain, headache, and musculoskeletal pain.  It may also be used to relieve pain associated with cold and flu symptoms.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Analgesic (opioid analgesic and non-opioid analgesic combination).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Codeine is an opioid analgesic that acts centrally, binding to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, reducing pain perception.  Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is a non-opioid analgesic that acts by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, reducing inflammation and pain, and acts on the hypothalamic heat-regulating center to reduce fever.

## **Alternate Names**

- Acetaminophen + Codeine
- Paracetamol + Codeine phosphate
- **Brand Names:**  (This will depend on the region. Examples include Co-codamol (UK), Tylenol with Codeine (US), and numerous other regional brand names).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Codeine acts primarily by conversion to morphine (its active metabolite) via the CYP2D6 enzyme in the liver.  Morphine binds to mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system, altering the perception of and response to pain. Paracetamol's precise mechanism is still under investigation, but it is thought to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis centrally, affecting pain and fever pathways.  It does not have significant peripheral anti-inflammatory effects.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Codeine is well-absorbed orally. It undergoes hepatic metabolism (primarily by CYP2D6) to morphine and other metabolites.  It is excreted primarily by the kidneys. Paracetamol is also well-absorbed orally. It undergoes hepatic metabolism by glucuronidation and sulfation, with a small fraction metabolized by CYP enzymes to a reactive metabolite that is usually detoxified by glutathione.  It is primarily excreted by the kidneys.
- **Receptor binding/enzyme inhibition:**  Codeine's active metabolite (morphine) primarily binds to mu-opioid receptors.  Paracetamol is thought to inhibit a variant of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, predominantly in the central nervous system.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Both codeine and paracetamol are predominantly eliminated by the kidneys, primarily as metabolites.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- One or two tablets (containing a specific strength of Codeine + Paracetamol, for example, 8/500mg, 15/500mg, 30/500mg) every four to six hours as needed for pain.
- Maximum daily dose should not exceed 8 tablets (or the equivalent amount of paracetamol and codeine) in a 24-hour period.

#### **Children:**

- **12-18 years:**  Dosage should be determined by a doctor and is based on weight, age, and clinical condition. One tablet every 6 hours, not to exceed 4-8 in 24 hours, depending on strength and clinical status.. Do not administer to obese children with breathing issues.
- **Under 12 years:** Not recommended without direct medical supervision.  Use and dose must be determined by a doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Start with lower doses and titrate cautiously due to potential age-related decreases in renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be required. Consult specialized resources for specific recommendations.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution and consider dose reduction due to impaired paracetamol metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful assessment and dose adjustment may be necessary based on the specific comorbidity. 


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of Codeine + Paracetamol in the following clinical settings should be carefully evaluated based on individual patient needs and risks, with alternative analgesics often preferred:

- **Intubation:**  Not typically used.
- **Surgical Procedures:** May be used for postoperative pain management, but other analgesics are generally preferred.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not typically used.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Not a preferred agent for pain management in ICU settings.
- **Emergency Situations:**  Not typically used.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments must be made on a patient-specific basis, considering renal function, hepatic function, age, and other factors. 



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Nausea, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Respiratory depression, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), hepatic toxicity (with paracetamol overdose).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Dependence, tolerance, opioid-induced constipation.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), severe respiratory depression, acute liver failure (paracetamol overdose).



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to codeine, paracetamol, or any component of the formulation.
- Respiratory depression, acute or severe asthma, acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- Severe liver disease.
- Concurrent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or within 14 days of stopping MAOIs.
- Use in children under 12 years old (some guidelines specify 12-18 years with respiratory compromise as contraindicated).
- Breastfeeding, especially for prolonged periods or at high doses.
- Patients who are known CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers.


## **Drug Interactions**

- CNS depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines, sedatives, hypnotics):  Increased risk of respiratory depression and sedation.
- Anticholinergic drugs: Increased risk of constipation and urinary retention.
- Drugs that affect CYP2D6 activity (inhibitors and inducers) can alter codeine metabolism and effect.
- Anticoagulants (warfarin): Paracetamol may enhance anticoagulant effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Codeine + Paracetamol can be used during pregnancy if the benefit outweighs the risks.  However, prolonged use, especially near term, should be avoided due to the risk of neonatal withdrawal.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Codeine is excreted in breast milk and may cause adverse effects in the infant, including drowsiness and respiratory depression, especially in infants of mothers who are ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine. Paracetamol is considered safer but use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration. Generally, it is recommended to avoid codeine during breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Codeine: Opioid receptor agonist (after conversion to morphine).  Paracetamol: Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis centrally.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness, dizziness; rarely, respiratory depression, allergic reactions, hepatotoxicity.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, respiratory depression, severe liver disease, concurrent MAOI use.
