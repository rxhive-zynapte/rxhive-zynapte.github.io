## **Usage**

Codeine + Triprolidine is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of dry cough associated with the common cold or upper respiratory allergies.  It is classified as a **narcotic antitussive (codeine) and antihistamine (triprolidine)** combination. Codeine acts centrally on the cough center in the brain to suppress the cough reflex. Triprolidine works by blocking the effects of histamine, relieving allergy symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Codeine + Triprolidine" represents the generic name, some common brand names include **Corex T, Cheratussin AC, and Histex-AC**. Regional variations may also exist.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Codeine, an opioid agonist, primarily acts on mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system, suppressing the cough reflex. Triprolidine, a first-generation antihistamine, competitively antagonizes the H1 histamine receptor, mitigating the effects of histamine release.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Codeine:** Codeine is well-absorbed orally. It is metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6, into morphine (its active metabolite) and other metabolites. Elimination is primarily renal.  Genetic variations in CYP2D6 activity can significantly affect codeine's efficacy and safety profile, potentially leading to reduced efficacy in poor metabolizers or toxicity in ultra-rapid metabolizers.
* **Triprolidine:** Triprolidine is also well-absorbed orally and metabolized in the liver. The exact metabolic pathways are not fully characterized. Elimination is primarily through renal excretion.

**Mode of Action:** Codeine binds to mu-opioid receptors in the medulla, reducing the sensitivity of the cough center to peripheral stimuli. Triprolidine competitively binds to H1 histamine receptors, preventing histamine from binding and exerting its effects.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Codeine - mu-opioid receptor agonist. Triprolidine - H1 receptor antagonist.

**Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion for both drugs.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 10 mL (or one tablet for formulations containing 20mg codeine/4mg triprolidine) orally every 4 to 6 hours.  Do not exceed 40 mL (or 4 tablets) in 24 hours.

#### **Children:** *Not recommended for children under 18 years of age due to the risk of serious adverse effects, including respiratory depression and death.*

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution. Start at the lower end of the dosing range due to potential age-related decline in hepatic and renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution, especially in moderate to severe impairment. Dosage adjustments may be required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dose reduction may be necessary, especially in severe impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with respiratory conditions (e.g., asthma, COPD), prostatic hypertrophy, urinary stricture, and a history of substance abuse.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Codeine + Triprolidine is *not* typically recommended for use in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its primary indication is the relief of cough associated with colds or allergies in an outpatient setting.  For pain management or sedation in these settings, other agents are generally preferred.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications should be considered in elderly patients, those with renal or hepatic impairment, and individuals with certain comorbid conditions.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, constipation, blurred vision.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Respiratory depression, allergic reactions, seizures (with excessive doses), serotonin syndrome (with concomitant serotonergic drugs).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Potential for dependence and tolerance with prolonged codeine use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, respiratory depression, serotonin syndrome.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to codeine, triprolidine, or any component of the formulation.
* Patients under 18 years of age.
* Pregnancy, labor, and delivery.
* Breastfeeding.
* Known CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers.
* Severe respiratory conditions (e.g., asthma, COPD).
* Concurrent use of MAO inhibitors.



## **Drug Interactions**

* **CNS Depressants:** Alcohol, benzodiazepines, other opioids – increased risk of respiratory depression and sedation.
* **Anticholinergics:**  Enhanced anticholinergic effects.
* **Serotonergic Drugs:** SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans – risk of serotonin syndrome.
* **CYP2D6 Inhibitors/Inducers:** Alter codeine metabolism.
* **MAO Inhibitors:**  Risk of hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy:** Contraindicated.  Codeine crosses the placenta and can cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome.

**Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.  Codeine is excreted in breast milk and poses risks to the nursing infant.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Codeine: Opioid agonist acting on the cough center. Triprolidine: H1 receptor antagonist.
* **Side Effects:** Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, respiratory depression (serious).
* **Contraindications:**  Age <18 years, pregnancy, breastfeeding, respiratory compromise, MAOI use.
* **Drug Interactions:** CNS depressants, anticholinergics, serotonergic drugs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 10 mL every 4-6 hours, not to exceed 40 mL/24h.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, mental status.


## **Popular Combinations**

Codeine is sometimes combined with other antihistamines or decongestants in cold and allergy formulations.  However, the combination of codeine, triprolidine and pseudoephedrine has been phased out in many countries due to pseudoephedrine's potential for misuse.

## **Precautions**

* Assess respiratory function before initiating therapy.
* Monitor for signs of respiratory depression, particularly in patients with pre-existing respiratory disease.
* Avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants.
* Caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.
* Risk of dependence with prolonged use.
* Avoid in patients with a history of substance abuse.
