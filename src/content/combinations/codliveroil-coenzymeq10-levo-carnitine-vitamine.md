## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to address deficiencies in the individual components. It is not a drug in the conventional sense and therefore does not have a specific pharmacological classification. Each component has its own distinct uses:

* **Cod liver oil:** Rich in omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) and vitamins A and D, it is used to supplement these nutrients.

* **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10/Ubiquinone):** An antioxidant involved in cellular energy production, sometimes used for heart health, migraine prevention, or in patients with certain diseases that may have lower CoQ10 levels.

* **Levo-carnitine (L-carnitine):** An amino acid derivative involved in fatty acid metabolism, sometimes used for carnitine deficiency, heart health, or exercise performance.

* **Vitamin E (Tocopherol):** An antioxidant that protects cells from damage, sometimes used for its potential benefits to skin health and other conditions.

## **Alternate Names**

* Cod liver oil + CoQ10 + L-carnitine + Vitamin E
* Cod liver oil + Ubiquinone + Levocarnitine + Tocopherol
* Vitamin A & D oil + Coenzyme Q10 + L-carnitine + Vitamin E

This combination is not typically marketed under a specific brand name. It is usually found as a combination of individual supplements.

## **How It Works**

### Cod Liver Oil

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Provides omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin A, and vitamin D, which have various roles in the body, including anti-inflammatory effects (omega-3s), vision and immune function (vitamin A), and bone health (vitamin D).
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Omega-3s are incorporated into cell membranes and metabolized like other fatty acids. Vitamins A and D are stored in the liver and fatty tissues.

### Coenzyme Q10

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Acts as an antioxidant and participates in electron transport chain within mitochondria, supporting cellular energy production.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Absorbed in the small intestine, peak blood levels reached in several hours, metabolized in the liver, and eliminated through bile.

### Levo-Carnitine

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Facilitates the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for energy production.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Absorbed in the small intestine, distributed throughout the body, minimally metabolized, and primarily excreted by the kidneys.

### Vitamin E

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Acts as an antioxidant, protecting cell membranes from damage.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Absorbed in the small intestine with the aid of bile salts and fats. Distributed to tissues throughout the body.  Excreted mainly via bile and partly in urine.

## **Dosage**

This combination is not a regulated pharmaceutical product, therefore standard dosage guidelines are not established. Dosage should be individualized based on patient needs and product labeling. Consultation with a healthcare professional is crucial.
