## **Usage**

This combination is primarily prescribed for **female infertility**, particularly in cases of diminished ovarian reserve, poor ovarian response during assisted reproductive technologies (IVF/ICSI/IUI), premature ovarian insufficiency, and unexplained infertility. It is also used as an adjuvant therapy in infertility treatment.  While it is not classified under a single pharmacological category, it acts as a hormonal supplement, antioxidant, and fertility enhancer. Coenzyme Q10 acts as an antioxidant and improves energy production within cells. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a precursor to sex hormones, potentially improving egg quality and ovarian function. Melatonin, also an antioxidant, may further enhance egg quality and regulate sleep-wake cycles, which can indirectly improve fertility.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination doesn't have a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN). It is often referred to by the names of its individual components. Brand names include DRONE-Q10, OVACORE,  INFERVIT SMART TAB and Ovares Plus.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Coenzyme Q10 is an antioxidant that is involved in mitochondrial energy production. DHEA is a precursor hormone that can be converted into estrogens and androgens, potentially impacting ovarian function and egg quality. Melatonin has antioxidant properties and can regulate circadian rhythms.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The individual components have distinct pharmacokinetic profiles. Coenzyme Q10 is absorbed from the gut and metabolized in the liver. DHEA is metabolized into various steroids, including estrogens and androgens. Melatonin is rapidly absorbed and metabolized primarily in the liver, with excretion through the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** Coenzyme Q10 enhances mitochondrial function and protects against oxidative stress. DHEA may improve ovarian function by increasing androgen levels, which are precursors to estrogens. Melatonin's antioxidant properties may protect oocytes from oxidative damage.
