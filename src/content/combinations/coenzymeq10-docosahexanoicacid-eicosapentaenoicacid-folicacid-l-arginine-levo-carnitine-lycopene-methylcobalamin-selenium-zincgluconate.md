## **Usage**

This combination of ingredients is primarily prescribed as a nutritional supplement to address deficiencies and support overall health. It's often used for conditions related to cardiovascular health, male infertility, antioxidant support, and energy production.  It is not classified under a single pharmacological class like antibiotics or analgesics, as it's a combination of nutrients with diverse mechanisms.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination doesn't have a single, universally recognized name other than the listing of its components. Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer. One example found online was "Carnione M Tablet."

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Coenzyme Q10:**  Plays a vital role in mitochondrial electron transport chain, crucial for cellular energy production (ATP synthesis).  Acts as an antioxidant.
* **Docosahexanoic Acid (DHA) and Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA):**  Omega-3 fatty acids with anti-inflammatory properties, benefiting cardiovascular health and brain function.
* **Folic Acid:** Essential for cell division and growth, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell formation.
* **L-Arginine:**  Precursor to nitric oxide, promoting vasodilation and improving blood flow.
* **Levo-carnitine:** Facilitates fatty acid transport into mitochondria for energy production.
* **Lycopene:**  Antioxidant that may protect against certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases.
* **Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B12):**  Crucial for nerve function, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell formation.
* **Selenium:**  Essential mineral with antioxidant properties.
* **Zinc Gluconate:**  Supports immune function, wound healing, and cell growth.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  The absorption, metabolism, and elimination of each component differ:

* CoQ10 is absorbed with lipids and metabolized in the liver.
* DHA and EPA are incorporated into cell membranes and metabolized like other fatty acids.
* Water-soluble vitamins like folic acid and B12 are absorbed in the small intestine.
* L-Arginine is metabolized primarily in the liver.
* Levo-carnitine is absorbed in the small intestine.
* Lycopene is absorbed with lipids and accumulates in various tissues.
* Selenium is metabolized and excreted in urine.
* Zinc is absorbed in the small intestine and excreted primarily in feces.

**Mode of Action:**  This combination works through various mechanisms like enzyme co-factor activity (e.g., zinc, selenium, B12), antioxidant effects (CoQ10, lycopene, selenium), facilitating energy production (CoQ10, L-carnitine, DHA/EPA), and promoting vasodilation (L-arginine).
