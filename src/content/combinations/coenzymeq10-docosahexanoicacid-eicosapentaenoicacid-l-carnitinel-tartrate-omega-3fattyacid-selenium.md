## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to support overall health, particularly cardiovascular health, cellular energy production, and antioxidant defense. It is not a prescribed drug for treating specific diseases but rather addresses nutritional deficiencies and promotes general well-being.

It does not fall under a single pharmacological classification but its components can be categorized as antioxidants, metabolic agents, and essential fatty acids.

The purported benefits arise from the synergistic effects of its components:

* **Cardiovascular Health:** CoQ10, omega-3 fatty acids, and selenium support heart health by potentially improving blood lipid profiles and endothelial function. L-carnitine may enhance energy production in cardiac muscle.
* **Energy Production:** CoQ10 and L-carnitine play crucial roles in cellular energy production, especially within the mitochondria.
* **Antioxidant Protection:** CoQ10, selenium, and omega-3 fatty acids exhibit antioxidant properties, protecting cells from oxidative stress and damage.
* **Brain Health:** DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid, is a vital component of brain tissue and may support cognitive function.
* **Immune Function:** Selenium is essential for immune system function.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination, being a blend of nutritional supplements, lacks a single established international nonproprietary name (INN) or official alternate name. Each ingredient, however, has its own alternate names:

* **Coenzyme Q10:** Ubiquinone, Ubidecarenone, CoQ10
* **Docosahexanoic acid (DHA):** Cervonic acid, C22:6n-3
* **Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA):** Timnodonic acid, C20:5n-3
* **L-Carnitine L-Tartrate:** LCLT, Vitamin BT
* **Omega-3 fatty acids:** n-3 fatty acids, Ï‰-3 fatty acids
* **Selenium:** Elemental selenium

Some brand names this combination or similar formulations may be marketed under: Maxpalm Q, QCYG 10, Quventor, Ubigen, Vascorac-MX, Amyforte, ULTIGUARD LQ10, Ubqnine, Lycology Q10, Lycology Max.  Please note that the specific composition may differ between brand names.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** This combination exerts its effects through the combined actions of its individual components. CoQ10 acts as an electron carrier in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, supporting ATP synthesis.  L-carnitine facilitates fatty acid transport into mitochondria for energy production. Omega-3 fatty acids can influence cell membrane fluidity, and eicosanoid production which in turn may have anti-inflammatory effects. Selenium functions as a cofactor for antioxidant enzymes.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The absorption, metabolism, and elimination of each component vary. CoQ10 absorption can be enhanced by fats and is metabolized in the liver. L-carnitine is absorbed in the small intestine and primarily eliminated renally. Omega-3 fatty acids follow lipid absorption pathways, are metabolized similarly to other fatty acids, and excreted through bile and urine. Selenium is absorbed effectively and excreted in urine.

**Mode of Action:** CoQ10 participates in electron transport within the mitochondria, contributing to ATP production. L-carnitine helps transport long-chain fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane. Omega-3 fatty acids and selenium may exert their antioxidant effects through various pathways.


## **Dosage**

Due to the lack of standardized clinical trials on this specific combination, there is no universally recommended dosage regimen.  Dosage should be individualized based on patient needs, health status, and the specific product formulation. Consulting a physician is crucial for determining appropriate dosages, particularly for patients with pre-existing conditions or those taking other medications.



### **Standard Dosage**

There is no standard pharmaceutical dosage. It is crucial to consult a healthcare professional to determine appropriate dosages based on individual patient needs and the specific product formulation.

#### **Adults:**

Dosage varies depending on the specific product and individual patient needs.  A physician should be consulted for appropriate dosage recommendations.

#### **Children:**

Use in children should be under the guidance of a pediatrician or healthcare professional.

#### **Special Cases:**

Dosage adjustments may be needed for elderly patients, those with renal or hepatic impairment, or those with comorbid conditions. This should be determined by a healthcare professional after a thorough assessment of the patient's condition.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

There are no established dosage recommendations for this specific combination in specific clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary use is as a nutritional supplement.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage modifications should be individualized based on patient-specific factors such as renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism. Consulting a healthcare professional is crucial for making appropriate dose adjustments.


## **Side Effects**
