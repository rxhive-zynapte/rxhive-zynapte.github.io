## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to support overall health, particularly cardiovascular health, brain function, and healthy aging. It may also be used adjunctively in cases of male infertility.  It addresses nutritional deficiencies and helps manage high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, cognitive decline, and age-related vision loss. It does *not* belong to a single pharmacological classification, as it is a combination of nutritional supplements.

The mechanism of action involves synergistic effects of the individual components. Coenzyme Q10 is essential for cellular energy production and acts as an antioxidant. Docosahexanoic acid (DHA) and Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are omega-3 fatty acids crucial for brain health and with anti-inflammatory effects. Lycopene, a potent antioxidant, protects cells from free radical damage. Selenium supports antioxidant enzyme function.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination doesn't have a standard international nonproprietary name. It is often referred to by its component names or brand names, which can vary depending on the manufacturer. Some examples of brand names include  Enerj Q, COQFINE, and SISCUTEN. Other brand names may also exist.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The combined effects result from the individual actions of each component. CoQ10 enhances cellular energy production and acts as an antioxidant. DHA and EPA support brain health, reduce inflammation, and improve cardiovascular health. Lycopene provides antioxidant protection. Selenium enhances the activity of antioxidant enzymes.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Absorption, metabolism, and elimination vary for each component. CoQ10 absorption is enhanced by fats and can be affected by certain medications.  DHA and EPA are metabolized in the liver. Lycopene absorption is improved with dietary fats. Selenium is excreted primarily in urine.  Specific details about receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation for this combination are not available. Elimination pathways are primarily hepatic and renal.
