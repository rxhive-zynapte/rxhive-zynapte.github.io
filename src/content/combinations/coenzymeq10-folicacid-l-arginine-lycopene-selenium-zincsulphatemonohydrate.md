## **Usage**

This combination of nutrients is primarily prescribed for nutritional deficiencies and as a dietary supplement to support overall health and well-being.  It is often used to support cardiovascular health, boost immunity, protect against oxidative stress, and promote reproductive health. Specifically, it is indicated for conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, brain disorders, and abnormal cholesterol levels. Other potential uses include promoting skin health, enhancing athletic performance and recovery, and potentially improving sperm parameters in men.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Nutritional Supplement, Antioxidant

- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination works synergistically through multiple pathways: CoQ10 enhances mitochondrial energy production and acts as an antioxidant. Folic acid is crucial for DNA synthesis and cell division. L-arginine increases nitric oxide, leading to vasodilation. Lycopene, selenium, and zinc act as antioxidants, protecting cells from oxidative damage.

## **Alternate Names**

No specific alternate names exist for this exact combination, as it's typically identified by its constituent components. Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer (e.g., Oxigem-Q10, QBlend, Coenjoy-100, COADD Q10 PLUS, Lyco Q).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** CoQ10 enhances ATP production within mitochondria and exerts antioxidant effects. Folic acid participates in DNA synthesis and cell division. L-arginine increases nitric oxide, leading to vasodilation. Lycopene, selenium, and zinc contribute to antioxidant defense.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Each component has its own pharmacokinetic profile:
    - CoQ10: Absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, metabolized in the liver, eliminated through bile.
    - Folic acid: Absorbed in the small intestine, metabolized in the liver, excreted renally.
    - L-arginine: Absorbed in the small intestine, metabolized in the liver, excreted renally.
    - Lycopene: Absorbed with fats, metabolized in the liver, excreted in bile and urine.
    - Selenium: Absorbed in the small intestine, excreted in urine and feces.
    - Zinc: Absorbed in the small intestine, excreted mainly in feces.

- **Mode of Action:** CoQ10 acts within the mitochondrial electron transport chain.  Folic acid functions as a coenzyme in various metabolic processes.  L-arginine is a substrate for nitric oxide synthase. Lycopene, selenium, and zinc act as free radical scavengers.

- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** This combination does not directly bind to specific receptors, inhibit specific enzymes, or modulate neurotransmitters in the classical sense.  Its effects are primarily through its influence on metabolic pathways and antioxidant activity.
