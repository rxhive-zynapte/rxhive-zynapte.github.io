## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to support overall health, with a particular focus on cardiovascular health, cellular energy production, and antioxidant defense.  It is not classified under a specific pharmacological class like antibiotics or analgesics, but rather comprises individual components, each with its own mechanism of action.  It may be prescribed for conditions like statin-induced myopathy (muscle pain caused by cholesterol-lowering drugs),  infertility (in males), and as an adjunctive therapy in various conditions where these nutrients might be deficient.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no officially recognized alternate names for this specific combination.  However, variations referring to the individual components may exist.  Brand names include Ubigen, Vascorac-MX, Starich Q10, and others.  It's crucial to confirm the exact composition when using different brand names, as the amounts of each component can vary.

## **How It Works**

This combination product works through the synergistic actions of its individual components.

* **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10):**  This is an antioxidant vital for cellular energy production within the mitochondria. It participates in the electron transport chain and helps generate ATP, the body's primary energy currency.  It's also involved in regenerating other antioxidants like Vitamin E.
* **L-Arginine:** This amino acid is a precursor to nitric oxide, which promotes vasodilation and improves blood flow. It may also play a role in hormone production and immune function.
* **L-Carnitine L-Tartrate:**  This compound facilitates the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria for energy production.  It is important for muscle function and energy metabolism.
* **Lycopene:** A potent antioxidant carotenoid, lycopene protects cells from damage caused by free radicals.  It may offer specific benefits for prostate health.
* **Methylcobalamin:** This is the active form of vitamin B12, essential for nerve function, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell formation. It's also involved in energy production.
* **Omega-3 fatty acids:** These essential fatty acids (EPA and DHA) have anti-inflammatory properties and are crucial for brain health, cardiovascular health, and immune function.
* **Selenium dioxide:** An essential trace mineral with antioxidant properties.  It supports thyroid function and helps protect against cell damage.


**Pharmacokinetics:** The individual components have different absorption, metabolism, and elimination pathways.  CoQ10 is absorbed with fats and metabolized in the liver.  L-arginine is absorbed in the small intestine and metabolized primarily in the liver. L-carnitine is absorbed in the small intestine and eliminated by the kidneys. Lycopene is absorbed with fats and accumulates in various tissues. Methylcobalamin is absorbed in the ileum and stored in the liver. Omega-3 fatty acids are absorbed in the small intestine. Selenium is absorbed in the small intestine and excreted mainly in urine.
