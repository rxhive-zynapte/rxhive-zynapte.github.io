## **Usage**

This combination of ingredients is primarily used as a dietary supplement to support male fertility and overall health.  It is often prescribed for men with fertility issues like low sperm count or motility.  It may also be used to address general nutritional deficiencies.  While each component has individual pharmacological classifications, the combination itself doesn't fall neatly into one category. It acts as an antioxidant,  supports energy production, and potentially improves circulatory health.


## **Alternate Names**

This specific combination doesn't have a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN). It's usually referred to by its constituent ingredients. Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and formulation.  One example from the source is "Fertcare M".  Aciq is also a mentioned brand, but the formulation is slightly different.



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Coenzyme Q10:** Acts as an antioxidant and participates in mitochondrial electron transport chain, crucial for cellular energy production.
* **L-Arginine:**  Precursor to nitric oxide, promoting vasodilation and potentially improving blood flow. May also play a role in spermatogenesis.
* **Levo-carnitine:** Facilitates fatty acid transport into mitochondria for energy production. Important for sperm motility and function.
* **Lycopene:**  Antioxidant, protecting cells from oxidative stress.
* **Methylcobalamin:** Active form of vitamin B12, crucial for nerve function, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell production.
* **Selenium:**  Essential trace mineral with antioxidant properties. Important for sperm health and motility.
* **Vitamin E:**  Antioxidant, protecting cell membranes from damage.
* **Zinc:** Essential mineral for reproductive health, supporting testosterone production and sperm development.


**Pharmacokinetics:**

The individual components have different absorption, metabolism, and elimination profiles.  Generally, these components are absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract.  Metabolism varies, with some components undergoing hepatic metabolism. Elimination pathways involve both renal and hepatic routes.  The exact pharmacokinetic interaction of the combined formulation is not explicitly studied.
