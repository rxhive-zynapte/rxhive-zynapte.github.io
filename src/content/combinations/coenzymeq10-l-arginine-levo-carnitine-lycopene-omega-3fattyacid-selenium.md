## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as a dietary supplement to support overall health and address specific deficiencies. It is often marketed for male and female infertility, as well as a supplement for conditions like migraine, aging, fibromyalgia, and diabetes.  It is not classified as a drug in the traditional sense (e.g., antibiotic, analgesic), but rather as a nutritional supplement.  The components work synergistically to improve mitochondrial function, reduce oxidative stress, and enhance energy production.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination does not have a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN). It is often referred to by the names of its individual components. Brand names include QUTONE-10 and others.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Coenzyme Q10:**  An essential component of the electron transport chain in mitochondria, crucial for ATP synthesis.  Acts as an antioxidant.
* **L-Arginine:**  A precursor to nitric oxide, which promotes vasodilation and improves blood flow.  Plays a role in protein synthesis and hormone regulation.
* **Levo-carnitine:**  Facilitates the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for energy production.
* **Lycopene:**  A potent antioxidant carotenoid that may protect against cellular damage.
* **Omega-3 fatty acids:**  Possess anti-inflammatory properties and may contribute to cardiovascular health.
* **Selenium:** An essential trace mineral with antioxidant properties. It is a cofactor for several enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase, which protects cells from oxidative damage.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  The absorption, metabolism, and elimination of each component differ:

* **Coenzyme Q10:** Absorbed in the small intestine, metabolized in the liver, and primarily eliminated in feces.
* **L-Arginine:** Absorbed in the small intestine, metabolized primarily in the liver, and excreted in the urine.
* **Levo-carnitine:** Absorbed in the small intestine and eliminated primarily unchanged in urine.
* **Lycopene:** Absorbed with fats in the small intestine and stored in various tissues, including adipose tissue, liver, and prostate. Elimination occurs through bile and urine.
* **Omega-3 fatty acids:** Absorbed in the small intestine, incorporated into cell membranes, and metabolized in the liver. Elimination occurs through bile and urine.
* **Selenium:** Absorption occurs primarily in the small intestine. Metabolism involves incorporation into selenoproteins, and elimination occurs through urine and feces.
