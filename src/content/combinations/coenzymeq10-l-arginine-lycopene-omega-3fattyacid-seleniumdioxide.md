## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as a dietary supplement to support overall health, particularly cardiovascular health, and to address nutritional deficiencies. It is not classified as a drug and lacks a specific pharmacological classification.  The components work synergistically to provide antioxidant benefits, improve cardiovascular function, enhance energy production, and support immune function.


## **Alternate Names**

This combination does not have a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN).  It is typically referred to by its component names. Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer (e.g., Starich Q10, KQ-100, others).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10):**  Essential for mitochondrial function and energy production. Acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from oxidative stress.
* **L-Arginine:** Precursor to nitric oxide, promoting vasodilation and improving blood flow.  May also stimulate growth hormone release.
* **Lycopene:** A potent antioxidant carotenoid, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals.
* **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:**  Exhibit anti-inflammatory effects and may improve lipid profiles, contributing to cardiovascular health.
* **Selenium Dioxide:** Essential trace mineral with antioxidant properties, supporting immune function and protecting against cell damage.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Absorption, metabolism, and elimination data for this specific combination are not readily available. Information on individual components suggests oral absorption with varying bioavailability.  CoQ10 is metabolized in the liver, L-arginine primarily in the liver and kidneys, lycopene is absorbed with fats and metabolized in the liver, omega-3 fatty acids are absorbed in the small intestine, and selenium is excreted in urine and feces. Specific CYP enzyme involvement and elimination pathways for the combined product require further investigation.
