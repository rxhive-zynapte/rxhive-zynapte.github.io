## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as a dietary supplement to support overall health, particularly cardiovascular health, and to address nutritional deficiencies. It is not classified as a drug and thus does not have a specific pharmacological classification.  Each component contributes to various physiological processes:

* **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10):** Supports cellular energy production and acts as an antioxidant.
* **L-Arginine:**  A precursor to nitric oxide, supporting vascular health.
* **Omega-3 fatty acids:** Possess anti-inflammatory properties and contribute to cardiovascular and brain health.
* **Selenium:** An essential mineral with antioxidant properties.
* **Zinc Oxide:** Supports immune function and wound healing.

## **Alternate Names**

* CoQ10 + L-Arginine + Omega-3 + Selenium + Zinc Oxide
* Ubiquinone + L-Arginine + n-3 Fatty Acids + Selenium + Zinc Oxide
* Coenzyme Q10/L-Arginine/Omega-3 Fatty Acid/Selenium/Zinc Oxide Combination

Some brand names under which similar combinations are marketed include Cadiverge Q 10, Gyrovit 300, Q-Zim-Q Forte, Zedvion Gold, MKQ 10, STARICH Q10, and Bio Coq Forte.  Please note that formulations may vary between brands.

## **How It Works**

**CoQ10:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:**  CoQ10 is involved in mitochondrial electron transport and ATP synthesis. It also functions as an antioxidant, protecting cells from oxidative damage.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Absorbed primarily in the small intestine, CoQ10 reaches peak plasma levels in approximately 4-6 hours.  It is metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted in bile.

**L-Arginine:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** L-Arginine is a precursor to nitric oxide (NO), which causes vasodilation, improving blood flow.  It is also involved in hormone secretion and immune function.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Absorbed in the small intestine, L-Arginine undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver. It is excreted primarily in the urine.

**Omega-3 Fatty Acids:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, have anti-inflammatory effects, reducing triglyceride levels, and may improve cardiovascular health.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Absorbed in the small intestine, omega-3 fatty acids are incorporated into cell membranes and metabolized in the liver.

**Selenium:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Selenium is a component of selenoproteins, many of which function as antioxidants. It is also involved in thyroid hormone metabolism and immune function.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Absorbed in the small intestine, selenium is distributed throughout the body and excreted primarily in the urine.


**Zinc Oxide:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Zinc is essential for immune function, wound healing, and cell growth. Zinc oxide also has topical applications due to its protective and astringent properties.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Absorbed in the small intestine, zinc is stored primarily in bone and muscle.  It is excreted primarily in feces.
