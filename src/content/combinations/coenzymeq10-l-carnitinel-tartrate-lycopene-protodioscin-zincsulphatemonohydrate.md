## **Usage**

This combination is primarily prescribed as a dietary supplement to improve male reproductive health, particularly in cases of idiopathic oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (iOAT) and asthenozoospermia.  It may also be used to support muscle health, recovery from sports injuries, and immune function.  It does *not* have a formal pharmacological classification as it is not classified as a drug.

It works by providing nutritional support for sperm production and function.

## **Alternate Names**

No official alternate names exist for this specific combination.  Brand names may vary depending on the manufacturer. LINQ 10 and Progenix are examples of marketed brand names.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  This combination product exerts its effects through the synergistic action of its components.  L-Carnitine facilitates fatty acid transport into the mitochondria for energy production, which is crucial for sperm motility. Coenzyme Q10 acts as an antioxidant and participates in mitochondrial electron transport, also contributing to energy production. Lycopene, another antioxidant, protects sperm cells from oxidative stress-induced damage.  Protodioscin, derived from plants like Tribulus terrestris, has been traditionally used to improve male fertility. Zinc is essential for various physiological processes, including reproductive health.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The individual components have different pharmacokinetic profiles. L-carnitine is absorbed in the small intestine and transported to tissues, including the testes.  Coenzyme Q10 absorption can be variable and is enhanced by the presence of fats. Lycopene is a fat-soluble carotenoid absorbed better with dietary fats.  Protodioscin metabolism is not well-defined. Zinc is absorbed in the small intestine and distributed to various tissues.  Elimination pathways vary for each component, primarily through renal or hepatic routes.

**Mode of Action:**  The individual components target different aspects of sperm function. L-carnitine and Coenzyme Q10 improve sperm motility by boosting energy production.  Antioxidants like lycopene and Coenzyme Q10 protect sperm from oxidative damage, thereby improving sperm quality. Protodioscin is believed to have hormonal and spermatogenic effects.  Zinc is essential for sperm development and function.
