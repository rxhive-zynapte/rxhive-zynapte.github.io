## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to address nutritional deficiencies, support male fertility, and improve overall health and well-being. It is prescribed for conditions like male infertility, chronic prostatitis, and as an adjunctive therapy for various health concerns like heart health, brain function, and muscle movement.  It's also used to treat Coenzyme Q10 and L-carnitine deficiencies. This combination is not classified under a single pharmacological class but acts as an antioxidant, metabolic agent, and nutritional supplement.

## **Alternate Names**

CoQ10 + L-Carnitine L-Tartrate + Lycopene + Zinc Oxide; Ubiquinone + Levocarnitine L-Tartrate + Lycopene + Zinc Oxide. Several brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and specific formulation.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10):**  A potent antioxidant, protecting cells from free radical damage.  It is crucial for mitochondrial function and ATP production, supporting cellular energy.
* **L-Carnitine L-Tartrate:** Facilitates the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation and energy production. May improve sperm motility and morphology.
* **Lycopene:** An antioxidant carotenoid, protects against oxidative stress, potentially improving sperm parameters.
* **Zinc Oxide:** Essential for reproductive health, contributing to sperm production, testosterone synthesis, and immune function.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

Absorption, metabolism, and elimination data for the combined product are limited. Information is generally based on individual components. CoQ10 is absorbed with fats and metabolized in the liver. L-carnitine is absorbed in the small intestine and eliminated renally. Lycopene is absorbed with fats and metabolized in the liver. Zinc is absorbed in the small intestine and excreted primarily in feces.
