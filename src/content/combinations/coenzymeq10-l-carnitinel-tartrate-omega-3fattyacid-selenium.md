## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to support overall health and address deficiencies in the individual components.  It is often recommended for conditions like:

* **Cardiovascular disease:** The components support heart health, improve blood flow, and act as antioxidants.
* **Diabetes:** May help manage blood sugar levels and reduce oxidative stress.
* **Neurological disorders:** Certain components support nerve function and cognitive health.
* **Hyperlipidemia:** Omega-3 fatty acids can help regulate cholesterol levels.
* **Age-related decline:** Antioxidants protect against cellular damage.
* **Male infertility:** Improves sperm quality parameters.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Nutritional supplement, antioxidant, metabolic agent.

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination works through the synergistic actions of its components: CoQ10 enhances mitochondrial function and acts as an antioxidant, L-carnitine facilitates fatty acid transport for energy production, Omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory effects and improve the lipid profile, and Selenium acts as an antioxidant and supports thyroid and immune function.


## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication lacks a standardized international nonproprietary name (INN). It's marketed under various brand names (e.g., QUTONE-10, Lycology Q10 Softgel, Qbisan). Some manufacturers may use names highlighting specific components (e.g.,  "CoQ10-L-Carnitine-Omega-3 Complex"). Individual components have alternate names like ubiquinone (CoQ10), ubiquinol (CoQ10), levocarnitine L-tartrate (L-Carnitine L-Tartrate), EPA and DHA (Omega-3 fatty acids), and sodium selenite (Selenium).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The combined effects of CoQ10, L-carnitine, Omega-3 fatty acids, and selenium contribute to improved cellular energy production, antioxidant protection, and reduced inflammation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Each component has its own absorption profile. CoQ10 is better absorbed with fats. L-carnitine absorption can vary. Omega-3 absorption is generally efficient. Selenium is well-absorbed.
* **Metabolism:** CoQ10 is metabolized in the liver. L-carnitine is not extensively metabolized. Omega-3s can be metabolized to active metabolites like EPA and DHA. Selenium is incorporated into selenoproteins.
* **Elimination:** CoQ10 metabolites are primarily eliminated through bile. L-carnitine is mainly excreted unchanged in urine. Omega-3 metabolites are excreted through bile and urine. Selenium is excreted in urine.


**Mode of Action:**

* **CoQ10:**  Electron carrier in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, crucial for ATP production; acts as an antioxidant.
* **L-Carnitine:** Transports long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation and energy production; may improve insulin sensitivity and reduce exercise-induced muscle damage.
* **Omega-3 Fatty Acids:** Incorporated into cell membranes, affecting fluidity and receptor function;  exert anti-inflammatory effects by modulating eicosanoid pathways.
* **Selenium:** Incorporated into selenoproteins, including antioxidant enzymes like glutathione peroxidase, which neutralize free radicals.
