## **Usage**

- This combination is prescribed for nutritional deficiencies, particularly in the context of male infertility. It is also used to improve sperm parameters such as count and motility.  It may also be used to manage conditions related to heart disease, enhance athletic performance, support male fertility, and improve skin health.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Nutritional supplement, Antioxidant.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination works by providing essential nutrients and antioxidants that support various bodily functions. Coenzyme Q10 is involved in cellular energy production and acts as an antioxidant. Levo-carnitine helps transport fatty acids for energy production and improves sperm motility. Lycopene, a potent antioxidant, protects cells from damage. Zinc is essential for reproductive health, immune function, and cell growth.

## **Alternate Names**
-  CoQ10 + L-carnitine + Lycopene + Zinc
- Zinc Oxide + L-Carnitine + Coenzyme Q10 + Lycopene
-  Ubiquinone + Levo-carnitine + Lycopene + Zinc

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Coenzyme Q10 improves cellular energy production and reduces oxidative stress. Levo-carnitine enhances fatty acid metabolism and sperm function. Lycopene acts as a potent antioxidant, protecting cells from free radical damage. Zinc supports reproductive health, immune function, and various enzymatic processes.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Absorption: All components are absorbed orally, though absorption can vary.  CoQ10 is best absorbed with fatty meals.
    - Metabolism:  CoQ10 is primarily metabolized in the liver. Levo-carnitine is minimally metabolized. Lycopene undergoes isomerization and metabolism. Zinc is bound to proteins and distributed throughout the body.
    - Elimination: The components are eliminated through various pathways, including renal and hepatic excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** This combination supports cellular function and protects against oxidative stress. CoQ10 enhances mitochondrial function. Levo-carnitine facilitates fatty acid transport into mitochondria for energy production. Lycopene scavenges free radicals. Zinc is a cofactor for various enzymes.
