## **Usage**

This combination is primarily prescribed as a nutritional supplement to address deficiencies in Coenzyme Q10, Levo-carnitine, and Lycopene. It's also used for conditions like male infertility, cardiovascular health support, and improved energy levels.  It is not classified under a single pharmacological classification, as it is a combination of naturally occurring substances with individual mechanisms. Coenzyme Q10 is an antioxidant, Levo-carnitine aids in fatty acid metabolism, and Lycopene acts as an antioxidant.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination doesn't have a universally recognized alternate name. Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and specific formulation.  Some formulations also include additional ingredients like zinc and astaxanthin.

## **How It Works**

**Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10):**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** CoQ10 is an essential component of the electron transport chain in mitochondria, playing a crucial role in ATP production. It also functions as an antioxidant.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** CoQ10 is absorbed in the small intestine, metabolized in the liver, and primarily excreted in bile.

**Levo-carnitine (L-carnitine):**

* **Pharmacodynamics:**  L-carnitine facilitates the transport of long-chain fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane for beta-oxidation and energy production.
* **Pharmacokinetics:**  Absorbed in the small intestine, distributed throughout the body, and excreted primarily by the kidneys.

**Lycopene:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** A potent antioxidant, protecting cells from oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Absorbed with dietary fats in the small intestine, metabolized in the liver, and eliminated through bile and urine.
