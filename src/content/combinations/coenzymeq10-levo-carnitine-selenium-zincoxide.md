## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to address deficiencies in Coenzyme Q10, L-carnitine, Selenium, and Zinc. It's often prescribed for male infertility, as these nutrients play crucial roles in sperm production and function. It may also be used to support heart function, enhance cellular energy production, and provide antioxidant support.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Nutritional supplement.

- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination works through the synergistic actions of its components:
    - *Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10):*  A vital component of the electron transport chain in mitochondria, crucial for ATP (energy) production. It also has antioxidant properties.
    - *Levo-carnitine (L-carnitine):* Facilitates the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria for energy production.  It also plays a role in sperm motility and function.
    - *Selenium:* An essential trace mineral and cofactor for antioxidant enzymes, contributing to overall cellular health.
    - *Zinc Oxide:* Essential for cell growth, development, and reproductive health, contributing to testicular development and sperm formation.


## **Alternate Names**

- CoQ10 + L-carnitine + Selenium + Zinc Oxide
- Ubiquinone + Levocarnitine + Selenium + Zinc Oxide
- Coenzyme Q10 + L-carnitine + Selenium + Zinc

Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and formulation.  This information was not available in the provided sources.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The combined effects are achieved through the individual actions of each component, contributing to improved energy production, antioxidant protection, and sperm health.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of this combined supplement vary for each component.
    - *CoQ10:* Absorbed with lipids, metabolized in the liver, and primarily excreted in bile.
    - *L-carnitine:* Absorbed in the small intestine, distributed widely, and excreted primarily unchanged in urine.
    - *Selenium:* Absorbed in the small intestine, metabolized in the liver, and excreted in urine and feces.
    - *Zinc Oxide:* Absorbed in the small intestine, primarily bound to albumin, and excreted mainly in feces.

- **Mode of Action (Cellular/Molecular):**  CoQ10 participates in the electron transport chain within mitochondria. L-carnitine transports fatty acids into mitochondria for beta-oxidation. Selenium acts as a cofactor for glutathione peroxidase, an antioxidant enzyme. Zinc is involved in numerous enzymatic processes and contributes to structural integrity.

- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Limited information from the sources provided.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly renal and hepatic pathways.
