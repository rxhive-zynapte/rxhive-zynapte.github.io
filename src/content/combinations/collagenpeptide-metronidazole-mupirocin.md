## **Usage**

This topical medication is primarily prescribed for bacterial skin infections, such as impetigo and infected wounds. It is also used to treat non-healing wound ulcers (diabetic foot ulcers, venous ulcers, pressure ulcers), and various other wound types (surgical wounds, open fractures, tunnel/fissure wounds, traumatic wounds).

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic, Wound Healing Agent

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination product works through the synergistic action of its three components:

* **Metronidazole:** A nitroimidazole antimicrobial that disrupts bacterial DNA synthesis and exhibits bactericidal action, effectively killing bacteria.
* **Mupirocin:**  An antibacterial agent that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, preventing bacterial growth.
* **Collagen Peptide:** Facilitates wound healing by forming a collagen matrix that aids in building granulation tissue and supports epithelialization (skin repair).


## **Alternate Names**

* Mupirocin + Metronidazole + Collagen Peptide
* Several brand names exist, including Biofil-AB Particles, Colatage M Particles, Enzomac CM Particles, KolaHeal-M Particles, and M2-Bact Particles.  

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Metronidazole enters bacterial cells and damages their DNA, leading to bacterial death. Mupirocin inhibits bacterial isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, halting bacterial protein synthesis and thus, growth. Collagen promotes cell migration and proliferation at the wound site, accelerating wound closure.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Metronidazole is minimally absorbed systemically with topical application. Mupirocin is also minimally absorbed after topical application.  Collagen peptide acts locally at the wound site.
* **Metabolism:** Systemically absorbed metronidazole is metabolized in the liver. Absorbed mupirocin is rapidly metabolized to inactive monic acid.
* **Elimination:** Metronidazole is primarily excreted by the kidneys. Monic acid and any unmetabolized mupirocin are excreted in the urine.  Topically applied mupirocin is largely removed through the natural shedding of skin cells.

**Mode of Action:**

* Metronidazole:  Disrupts bacterial DNA synthesis.
* Mupirocin: Inhibits bacterial isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, an enzyme crucial for bacterial protein synthesis.
* Collagen: Promotes fibroblast activity and stimulates the formation of new connective tissue, contributing to tissue repair.

## **Dosage**


Dosage guidelines should be determined by a physician based on the specific infection and the patient's condition.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** A thin layer applied to the affected area 2-3 times daily, or as directed by a physician.

#### **Children:** Use in children should be under the guidance of a physician.

#### **Special Cases:** Due to minimal systemic absorption, dose adjustment is typically not necessary in elderly patients, patients with renal impairment, or those with hepatic dysfunction. However, caution is advised in patients with severe liver or kidney disease. For patients with comorbid conditions, a physician should assess the overall clinical picture before prescribing.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage and frequency of application for specific clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations should be determined by the attending physician based on the patient's specific needs and condition.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications might be necessary for patients with hypersensitivity, severe liver/kidney disease, or blood disorders.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Itching, burning, irritation, dryness, and redness at the application site are commonly reported side effects. These are usually mild and transient.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing) can occur, although rare, and require immediate medical attention.

### **Long-Term Effects**

No significant long-term adverse effects are typically associated with topical use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions are the most significant ADR and require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any of the components (metronidazole, mupirocin, collagen)
* Severe liver or kidney disease
* Blood disorders
* Cockayne syndrome


## **Drug Interactions**

* Other topical antibiotics (clindamycin, neomycin)
* Topical corticosteroids (hydrocortisone, betamethasone)
* Topical antifungals (clotrimazole, ketoconazole)
* Topical retinoids (tretinoin, adapalene)
* Antiseptic solutions (chlorhexidine, povidone-iodine)
* Skin products containing alcohol or strong astringents

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be under the guidance of a physician. Benefits versus potential risks to the fetus or infant should be carefully considered.

## **Drug Profile Summary**
