## **Usage**

- Collagen Peptide + Sodium Hyaluronate is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to support skin health, joint health, and connective tissue.  It is prescribed for conditions like osteoarthritis, wrinkles, and loss of skin elasticity.
- **Pharmacological classification:**  Nutritional supplement,  chondroprotective agent (for sodium hyaluronate).
- **Mechanism of action:** Collagen peptides provide building blocks for collagen synthesis, while sodium hyaluronate acts as a lubricant and cushion in joints, and also contributes to skin hydration.

## **Alternate Names**

-  Collagen hydrolysate + hyaluronan
- **Brand names:** Collagen30Â® with Hyaluronic Acid

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Collagen peptides stimulate fibroblast activity and collagen production, improving skin elasticity and reducing wrinkles. Sodium hyaluronate improves joint lubrication, reduces pain, and increases skin hydration by binding water molecules.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Collagen peptides are absorbed in the gut and distributed throughout the body, where they are used for collagen synthesis. Sodium hyaluronate, when taken orally, is absorbed in the digestive system and then distributed to tissues like joints and skin. When injected directly into joints, it remains localized to the synovial fluid providing lubrication and cushioning.
- **Mode of action:** Collagen peptides act as precursors for collagen synthesis in the body. Sodium hyaluronate functions as a glycosaminoglycan, binding water and contributing to the viscoelastic properties of synovial fluid and skin.
- **Elimination pathways:**  Collagen peptides are broken down into amino acids and excreted through normal metabolic pathways. Sodium hyaluronate is degraded and eliminated from the body.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Oral:  2.5 - 15 grams of collagen peptides per day, often divided into multiple doses. Sodium hyaluronate dosage varies depending on the formulation, usually ranging from 20-200 mg per day orally.
