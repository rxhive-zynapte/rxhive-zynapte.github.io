## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as a dietary supplement to address nutritional deficiencies in individuals who may not obtain adequate amounts of these nutrients from their diet. It is prescribed to support overall health and wellness by supplementing essential vitamins and minerals.  It is not categorized under a single pharmacological class, but rather as a nutritional supplement.  The mechanism of action involves providing the body with essential nutrients to support various physiological functions.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination does not have a universally recognized international non-proprietary name (INN). It is often marketed under various brand names (e.g., Liftofit) and may be referred to simply as a multivitamin/multimineral supplement with L-Lysine and Lycopene.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The effects on the body are primarily based on the individual components' functions: copper supports iron absorption and bone health; folic acid is essential for cell growth and red blood cell production; L-lysine aids tissue repair and immune function; lycopene acts as an antioxidant; manganese contributes to bone health and metabolism; potassium iodide supports thyroid function; selenious acid is an antioxidant supporting immune and thyroid health; vitamin B12 is crucial for nerve function and red blood cell production; vitamin B6 supports metabolic processes; vitamin D3 is essential for calcium absorption and bone health; and zinc sulfate monohydrate supports immune function and cell growth.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The absorption, metabolism, and elimination of each component vary.  Water-soluble vitamins like B6, B12, and folic acid are absorbed directly into the bloodstream, while fat-soluble vitamins like D3 require bile salts for absorption. Minerals are absorbed through various mechanisms in the digestive tract. Elimination occurs through renal and hepatic pathways, depending on the specific component.  The precise mechanisms of action at a cellular level, receptor binding, or enzyme interactions are not fully characterized for this combination product as a whole.  Similarly, specific details regarding CYP enzyme metabolism are not available for this combination.

## **Dosage**

The dosage of this combination supplement can vary based on individual needs and the specific product formulation.  It is crucial to follow the instructions provided on the product label or as directed by a healthcare professional.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

A typical dosage might be one capsule or tablet per day, or as prescribed by a physician.  Always refer to the specific product label for dosage recommendations.

#### **Children:**

Dosage recommendations for children should be determined by a pediatrician or healthcare provider. Itâ€™s essential to consider the child's age, weight, and health condition. Pediatric safety considerations should include avoiding exceeding the recommended dose and ensuring the child doesn't have any allergies to the components.

#### **Special Cases:**

Dosage adjustments are crucial in special cases:

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments might be necessary based on individual health, kidney and liver function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction might be required, depending on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Similar to renal impairment, adjustments might be required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Pre-existing conditions should be assessed for potential interactions or contraindications.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This specific combination is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use. It primarily serves as a nutritional supplement rather than a therapeutic intervention in acute medical scenarios. In emergency situations, specific treatments tailored to the medical condition will take precedence.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary based on patient-specific factors such as renal or hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms.  Always consider individual patient needs and consult with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate dose.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Generally well-tolerated when taken as directed.  Some individuals might experience mild gastrointestinal discomfort like nausea or constipation.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions to any component are possible, though rare.  Seek immediate medical attention if any signs of allergy occur.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Limited data are available on long-term effects.  Regular monitoring of nutrient levels is recommended during prolonged use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs are rare when taken as directed.  However, high doses of certain components, like zinc or selenium, can have adverse effects.


## **Contraindications**

Individuals with known hypersensitivity to any of the components should avoid this supplement.  Specific contraindications related to pre-existing conditions should be assessed on a case-by-case basis by a healthcare professional.

## **Drug Interactions**

Potential interactions exist between certain components and other medications.  For example, zinc can interfere with the absorption of certain antibiotics.  Consult with a doctor or pharmacist regarding potential interactions with prescribed medications, OTC drugs, and supplements.  Food and lifestyle factors like alcohol or certain dietary restrictions may also interact with the components.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

This combination may be beneficial during pregnancy and breastfeeding to support maternal and fetal/infant health.  However, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriateness and safety of use during these periods.  The FDA Pregnancy Safety Category is not established for this specific combination.
