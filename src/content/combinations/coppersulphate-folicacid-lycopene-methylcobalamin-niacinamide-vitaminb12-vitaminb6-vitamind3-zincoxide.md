## **Usage**

This combination of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants is primarily used to treat or prevent nutritional deficiencies.  It's often prescribed for conditions like:

* **Vitamin B12 deficiency:** Methylcobalamin and Vitamin B12 address this deficiency, which can cause anemia and neurological problems.
* **Folate deficiency:** Folic acid helps prevent neural tube defects in developing fetuses and treats folate-deficiency anemia.
* **General nutritional deficiency:** This combination helps ensure adequate intake of essential vitamins and minerals, supporting overall health.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This combination falls under the category of multivitamin and multimineral supplements, along with antioxidants.  It doesn't fit neatly into a single pharmacological class like antibiotics or analgesics.

**Mechanism of Action:** Each component has a distinct mechanism:

* **B Vitamins (Methylcobalamin, B12, B6, Niacinamide):** Act as coenzymes in various metabolic processes, including energy production, DNA synthesis, and nerve function.
* **Vitamin D3:** Regulates calcium and phosphorus absorption, contributing to bone health.
* **Folic Acid:** Essential for DNA synthesis and cell division.
* **Zinc Oxide:** Supports immune function and wound healing.
* **Copper Sulphate:**  Aids in iron absorption and various enzymatic reactions.
* **Lycopene:** An antioxidant that may protect against cell damage.


## **Alternate Names**

This combination is not typically known by a specific single name.  It's generally referred to by its component ingredients. Brand names may vary.  One example is "Vitbuz."
