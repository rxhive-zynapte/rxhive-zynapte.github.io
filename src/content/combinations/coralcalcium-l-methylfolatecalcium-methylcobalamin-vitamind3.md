## **Usage**

This combination medication is used to address nutritional deficiencies related to calcium, vitamin D3, methylcobalamin (vitamin B12), and L-methylfolate (vitamin B9).  It is prescribed for conditions like:

* Osteoporosis
* Osteomalacia
* Rickets
* Hypocalcemia
* Megaloblastic anemia (due to B12 or folate deficiency)
* Conditions with impaired nutrient absorption

It is also beneficial for pregnant or breastfeeding women, the elderly, those with lactose intolerance, and individuals following vegan diets.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product. Individual components classify as:

* Calcium carbonate/Coral Calcium: Mineral supplement
* Vitamin D3: Fat-soluble vitamin supplement
* Methylcobalamin: Water-soluble vitamin (B12) supplement
* L-Methylfolate: Water-soluble vitamin (B9) supplement

**Mechanism of Action:**

* **Calcium:** Essential for bone health, nerve function, muscle contraction, and blood clotting.
* **Vitamin D3:** Improves calcium absorption from the gut and regulates calcium/phosphorus metabolism.
* **Methylcobalamin:** Crucial for nerve cell maintenance, red blood cell formation, and DNA synthesis.
* **L-Methylfolate:** Essential for cell growth/division, especially during pregnancy for neural tube development. It's the active form of folate, readily used by the body.

## **Alternate Names**

Ekocal; Cal 123 Total; Vehycal Xt; Tricium Active; Tayo Total; Koral Max; Coralife Max; Kapcal; Ostovista Plus; Ostovista Forte.  No internationally recognized non-proprietary name exists for this specific combination.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Calcium:**  Supports bone mineralization, neuromuscular transmission, and enzyme activity.
* **Vitamin D3:**  Increases calcium absorption and bone mineralization. It also modulates immune function.
* **Methylcobalamin:**  Coenzyme for various metabolic processes, including DNA synthesis and myelin formation.
* **L-Methylfolate:** Involved in DNA/RNA synthesis and amino acid metabolism.  Crucial for fetal development.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Calcium:** Absorbed in the small intestine, influenced by vitamin D. Excreted renally and in feces.
* **Vitamin D3:** Absorbed in the gut, hydroxylated in the liver and kidney to its active form (calcitriol).
* **Methylcobalamin:** Absorbed via intrinsic factor in the ileum. Stored in the liver.
* **L-Methylfolate:** Absorbed in the small intestine. Metabolized in the liver.


**Mode of Action:** Not applicable to the combination as a whole, but each component has a distinct mode of action as described above.


**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, neurotransmitter modulation:**

* Vitamin D3 binds to vitamin D receptors, influencing gene transcription.
* Methylcobalamin acts as a coenzyme for methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase.
* L-methylfolate is involved in enzymatic reactions for nucleotide synthesis.


**Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal and fecal for all components, following metabolism in the liver where applicable.


## **Dosage**

Dosage varies depending on individual patient needs and the specific formulation. It is crucial to consult with a physician for personalized dosing recommendations. Below is a general guideline based on over-the-counter formulations and examples, not prescription medications:


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Special Cases:**  Dosages should be adjusted by a physician considering the patient's condition and comorbidities.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is not typically used in acute clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Specific medications are used in those cases based on established protocols.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosages may need adjustments in patients with renal/hepatic impairment or other conditions impacting drug metabolism. This should be determined by a healthcare professional.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Constipation
* Nausea
* Upset stomach

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypercalcemia (high calcium levels)


## **Contraindications**

* Hypercalcemia
* Vitamin D toxicity
* Hypersensitivity to any of the components

## **Drug Interactions**

* Antacids can reduce calcium absorption.
* Certain medications (e.g., bisphosphonates, levothyroxine) may interact with calcium.
* Some antibiotics may interact with vitamin D absorption.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Generally considered safe when taken as directed, though excessive intake should be avoided. Consult a healthcare professional for appropriate dosing during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
