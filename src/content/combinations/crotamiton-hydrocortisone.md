## **Usage**

Crotamiton + Hydrocortisone is prescribed for the relief of inflammation and itching associated with various skin conditions, including:

*   Allergic or irritant contact dermatitis
*   Mild to moderate eczema
*   Insect bite reactions
*   Scabies

**Pharmacological Classification:**

*   Crotamiton: Antiparasitic, scabicide, antipruritic
*   Hydrocortisone: Corticosteroid, anti-inflammatory, antipruritic

**Mechanism of Action:**

Crotamiton disrupts the nervous system of scabies mites, leading to their paralysis and death. It also has a mild local anesthetic effect. Hydrocortisone binds to glucocorticoid receptors in skin cells, reducing the production of inflammatory mediators.  The combination provides dual action against scabies and the associated inflammation and itching.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Crotamiton + Hydrocortisone" is the generic name, several brand names exist, such as Eurax HC and Crotorax HC.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

Crotamiton kills scabies mites and their eggs, and also relieves itching. Hydrocortisone suppresses the inflammatory response, reducing redness, swelling, and itching.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   Absorption: Minimal systemic absorption with topical application.
*   Metabolism: Hydrocortisone is metabolized primarily in the liver.
*   Elimination:  Hydrocortisone metabolites are primarily excreted renally.

**Mode of Action:**

Crotamiton targets the nervous system of mites. Hydrocortisone binds to glucocorticoid receptors, affecting gene transcription and reducing inflammatory mediator production.

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**

Hydrocortisone exerts its effect through binding to glucocorticoid receptors. Crotamiton's mechanism isn't fully elucidated but involves disruption of mite neuronal function.

**Elimination pathways:**

Hydrocortisone is metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Crotamiton, when absorbed systemically, is also primarily metabolized hepatically and renally cleared.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a thin layer to the affected area(s) 1-2 times daily. Do not use for more than 7-14 days continuously.


#### **Children:**

*   Under 3 years: Use only under strict medical supervision, typically once daily.
*   3 years and older: Similar to adult dosage, 1-2 times daily.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to the risk of skin thinning and other corticosteroid-related side effects.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No specific dose adjustment is usually needed for topical application. Monitor for systemic effects with prolonged use over large areas.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution, as hydrocortisone is metabolized in the liver.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with diabetes, hypertension, or other conditions potentially aggravated by corticosteroids.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Crotamiton + Hydrocortisone is generally not indicated for use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are based on the patient's response and the severity of the skin condition. Start with the lowest effective dose.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Itching
*   Rash
*   Erythema (skin redness)
*   Skin irritation
*   Burning or stinging sensation

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Allergic reactions (hives, angioedema, difficulty breathing)
*   Worsening of skin condition
*   Skin atrophy (thinning) with prolonged use

### **Long-Term Effects:**

*   Skin thinning, striae (stretch marks), telangiectasia (spider veins) with prolonged high-potency corticosteroid use


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

*   Severe allergic reactions
*   Cushing's syndrome (with prolonged use of high-potency corticosteroids over large body surface areas)



## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to crotamiton or hydrocortisone.
*   Bacterial, viral, or fungal skin infections.
*   Open wounds or broken skin.
*   Acute exudative dermatoses.

## **Drug Interactions**

Limited information is available on drug interactions with topical Crotamiton + Hydrocortisone. It is prudent to inform patients about potential additive effects with other topical corticosteroids or antipruritics. Other topical medications applied to the same area should be used cautiously.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy:  Not recommended, especially during the first trimester. Consult a physician if the benefits outweigh the risks.

Breastfeeding:  Limited data available. Consult a physician before use.
