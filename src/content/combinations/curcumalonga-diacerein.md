## **Usage**

Curcuma Longa + Diacerein is prescribed for the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis, particularly in the hip and knee.  It aims to reduce pain, inflammation, and stiffness, thereby improving joint function and mobility.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Diacerein is classified as a slow-acting, disease-modifying osteoarthritis drug and interleukin-1 beta inhibitor, belonging to the anthraquinone derivative class. Curcuma Longa (turmeric) is considered a herbal supplement with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Diacerein's primary mechanism involves inhibiting interleukin-1 (IL-1), a crucial cytokine in inflammation and cartilage degradation within osteoarthritis.  Curcuma Longa, primarily through curcuminoids, exerts anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects by modulating several signaling pathways.

## **Alternate Names**

**Diacerein:** Diacetylrhein; 2-Anthracenecarboxylic acid, 4,5-bis(acetyloxy)-9,10-dihydro-9,10-dioxo-.

**Curcuma Longa:** Turmeric,  Haldi, Indian Saffron, Haridra.

**Brand Names:**  Lukin Nxt.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Diacerein, metabolized to rhein, selectively inhibits IL-1, mitigating inflammation and cartilage breakdown. Curcuminoids in Curcuma Longa modulate signaling pathways, contributing to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Diacerein is almost entirely converted to rhein before entering systemic circulation, subsequently metabolized to rhein glucuronide and rhein sulfate. Approximately 37% is excreted in urine and 53% in feces, with a 4-10 hour elimination half-life. Curcumin, with poor bioavailability, undergoes rapid metabolism.


**Mode of Action:** Rhein, the active metabolite of diacerein, acts by inhibiting IL-1β activity. It is unclear whether this activity is related to receptor antagonism or affects IL-1β production or activation. Curcumin modulates multiple targets, including inflammatory mediators (NF-κB, COX-2, 5-LOX, TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8), and exerts its antioxidant effects by scavenging ROS and increasing endogenous antioxidant levels.



**Elimination pathways:** For Diacerein, approximately 37% is excreted in urine and 53% in feces. For Curcuma Longa (curcumin), it is primarily excreted through feces following hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard Diacerein dose is 50 mg twice daily, orally, with or after meals.  An initial dose of 50 mg once daily with the evening meal for 2-4 weeks may be titrated to 100 mg daily (divided doses) based on tolerance.  Concomitant Curcuma Longa is typically 50 mg twice daily, varying with the specific product.

#### **Children:**  Curcuma Longa + Diacerein is generally not recommended for children under 18.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients (over 65):**  Not recommended due to increased severe diarrhea risk. If necessary, start with a reduced dose (50 mg once daily) under close monitoring.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Contraindicated in severe renal impairment. Reduce the dose to 25 mg twice daily for moderate impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in any degree of hepatic dysfunction.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised for patients with gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease). Consider dose adjustments or alternative therapies.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Curcuma Longa + Diacerein is not indicated for Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, or Emergency Situations.  Its primary use is in managing chronic osteoarthritis.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjust dosages for renal/hepatic impairment. Closely monitor patients with a history of gastrointestinal issues.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Diarrhea (most common)
- Discolored urine (yellow-brown)
- Abdominal pain
- Flatulence
- Nausea
- Vomiting

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Hepatotoxicity (liver damage) – requires immediate discontinuation.
- Severe diarrhea, especially in the elderly – requires immediate discontinuation.
- Allergic skin reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic complications from prolonged Diacerein use may affect the gastrointestinal tract and liver. Monitor liver function tests regularly.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Clinically significant ADRs include hepatotoxicity and severe diarrhea, requiring immediate intervention and treatment cessation.
