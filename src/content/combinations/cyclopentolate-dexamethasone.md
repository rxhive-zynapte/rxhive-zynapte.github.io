## **Usage**

Cyclopentolate + Dexamethasone is prescribed for inflammatory eye conditions, pre- and post-operative inflammation, and facilitating ophthalmic examinations.  It combines a mydriatic (Cyclopentolate) and an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid (Dexamethasone).  The pharmacological classifications are:

* **Cyclopentolate:** Anticholinergic, Mydriatic, Cycloplegic
* **Dexamethasone:** Corticosteroid, Anti-inflammatory, Immunosuppressant


Cyclopentolate works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, which dilates the pupil (mydriasis) and paralyzes the eye's focusing muscle (cycloplegia).  Dexamethasone reduces inflammation by suppressing the immune response and inhibiting inflammatory mediators.

## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for the combination product itself. The individual components are sometimes referred to as:

* **Cyclopentolate:** Cyclogyl, AK-Pentolate, Cylate, Ocu-Pentolate
* **Dexamethasone:** Various brand names exist depending on the formulation and manufacturer.


Common brand names for the combination include:

*   Cyclogyl-D
*   Dexacidin
*   Cytocor

This is not an exhaustive list, and availability may vary regionally.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Cyclopentolate:** Blocks muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the eye, causing pupillary dilation and ciliary muscle paralysis.

* **Dexamethasone:** Binds to glucocorticoid receptors, inhibiting inflammatory pathways, suppressing immune cell activity, and reducing vascular permeability.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Cyclopentolate:**  Topical administration leads to rapid absorption into the ocular tissues. Systemic absorption can occur, especially in children. Metabolism and elimination pathways are not fully characterized.

* **Dexamethasone:** Topical administration results in local effects with some systemic absorption. Dexamethasone is metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted by the kidneys.


**Mode of Action:**

* **Cyclopentolate:** Antagonizes the effects of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors in the iris sphincter and ciliary muscles.

* **Dexamethasone:** Inhibits phospholipase A2, reducing the production of arachidonic acid and subsequent inflammatory mediators (prostaglandins, leukotrienes). It also suppresses the migration and function of inflammatory cells, and decreases vascular permeability.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 

* For inflammation: 1-2 drops in the affected eye(s) every 4-6 hours.
* For mydriasis/cycloplegia: 1-2 drops of 1% solution, repeated in 5 minutes if needed.

#### **Children:**

* Dosage should be individualized based on age and the condition being treated.  Lower concentrations (0.5% or 1%) are generally preferred.
* For mydriasis/cycloplegia in infants: A single drop of 0.5% may be sufficient.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lowest effective dose and monitor for systemic side effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised, as some systemic absorption occurs. Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustment may be needed in moderate to severe impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with glaucoma, heart conditions, hypertension, Down syndrome, or seizure disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Uveitis:** Frequent dosing (every hour initially, then tapering) may be necessary.
* **Post-operative inflammation:** 1-2 drops 4-6 times daily, tapering as inflammation subsides.
* **Other inflammatory conditions:** Dosage varies depending on the severity.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Renal and hepatic impairment may necessitate dosage reductions. Consult current guidelines for specific recommendations.  


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
* Ocular: Burning, stinging, blurred vision, increased sensitivity to light, eye redness, foreign body sensation.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Elevated intraocular pressure, especially in patients with glaucoma.
* Systemic:  Tachycardia, hypertension, behavioral changes, adrenal suppression (with prolonged use).

### **Long-Term Effects**

* Cataracts, glaucoma, secondary infections (with prolonged use).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

* Allergic reactions (rare): Itching, swelling, difficulty breathing.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to Cyclopentolate or Dexamethasone.
* Untreated narrow-angle glaucoma.
* Acute herpes simplex keratitis.
* Fungal infections of the cornea.


## **Drug Interactions**

* Other anticholinergics: Additive effects.
* Systemic corticosteroids: Increased risk of systemic side effects.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Use only if clearly needed.  Safety Category C (US FDA).

* **Breastfeeding:** Exercise caution.  The amount of drug excreted in breast milk is unknown.  


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Cyclopentolate: Anticholinergic; Dexamethasone: Corticosteroid.

* **Side Effects:** Burning, stinging, blurred vision, photosensitivity, increased intraocular pressure, systemic anticholinergic/corticosteroid effects.

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, narrow-angle glaucoma, herpes simplex keratitis, fungal infections of the cornea.

* **Drug Interactions:** Other anticholinergics, corticosteroids.

* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution in pregnancy (Category C); caution advised during breastfeeding.

* **Dosage:** Varies depending on indication and patient age.


## **Popular Combinations**

This is a commonly prescribed combination, and no further combinations involving both drugs are routinely recommended.

## **Precautions**

* Monitor intraocular pressure, especially in patients at risk for glaucoma.

* Prolonged use can increase the risk of cataracts, glaucoma, and secondary infections.
* Children and elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of cyclopentolate.
