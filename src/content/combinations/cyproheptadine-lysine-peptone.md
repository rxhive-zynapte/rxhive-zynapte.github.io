## **Usage**

Cyproheptadine + Lysine + Peptone is prescribed as an appetite stimulant and for managing various conditions related to poor nutrition and weight loss. It is indicated for:

* Lack of appetite and unintentional weight loss
* Anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders
* Malnutrition or failure to thrive in children
* Weight loss due to chronic illnesses (e.g., cancer, HIV/AIDS)
* Countering appetite suppression from certain medications

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Cyproheptadine: Antihistamine, antiserotonergic
* Lysine: Essential amino acid, nutritional supplement
* Peptone: Nutritional supplement

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination therapy works synergistically to stimulate appetite and promote weight gain. Cyproheptadine primarily antagonizes serotonin (5-HT2) receptors in the hypothalamus, the appetite-regulating center of the brain.  It also has antihistaminic (H1 receptor blocking) properties. Lysine, an essential amino acid, aids in protein synthesis and growth, supporting overall nutritional status. Peptone provides readily digestible peptides and amino acids, contributing to improved nutrition.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication is marketed under various brand names, including:

* Cyprowal Syrup
* Cyptone L Syrup/Drops
* Cydine Syrup
* Nyaibi Syrup
* Hepto Pep Syrup
* Peptone Gold Syrup
* Aptaup Syrup
* Oraxin (Oractine)

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cyproheptadine's primary action is serotonin (5-HT2) receptor antagonism in the hypothalamus, leading to increased appetite. It also exhibits antihistaminic effects by blocking H1 receptors. Lysine contributes to protein synthesis and growth, promoting overall nutritional status.  Peptone's components are absorbed and utilized in protein synthesis. 

**Pharmacokinetics:** Cyproheptadine is metabolized primarily in the liver via CYP450 enzymes and excreted in urine and feces. Lysine is also metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine. Information on the pharmacokinetics of peptone in this combination requires further study.


## **Dosage**

Dosage needs to be personalized based on individual patient factors, including age, weight, medical condition, and concurrent medications. Always consult a physician for appropriate dosage determination.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

A typical adult dosage for syrup formulations is 10ml three times daily before meals. Tablet formulations of cyproheptadine alone range from 4mg to 20mg daily, divided into multiple doses.

#### **Children:**

Dosage needs to be individualized based on the child's age, weight, and medical condition. Liquid formulations are generally preferred.  For example:

* 2-6 years: 5ml syrup, two to three times daily before meals.
* 7-14 years: 10ml syrup, two to three times daily before meals.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Initiate with a lower dose and titrate cautiously based on tolerance and clinical response due to potential age-related decline in hepatic and renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage reduction may be necessary based on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use cautiously and monitor closely due to the liver's role in cyproheptadine metabolism. Dosage adjustment is warranted.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful evaluation and dosage modification may be needed in patients with conditions like asthma, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, or urinary retention.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The primary clinical use of this combination is for stimulating appetite and promoting weight gain. Specific dosage recommendations for specialized clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations are not established.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are made based on individual patient characteristics, including renal/hepatic function, other medical conditions, and concurrent medication use. Close monitoring of therapeutic response and potential side effects is advised.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Dry mouth
* Nausea
* Headache
* Blurred vision
* Constipation

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Confusion
* Hallucinations
* Ataxia (impaired balance/coordination)
* Seizures
* Irregular heartbeat

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term effects are not well documented but may include dependence or tolerance to cyproheptadine's appetite-stimulating properties.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Clinically significant ADRs requiring immediate medical attention include severe allergic reactions, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication
* Glaucoma
* Urinary retention

* Antidepressants (e.g., duloxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline, MAOIs)
* Anti-anxiety medications (e.g., diazepam, lorazepam)
* Sleeping pills (e.g., zolpidem, temazepam)
* Muscle relaxants (e.g., baclofen, tizanidine)
* Opioid pain relievers (e.g., morphine, fentanyl)
* Antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole)
* Antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, ciprofloxacin)
* Alcohol

It is crucial to inform your physician about all medications, including OTC drugs and supplements, before starting this combination therapy.
