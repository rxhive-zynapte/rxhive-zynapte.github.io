## **Usage**

Cyproterone + Ethinyl Estradiol + Folic Acid is a hormonal medication primarily prescribed for the treatment of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in women.  It addresses symptoms such as acne, hirsutism (excessive hair growth), and irregular menstrual cycles. This combination is also effective in treating severe acne and hirsutism unrelated to PCOS.  It acts as an oral contraceptive but should not be prescribed for contraception alone.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Hormonal contraceptive, anti-androgen.

**Mechanism of Action:** Cyproterone acetate is an anti-androgen that blocks the effects of male hormones (androgens). Ethinyl estradiol is a synthetic estrogen that regulates the menstrual cycle and enhances the effect of cyproterone. Folic acid is included to address potential folate deficiency induced by the hormonal components.


## **Alternate Names**

No commonly used alternate names for this specific combination exist. Brand names may vary regionally. 

**Brand Names:**  Examples of Brand Names: Diane-35, Estelle-35, Harmoni-F (Brand names vary depending on the region, please consult local pharmaceutical resources for details).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cyproterone acetate competes with androgens for receptor binding, reducing androgenic effects like sebum production and hair growth. Ethinyl estradiol suppresses the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), leading to decreased luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion. This, in turn, suppresses ovulation. Ethinyl estradiol also potentiates cyproterone's anti-androgenic action. Folic acid is essential for cell growth and division.


**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:**  Ethinyl estradiol and cyproterone acetate are readily absorbed after oral administration. Food may slightly delay absorption.
* **Metabolism:** Both ethinyl estradiol and cyproterone acetate are extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP enzymes, including CYP3A4.
* **Elimination:** Metabolites are excreted in urine and feces.

**Receptor Binding:** Cyproterone acetate binds to androgen receptors.

**Enzyme Inhibition:** Ethinyl estradiol can inhibit certain CYP enzymes involved in drug metabolism.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism followed by renal and biliary excretion of metabolites.
