      methods if pills are missed or during concomitant use of enzyme-inducing
      medications.  Discuss the risks and benefits of the medication thoroughly,
      including the increased risk of thromboembolism.

## **Usage**

Cyproterone + Ethinyl Estradiol is prescribed for women of reproductive age to treat moderate to severe acne (with or without seborrhea), hirsutism (excessive hair growth), and androgenetic alopecia (female pattern hair loss) related to androgen sensitivity. It is also used as an oral contraceptive in women being treated for these androgen-dependent conditions.  It may also be used in managing symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Anti-androgen
* Estrogen
* Combined oral contraceptive

**Mechanism of Action:**

Cyproterone acetate is an anti-androgen that competes with androgens for binding to androgen receptors, thus reducing androgenic effects. Ethinyl estradiol, a synthetic estrogen, enhances cyproterone's effect by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, further reducing free androgen activity. The combination also provides contraception by inhibiting ovulation and altering cervical mucus, creating an environment unfavorable for fertilization and implantation.

## **Alternate Names**

* Co-cyprindiol
* Ethinylestradiol/cyproterone acetate (EE/CPA)

**Brand Names:**

* Diane-35
* Estelle-35
 * Dianette



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cyproterone competes with androgens at receptor sites, decreasing their effects on target tissues like skin, hair follicles, and sebaceous glands. Ethinyl estradiol suppresses gonadotropin release, leading to reduced ovarian androgen production. The estrogen component also increases SHBG, further lowering free androgen levels.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Both drugs are absorbed orally. Cyproterone is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4.  Ethinyl estradiol undergoes hepatic metabolism, with some enterohepatic recirculation. Both drugs are primarily eliminated through the kidneys and in feces.


**Mode of Action:** Cyproterone acts as a competitive antagonist at androgen receptors. Ethinyl estradiol modulates gene transcription through estrogen receptor binding, affecting SHBG synthesis.

**Receptor binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Cyproterone binds to androgen receptors. Ethinyl estradiol indirectly influences androgen activity by increasing SHBG levels.

**Elimination Pathways:** Both drugs are primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism and subsequent renal and biliary excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** One tablet daily, containing 2 mg cyproterone acetate and 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol, for 21 consecutive days, followed by a 7-day pill-free interval.

#### **Children:**  Use only after menarche, at the same adult dose.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Not indicated after menopause.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Use with caution. Dosage adjustments may be needed depending on the degree of impairment.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment. Use with caution in mild to moderate impairment.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution in patients with cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, smoking), history of thromboembolism, migraine with aura, or liver disease.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Cyproterone + Ethinyl Estradiol is not indicated for use in the clinical settings of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary use is for the management of androgen-dependent dermatological conditions.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea, vomiting
* Headache
* Breast tenderness
* Weight changes
* Mood swings
* Breakthrough bleeding/spotting

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke)
* Liver dysfunction
* Jaundice
* Allergic reactions


### **Long-Term Effects:**

* Increased risk of cardiovascular events in certain patient populations (e.g., smokers over 35 years of age)

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)

* Migraine with aura
* Smokers over 35 years old
* Hypersensitivity to cyproterone acetate or ethinyl estradiol

## **Drug Interactions**

* Enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, griseofulvin, St. Johnâ€™s Wort) may decrease efficacy and increase the risk of breakthrough bleeding.
* Some antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin, tetracyclines) can alter the enterohepatic circulation of the drug, affecting its effectiveness. 
* Concomitant use with medications metabolized by CYP3A4 may result in altered metabolism of either agent.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy Safety Category:** X (Contraindicated). It may cause fetal harm.

**Breastfeeding:** This medication is contraindicated while breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Anti-androgen and estrogenic effects, ovulation inhibition.
