## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). It addresses several PCOS features, including insulin resistance, hyperandrogenism, and menstrual irregularities.  It is classified as a nutritional supplement and insulin sensitizer.

The components work synergistically: Myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol improve insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake; Metformin lowers blood glucose; L-methylfolate (the active form of folate) reduces homocysteine levels; and Methylcobalamin (vitamin B12) supports nerve function and homocysteine metabolism.

## **Alternate Names**

While there isn't a universally recognized alternate name, this combination may be referred to as a "PCOS management supplement."  Some brand names marketing similar combinations include Met-PCO Care and Mysofert-M.  Myofolin-D is another brand name which contains this combination. Regional or international variations exist with slight differences in formulations.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol are insulin-sensitizing agents, improving cellular glucose uptake and utilization. Metformin enhances insulin action, reduces hepatic glucose production, and improves peripheral glucose uptake. L-methylfolate participates in one-carbon metabolism, lowering homocysteine levels. Methylcobalamin is involved in various metabolic pathways, including homocysteine metabolism and myelin synthesis.


**Pharmacokinetics:** Myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol are absorbed in the gut, with peak plasma concentrations reached within hours. Metformin absorption is incomplete and occurs in the small intestine. L-methylfolate is actively transported across the gut, and its bioavailability is high. Methylcobalamin is absorbed via intrinsic factor-mediated transport.  Metformin undergoes negligible metabolism and is renally cleared. Inositol isomers, folate, and methylcobalamin undergo hepatic metabolism, followed by renal excretion.

**Mode of Action:** Myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol influence insulin signaling pathways.  Metformin activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), affecting glucose and lipid metabolism. L-methylfolate is a cofactor for enzymes involved in nucleotide synthesis and homocysteine remethylation. Methylcobalamin acts as a coenzyme in various metabolic reactions.

**Elimination Pathways:** Metformin is eliminated primarily by the kidneys. Myo-inositol, D-chiro-inositol, L-methylfolate, and Methylcobalamin are metabolized in the liver and subsequently excreted by the kidneys.



## **Dosage**

Dosage is determined by a physician based on individual patient needs.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** A common dosage (as per available sources) is Myo-inositol 550mg + D-chiro-inositol 13.8mg + Metformin 500mg + L-methylfolate calcium 0.5mg + Methylcobalamin 750mcg. This is often administered once or twice daily, usually with food.

#### **Children:** This combination is generally not recommended for children due to limited safety and efficacy data.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and titrate based on renal function and tolerability.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment, particularly for metformin, is crucial. Contraindicated in severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use cautiously; dose adjustment might be required. Metformin is contraindicated in severe hepatic dysfunction.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or other conditions is essential.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is not typically used for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments should be made for renal/hepatic impairment, metabolic disorders, drug interactions, and patient response.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, loss of appetite, changes in taste, headache, tiredness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Lactic acidosis (metformin), megaloblastic anemia (methylcobalamin or L-methylfolate deficiency).

### **Long-Term Effects:**
Long-term effects are not comprehensively documented, but vitamin B12 deficiency or folate deficiency could develop with inadequate intake or absorption issues.  Long-term metformin use may affect vitamin B12 absorption.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
Severe gastrointestinal effects, lactic acidosis, allergic reactions.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any component, severe kidney/liver impairment, metabolic acidosis, vitamin B12 deficiency, uncontrolled heart failure, acute myocardial infarction.

## **Drug Interactions**

Sulfonylureas, insulin, diuretics, beta-2 agonists, corticosteroids, antihypertensives, cationic drugs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, thyroid medications, alcohol.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult a doctor before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  While L-methylfolate and Methylcobalamin are generally safe during pregnancy, metformin use requires careful risk-benefit assessment.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Improves insulin sensitivity, regulates ovarian function, reduces homocysteine.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, rarely lactic acidosis.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe kidney/liver disease, metabolic acidosis.
- **Drug Interactions:** Several; consult a physician.

## **Popular Combinations**

This combination often includes additional supplements like vitamin D or omega-3 fatty acids.


## **Precautions**

Monitor renal/liver function, blood glucose, and vitamin B12 levels.  Assess for pre-existing medical conditions, allergies, or concomitant medications.  Caution advised with alcohol use.
