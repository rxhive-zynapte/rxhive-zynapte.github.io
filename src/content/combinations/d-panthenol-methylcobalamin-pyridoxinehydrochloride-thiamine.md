## **Usage**

This combination of B vitamins is prescribed for the treatment and prevention of vitamin B deficiencies, particularly B1, B5, B6, and B12. These deficiencies can arise from various factors such as poor diet, certain illnesses, alcoholism, or pregnancy. This combination is also used to support nerve function, promote cell growth, aid red blood cell production, and contribute to overall nutritional status, including wound healing and maintaining healthy skin and hair. Specific conditions this combination might be used for include beriberi (thiamine deficiency), peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage), megaloblastic anemia (vitamin B12 deficiency anemia), and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (a brain disorder caused by thiamine deficiency).

**Pharmacological Classification:** Vitamin Supplement; Nutritional Agent.

**Mechanism of Action:** Each vitamin plays a specific role:
- Thiamine (B1): Acts as a coenzyme in carbohydrate metabolism, essential for energy production, nerve function, and muscle contraction.
- Pyridoxine (B6): Involved in protein and amino acid metabolism, red blood cell formation, and neurotransmitter synthesis.
- Methylcobalamin (B12): Essential for nerve function, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell formation.
- D-Panthenol (B5): Provitamin of pantothenic acid, a component of coenzyme A, vital for cellular metabolism, including fatty acid synthesis and degradation, and acetylcholine and steroid hormone synthesis.

## **Alternate Names**

Vitamin B Complex; B-Complex Injection

## **Brand Names**

Numerous brand names exist for combinations containing these ingredients. Some examples observed are:
- Nurokind Plus Injection (Mankind Pharma)
- Nurotech Injection (Mednox Health Care)
- Safemin-Plus Injection (Reward Pharmaceuticals)
-  Trib-DSR (Torrent Pharma)
-  Neurobion Forte Injection (Merck)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The combination replenishes depleted B vitamin levels. Each component contributes to specific physiological processes.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

- **Absorption:** Thiamine is absorbed from the GI tract. Methylcobalamin absorption relies on intrinsic factor in the stomach. Pyridoxine is absorbed from the small intestine. D-Panthenol is absorbed readily through the skin and gut.
- **Metabolism:** Thiamine is not stored but excreted as unchanged or metabolites in urine. Methylcobalamin is stored in the liver, undergoes enterohepatic recycling, and excreted in bile and urine. Pyridoxine is converted to its active form, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. D-Panthenol is converted to pantothenic acid.
- **Elimination:** Thiamine is excreted in the urine. Methylcobalamin is excreted in bile and urine. Pyridoxine metabolites are excreted in the urine. D-Panthenol is primarily eliminated renally.

**Mode of Action (Cellular/Molecular Level):** Thiamine's active form, thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), is a coenzyme in decarboxylation reactions. Methylcobalamin is a coenzyme in methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase reactions. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate is a coenzyme for various enzymes, including transaminases and decarboxylases. Panthenic acid is a part of coenzyme A, participating in various metabolic pathways.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** No direct receptor binding. They primarily function as coenzymes for vital enzymes involved in metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis.


## **Dosage**

Dosage depends on the specific product and patient needs. Healthcare provider instructions should always be followed.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Dosage varies based on the specific product and deficiency being addressed.

#### **Children:**

Pediatric dosing should be individualized based on age, weight, and clinical condition. Consult pediatric dosing guidelines.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Monitor for potential adverse effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Thiamine dose reduction may be necessary. Monitor renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Careful monitoring is recommended due to the potential for altered metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Assess for drug interactions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:** May be given as part of a nutritional support regimen.
- **Emergency Situations (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest):** High-dose thiamine may be administered.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Modifications may be based on clinical response, lab findings, renal function, and other patient-specific factors.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Generally well-tolerated. Some possible mild effects: mild gastrointestinal upset, injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling), itching, rash.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing, wheezing, tightness in the chest, swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue), sensory neuropathy (numbness, tingling, pain) especially with excessive pyridoxine.


### **Long-Term Effects**

Generally safe for long-term use when taken as directed. High doses of B6 over prolonged periods can lead to peripheral neuropathy.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Levodopa: Pyridoxine may decrease its effectiveness.
- Isoniazid, cycloserine, penicillamine: May interfere with pyridoxine.
- Alcohol and certain antibiotics: Can affect thiamine absorption or utilization.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding at recommended doses. Consult a healthcare professional.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

Refer to sections above.

## **Popular Combinations**

Often combined with other B vitamins (niacinamide, riboflavin, etc.) for comprehensive B-complex supplementation.

## **Precautions**

Pre-screening for allergies or sensitivities. Caution advised for patients with renal impairment. Monitor for potential interactions with other medications and pre-existing conditions.
