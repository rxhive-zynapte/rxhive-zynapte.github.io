## **Usage**

This combination of vitamins is prescribed for preventing and treating vitamin deficiencies in patients receiving parenteral nutrition (when nutrition is delivered intravenously).  These deficiencies can arise from various factors, including inadequate dietary intake, malabsorption, alcoholism, and certain medical conditions.  It is also used preventatively in patients who are unable to obtain sufficient vitamins through diet. The pharmacological classification of this drug is vitamin supplement/nutritional supplement.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no one single official name for this specific combination of vitamins.  The components are often referred to as part of a "B-complex" or "multivitamin" formulation. It is generally identified by its component vitamins. Brand names vary depending upon the manufacturer. One example from the source material included Infuvite Pediatric.

## **How It Works**

This combination drug works by replenishing deficient vitamins. Each vitamin plays a specific role in the body:

* **D-Panthenol (Provitamin B5):** Converted to pantothenic acid, a component of coenzyme A, essential for energy metabolism, fatty acid synthesis, and steroid hormone production.
* **Niacinamide (Vitamin B3):** Precursor to NAD and NADP, coenzymes involved in various metabolic reactions, including energy production, DNA repair, and cell signaling.
* **Thiamine (Vitamin B1):** Essential for carbohydrate metabolism, nerve function, and muscle function. It acts as a coenzyme in several key metabolic pathways.
* **Vitamin A:** Important for vision, immune function, cell growth and differentiation.
* **Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin):**  Precursor to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), coenzymes necessary for cellular respiration, energy production, and metabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins.
* **Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine):** Acts as a coenzyme in many metabolic reactions, including amino acid metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and red blood cell formation.
* **Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid):** Antioxidant, important for collagen synthesis, immune function, wound healing, and iron absorption.
* **Vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol):** Regulates calcium and phosphorus homeostasis, essential for bone health, immune function and cell growth.
* **Vitamin E (Tocopherol):** Antioxidant that protects cell membranes from damage.

These vitamins are generally well absorbed following intravenous administration, metabolized in the liver, and excreted through the kidneys or in bile.
