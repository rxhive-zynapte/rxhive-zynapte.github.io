## **Usage**

This combination of vitamins is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of vitamin deficiencies.  It is particularly useful in situations where oral intake is compromised or insufficient, such as during periods of malnutrition, malabsorption, or when patients are receiving parenteral nutrition.  This combination is not classified under a single pharmacological class but is considered a multivitamin supplement. The mechanism of action involves replenishing essential vitamins required for various physiological functions.


## **Alternate Names** 

There is no single official alternate name for this specific multivitamin combination.  Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and the specific formulation.  One example found in the sources is "Introvit Oral". It is more common to refer to this combination by its individual components.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Each vitamin in this combination exerts specific effects on the body.  Vitamin A supports epithelial tissue and vision. Vitamin D3 regulates calcium and phosphate metabolism. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant. B vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, nicotinamide) are crucial for energy production and nerve function. Vitamin C is an antioxidant and supports immune function. D-Panthenol is a provitamin of B5 and contributes to various metabolic processes.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The individual vitamins in this formulation are absorbed, metabolized, and eliminated through different pathways.  Water-soluble vitamins (B vitamins and vitamin C) are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and readily excreted in urine.  Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E) are absorbed along with dietary fats and stored in the liver and adipose tissue. Elimination of fat-soluble vitamins is slower.

**Mode of Action:**  Vitamins function as coenzymes or precursors for coenzymes in numerous metabolic reactions.  For instance, B vitamins are essential for the function of various enzymes involved in energy production. Vitamin K is necessary for blood clotting. The exact mechanism of action of the combination is a result of the individual mechanisms of its components.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**  
#### **Adults:**  
Dosages vary depending on the specific product formulation. One example from the sources suggests 1 ml per 40 kg body weight for 3-5 days, but this is likely for veterinary use. Refer to the specific product's prescribing information for the recommended adult dosage.
