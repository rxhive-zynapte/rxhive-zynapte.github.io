      How does rebound congestion occur?**


      **A:** Prolonged use (more than 3-5 days) can lead to rebound congestion,
      where the nasal passages become more congested after the medication wears
      off, creating a dependence on the spray.

## **Usage**

D-Panthenol + Oxymetazoline is prescribed for the temporary relief of nasal congestion associated with the common cold, sinusitis, hay fever, and other upper respiratory allergies. Dexpanthenol, a derivative of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), is added to soothe and moisturize irritated nasal mucosa.

* **Pharmacological Classification:** Decongestant (Oxymetazoline), moisturizer/epithelial protectant (D-Panthenol)
* **Mechanism of Action:** Oxymetazoline, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, constricts blood vessels in the nasal mucosa, reducing swelling and congestion. Dexpanthenol promotes wound healing and protects the mucosal lining.

## **Alternate Names**

* Xylometazoline hydrochloride + Dexpanthenol
* Septanazal
* Otrivin Plus Dexpanthenol (and other brand names varying by region)
* Nasasyn
* ratioSoft plus Dexpanthenol

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Oxymetazoline acts as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, primarily stimulating alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the nasal mucosa. This leads to vasoconstriction, reducing blood flow and subsequently decreasing nasal congestion. Dexpanthenol, a provitamin of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), is metabolized to pantothenic acid, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the nasal mucosa and promoting tissue regeneration.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Oxymetazoline exhibits limited systemic absorption following intranasal administration. Dexpanthenol is absorbed through the nasal mucosa and converted to pantothenic acid. Both drugs are primarily excreted via renal and fecal pathways.

**Mode of Action:**  Oxymetazoline binds to alpha-2 adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle in the nasal mucosa. This receptor activation triggers a signaling cascade, leading to vasoconstriction. Dexpanthenol is converted into pantothenic acid, which is essential for coenzyme A synthesis. Coenzyme A is vital for cellular metabolism and is directly involved in wound healing and tissue regeneration within the nasal mucosa.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Oxymetazoline is an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist. No significant enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation occurs with dexpanthenol.

**Elimination Pathways:** Both oxymetazoline and dexpanthenol are primarily eliminated through renal (urine) and fecal (stool) routes.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Nasal Spray: 1-2 sprays (containing 0.05% oxymetazoline and 5% dexpanthenol) in each nostril every 10-12 hours.

Nasal Drops: 2-3 drops (0.05% oxymetazoline and 5% dexpanthenol solution) in each nostril every 10-12 hours.

Maximum Dosage: Do not exceed 2 doses in a 24-hour period or use for more than 3-5 days. Prolonged use can lead to rebound congestion.

#### **Children:**

Ages 6-11: 2-3 sprays/drops (0.025-0.05% oxymetazoline solution, depending on the product and 5% dexpanthenol) in each nostril every 10-12 hours. Do not exceed 2 doses in a 24-hour period or use for more than 3 days.

Under 6 Years: Use is generally not recommended due to lack of safety and efficacy data.


#### **Special Cases:**

**Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to potential for cardiovascular side effects. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate.

**Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dose adjustments may be necessary.

**Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dose adjustments may be necessary.

**Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, and enlarged prostate. Close monitoring is recommended.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

D-Panthenol + Oxymetazoline is not typically used in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary indication is for the short-term relief of nasal congestion related to upper respiratory tract infections or allergies.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be necessary based on individual patient response and tolerance. In patients with renal or hepatic impairment, dose adjustments should be considered based on the severity of the dysfunction.  Patients with comorbid conditions, particularly cardiovascular diseases or glaucoma, require close monitoring.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Nasal burning or stinging
* Sneezing
* Dryness of the nasal mucosa
* Runny nose



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Hypertension (elevated blood pressure)
* Rebound congestion (worsening of congestion after discontinuation)
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Insomnia
* Tremors
* Anxiety
* Irritability


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Rhinitis medicamentosa (rebound congestion) can develop with prolonged use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe rebound congestion, allergic reactions, cardiovascular effects (tachycardia, hypertension).


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to oxymetazoline or dexpanthenol
* Dry inflammation of the nasal mucosa (rhinitis sicca)
* History of transsphenoidal hypophysectomy or other nasal surgeries exposing the dura mater
* Narrow-angle glaucoma
* Severe cardiovascular disease (e.g., coronary artery disease, uncontrolled hypertension)
* Pheochromocytoma
* Concomitant use or recent use (within 14 days) of MAO inhibitors.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **MAO inhibitors:** Co-administration can cause a hypertensive crisis.
* **Tricyclic antidepressants:** May potentiate the pressor effects of oxymetazoline.
* **Other sympathomimetics:** Additive effects on cardiovascular and central nervous systems.
* **Beta-blockers:** May diminish the antihypertensive effects of beta-blockers.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Use is not recommended due to limited data on safety and potential risks to the fetus.

* **Breastfeeding:**  Use is not recommended as it is unknown if oxymetazoline is excreted in breast milk and a risk to the infant cannot be excluded.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Oxymetazoline: alpha-adrenergic agonist causing vasoconstriction. Dexpanthenol: enhances mucosal healing and protection.
* **Side Effects:** Common: nasal burning/stinging, sneezing, dryness. Serious: tachycardia, hypertension, rebound congestion.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, rhinitis sicca, recent nasal surgery, narrow-angle glaucoma, severe cardiovascular disease, pheochromocytoma, concomitant MAOI use.
