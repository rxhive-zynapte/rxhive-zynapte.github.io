## **Usage**

- D-Panthenol + Thiamine is prescribed for the treatment and prevention of thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, often in combination with other B vitamins.  Conditions it is used for include beriberi, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (a neurological disorder caused by thiamine deficiency), and nutritional deficiencies, especially in patients receiving parenteral nutrition or those with malabsorption issues.  D-Panthenol, the provitamin of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), is included to support skin health, wound healing, and overall metabolic function.

- **Pharmacological classification:**  Vitamin supplement, nutritional agent.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Thiamine acts as a coenzyme in carbohydrate metabolism, crucial for energy production, and plays a vital role in nerve function. D-Panthenol is converted to pantothenic acid in the body, which is essential for the synthesis of coenzyme A, a key component in various metabolic processes including fatty acid synthesis and energy production.

## **Alternate Names**

-  No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination. However, the components may be referred to as vitamin B1 (thiamine) and provitamin B5 or pantothenol (D-panthenol).

-  Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and formulation.  This combination is often found in multivitamin preparations that may include other B vitamins.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Thiamine is crucial for carbohydrate metabolism, especially in the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, a key step in the Krebs cycle.  It also plays a vital role in nerve conduction.  Pantothenic acid, derived from D-panthenol, is essential for Coenzyme A synthesis, which is involved in fatty acid metabolism, acetylcholine synthesis, and steroid hormone production.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Thiamine is absorbed in the small intestine by active transport and passive diffusion. It's phosphorylated to its active form, thiamine pyrophosphate, within cells.  It is widely distributed throughout the body but is not stored extensively.  Excess thiamine is excreted in urine.  D-Panthenol is readily absorbed and rapidly converted to pantothenic acid, which is widely distributed in tissues.  Pantothenic acid is also excreted primarily in the urine.

- **Mode of action:** Thiamine pyrophosphate acts as a cofactor for several enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, such as pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.  It's also important for the synthesis of neurotransmitters like acetylcholine and GABA.  Pantothenic acid, as part of Coenzyme A, plays a crucial role in acyl group transfer reactions, including fatty acid metabolism and the citric acid cycle.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Both thiamine and pantothenic acid are primarily eliminated via renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Dosage depends on the indication and severity of deficiency. For mild thiamine deficiency, 25-100 mg daily is typical.  For severe deficiency (e.g., Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome), higher doses (up to 300 mg daily) may be given initially, often parenterally. D-Panthenol dosage varies depending on the specific formulation.

#### **Children:** Pediatric dosing should be individualized based on the child's age, weight, and clinical condition.  Consult pediatric dosing guidelines or a pharmacist for specific recommendations.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Close monitoring is recommended due to potential age-related decline in renal function. Dose adjustment may be necessary based on renal function.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Thiamine dose reduction is necessary in moderate to severe renal impairment.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Careful monitoring is recommended. Dose adjustments may be required for D-Panthenol.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized assessment is needed, considering potential drug interactions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for these specific clinical settings can vary significantly depending on the patient's individual needs and should be determined by the treating physician:

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations**

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications should be based on patient-specific factors such as renal function, hepatic function, and other relevant medical conditions.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Generally well-tolerated. Rare instances of mild gastrointestinal upset, sweating, skin rash, or injection site reactions (if administered parenterally) have been reported.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Rare allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis (especially with intravenous administration).

### **Long-Term Effects**

No significant long-term adverse effects are known with this combination when used as directed.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Anaphylaxis is a rare but serious ADR.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to thiamine, D-panthenol, or any component of the formulation.



## **Drug Interactions**

- Thiamine can interact with certain medications, including loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and some antibiotics, potentially reducing thiamine levels.  
- Antacids may decrease thiamine absorption.
- Alcohol can worsen thiamine deficiency.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding at recommended doses. Consult a physician to ensure appropriate use and discuss potential risks and benefits.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

Refer to sections above for detailed explanations.


## **Popular Combinations**

Frequently combined with other B vitamins, including pyridoxine (B6), cyanocobalamin (B12), and riboflavin (B2).  These combinations offer synergistic benefits in treating B vitamin deficiencies.


## **Precautions**

- Screen for hypersensitivity.
- Assess risk/benefit during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
- Consult guidelines for pediatric use.
- Consider renal function in elderly patients.
- Advise against excessive alcohol consumption.
