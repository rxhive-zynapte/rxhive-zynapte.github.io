      How does Daclatasvir + Sofosbuvir interact with other medications?**

      **A:** Daclatasvir is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and is also a P-gp
      inhibitor. Sofosbuvir is a substrate of P-gp. Co-administration with
      CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors, certain HIV medications, or amiodarone can
      lead to clinically significant drug interactions.

## **Usage**

- Daclatasvir + Sofosbuvir is prescribed for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in adults and children weighing at least 14 kg.  It is a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimen.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Direct-acting antiviral (DAA).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Daclatasvir is an NS5A inhibitor, while Sofosbuvir is an NS5B nucleotide polymerase inhibitor. Together, they target different stages of the HCV lifecycle, blocking viral replication and reducing the viral load.

## **Alternate Names**

-  Daclatasvir/Sofosbuvir, Sofosbuvir/Daclatasvir
- **Brand Names:**  Daklinza/Sovaldi, Darvoni, Sovodak


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Daclatasvir and Sofosbuvir act synergistically to inhibit HCV replication. Daclatasvir targets the NS5A protein, which is essential for viral replication and assembly, while Sofosbuvir, a prodrug, is metabolized into its active form (GS-461203), which inhibits the NS5B RNA polymerase, another key enzyme required for HCV replication.  This combined action disrupts multiple steps in the HCV lifecycle, leading to a significant reduction in viral load.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Daclatasvir is absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1-2 hours. It has a terminal half-life of 12â€“15 hours and is primarily excreted in feces. Sofosbuvir is also absorbed orally and undergoes intracellular metabolism by hydrolase and nucleotide phosphorylation pathways to its active metabolite. It is eliminated through renal and biliary routes.
- **Mode of Action:**  Daclatasvir binds to the NS5A protein, disrupting its function in viral replication. Sofosbuvir's active metabolite acts as a chain terminator of RNA synthesis by the NS5B polymerase.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Daclatasvir is primarily eliminated via fecal excretion, while Sofosbuvir undergoes both renal and hepatic elimination.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 60 mg daclatasvir + 400 mg sofosbuvir once daily, taken orally with or without food, usually for 12 weeks. Duration of therapy can be extended to 24 weeks depending on HCV genotype and presence of cirrhosis.

#### **Children (weighing at least 14 kg):**

- Dosing is weight-based and determined by the physician. 

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is generally required unless there is significant renal or hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is required for daclatasvir. Sofosbuvir dose adjustments may be needed in severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment of daclatasvir or sofosbuvir is required for mild to moderate liver disease. Close monitoring is recommended for patients with decompensated cirrhosis.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Close monitoring is recommended, particularly for patients with diabetes (risk of hypoglycemia) or cardiovascular disease. 

### **Clinical Use Cases**
Daclatasvir + Sofosbuvir is specifically indicated for chronic HCV infection. It is not indicated for the listed use cases like Intubation, Surgical procedures, Mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or certain HIV antiviral agents: Daclatasvir dose reduced to 30 mg once daily.
- Patients receiving moderate CYP3A4 inducers or nevirapine: Daclatasvir dose increased to 90 mg once daily.
- Strong CYP3A4 inducers are contraindicated with daclatasvir.
