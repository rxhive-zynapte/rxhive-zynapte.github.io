## **Usage**

- Dapagliflozin + Gliclazide is prescribed for type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults to improve glycemic control when metformin monotherapy is insufficient.  It is specifically indicated for patients who have inadequate glycemic control with metformin alone or who are intolerant to metformin.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antidiabetic combination containing a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (Dapagliflozin) and a sulfonylurea (Gliclazide).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dapagliflozin inhibits SGLT2 in the kidneys, increasing urinary glucose excretion and lowering blood glucose levels. Gliclazide stimulates insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells, also reducing blood glucose.

## **Alternate Names**

- This combination medication currently does not have an International Nonproprietary Name (INN).  It is referred to by its constituent drug names.
- **Brand Names:**  While specific brand names can vary by region, examples include Xigduo XR (Fixed Dose Combination).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dapagliflozin works independently of insulin to promote glucose excretion. Gliclazide enhances insulin secretion, resulting in decreased hepatic glucose production and improved peripheral insulin sensitivity. The combined effect results in improved glycemic control.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Dapagliflozin:**  Absorption is rapid, with peak plasma concentration occurring within 2 hours.  It is primarily eliminated through renal excretion, with minor hepatic metabolism.
    - **Gliclazide:** Almost completely absorbed after oral administration. It is metabolized in the liver and its metabolites are excreted in urine and feces.
- **Mode of Action:**  Dapagliflozin inhibits SGLT2 in the renal proximal tubules, preventing glucose reabsorption.  Gliclazide binds to sulfonylurea receptors on pancreatic beta-cells, blocking ATP-sensitive potassium channels, leading to depolarization and insulin release.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Dapagliflozin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Gliclazide is metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and feces.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- The starting dose is typically Dapagliflozin 5 mg + Gliclazide 30 mg Modified Release (MR) once daily, taken with breakfast. The dose may be titrated up to Dapagliflozin 10 mg + Gliclazide MR up to 120 mg depending on individual glycemic response.
- It is essential to titrate Gliclazide individually based on the patient's current Gliclazide dose if transferring from Gliclazide monotherapy.


#### **Children:**  
- This combination is *not* recommended for use in children due to limited safety and efficacy data.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients**: Initiate at the lowest dose and titrate cautiously, considering renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**:
    - Moderate (eGFR 30-60 mL/min/1.73 m²): Dapagliflozin 5 mg once daily. Gliclazide dose should be adjusted based on renal function.
    - Severe (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m²): *Contraindicated*.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**:  Gliclazide dose adjustment might be needed. Close monitoring is necessary. Use with caution.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**:  Careful assessment is required, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease, as Dapagliflozin can cause volume depletion.


### **Clinical Use Cases**
- This medication is not indicated for use in intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its usage is limited to chronic management of type 2 diabetes.


### **Dosage Adjustments**
- Dose adjustments may be based on renal function, hepatic function, concomitant medications, and individual glycemic response.

## **Drug Interactions**
- **Insulin or other Sulfonylureas:** Increased risk of hypoglycemia. Dose adjustment might be needed.
- **Diuretics:** Increased risk of dehydration and hypotension.
- **CYP450 Inducers (e.g., rifampicin):** Decreased dapagliflozin efficacy.
- **Alcohol:** May potentiate the hypoglycemic effects.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Category C (Dapagliflozin), Category C (Gliclazide). *Contraindicated*. Not recommended as it may cause fetal harm.
