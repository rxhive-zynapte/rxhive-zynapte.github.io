## **Usage**

- Dapagliflozin + Linagliptin + Metformin is prescribed for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults, specifically to improve glycemic control when metformin monotherapy is insufficient.  It is also used to lower the risk of cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antidiabetic combination therapy, comprising a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (dapagliflozin), a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor (linagliptin), and a biguanide (metformin).
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination works synergistically through multiple mechanisms to lower blood glucose:
    * Dapagliflozin increases urinary glucose excretion by inhibiting SGLT2 in the kidneys.
    * Linagliptin increases incretin levels (GLP-1 and GIP), which stimulate insulin release and decrease glucagon secretion.
    * Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, reduces intestinal glucose absorption, and improves insulin sensitivity.


## **Alternate Names**

- There are no widely recognized alternate names for this specific three-drug combination. The individual components may be known by other names (e.g., dapagliflozin is sometimes referred to as BMS-512148).
- **Brand Names:**  This combination is available under various brand names depending on the region, such as *Trijardy XR* (when it contains empagliflozin instead of dapagliflozin).



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  The combined effect of the three drugs results in a significant reduction in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, and postprandial glucose. Dapagliflozin promotes weight loss through caloric loss in the urine, while linagliptin and metformin are generally weight-neutral or may promote modest weight loss.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    * **Dapagliflozin:**  Orally administered, rapidly absorbed, peak plasma concentration in 2 hours. Primarily eliminated through renal excretion (75%) and metabolism (21%), with a half-life of approximately 12 hours.
    * **Linagliptin:** Orally administered, rapidly absorbed, peak plasma concentration in 1-4 hours. Primarily eliminated through biliary/fecal excretion (85%), with a half-life of approximately 12 days.
    * **Metformin:** Orally administered, gradually absorbed.  Not metabolized and is excreted unchanged in the urine, with a half-life of approximately 6 hours.
- **Mode of Action:**  
    * Dapagliflozin:  Inhibits SGLT2 in the renal proximal tubules, blocking glucose reabsorption.
    * Linagliptin:  Reversibly inhibits DPP-4, the enzyme responsible for degrading incretins.
    * Metformin: Activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), leading to multiple downstream effects on glucose metabolism.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**  Dapagliflozin selectively binds to and inhibits SGLT2. Linagliptin selectively inhibits DPP-4.  Metformin does not bind to any known receptors.
- **Elimination Pathways:**
    * Dapagliflozin:  Renal and hepatic.
    * Linagliptin:  Biliary/fecal.
    * Metformin:  Renal.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Initial dose varies depending on the patient's current treatment. Usually starts with dapagliflozin 10mg + linagliptin 5mg + metformin 1000mg once daily.  Dose may be adjusted based on efficacy and tolerability up to a maximum of dapagliflozin 10mg + linagliptin 5mg + metformin 2000mg daily. If the total daily dose of Metformin should be 2000mg, the patient can take 2 pills which contain 5mg of dapagliflozin, 2.5mg of Linagliptin, and 1000mg of Metformin twice a day.
This fixed-dose combination comes in various formulations with different strengths and may need to be adjusted accordingly.

#### **Children:** This combination is not recommended for pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Dose adjustment may be required based on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) or end-stage renal disease. Dose adjustment required for moderate impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution should be exercised in patients with heart failure, urinary tract infections, dehydration, or volume depletion.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This specific drug combination does not have specific dosages for acute clinical situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use. Diabetic management in these situations requires individualized assessment and may involve insulin therapy.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are primarily based on renal function and individual patient response.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

-  Fournier's gangrene (rare)
- Bullous pemphigoid



### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Potential long-term effects are primarily related to chronic complications of diabetes and underlying cardiovascular disease.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Clinically significant ADRs require prompt discontinuation of the medication and supportive care. These include hypersensitivity reactions, acute pancreatitis, and ketoacidosis.


## **Contraindications**

- Severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease.
- Dialysis.
- Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication.
- Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis.

- Cationic drugs eliminated by renal tubular secretion (cimetidine): May increase metformin concentrations.
- Alcohol: Increased risk of lactic acidosis with metformin.
- Iodinated contrast media:  Increased risk of acute kidney injury.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Category C (consult a healthcare professional). Dapagliflozin is not recommended during pregnancy, especially the second and third trimesters. Linagliptin's safety in pregnancy has not been established. Metformin is generally considered safe in pregnancy, but insulin is preferred.
