## **Usage**

- Dapagliflozin + Linagliptin is prescribed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults. It is used as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy. It helps lower the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antidiabetic combination, comprised of a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (dapagliflozin) and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor (linagliptin).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dapagliflozin increases urinary glucose excretion by inhibiting SGLT2 in the kidneys, thereby lowering blood glucose levels. Linagliptin increases incretin levels (GLP-1 and GIP) by inhibiting DPP-4, which in turn increases insulin secretion and decreases glucagon secretion.  The combined effect of both drugs helps in better control of blood sugar levels.

## **Alternate Names**

- No commonly used alternate generic names.
- **Brand Names:** Qtern, Trajenta Duo


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dapagliflozin reduces renal glucose reabsorption, leading to glycosuria and lowering blood glucose levels. Linagliptin prolongs the action of incretins, resulting in enhanced glucose-dependent insulin secretion and reduced glucagon secretion.  Both contribute to improved glycemic control without increasing insulin resistance.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Dapagliflozin:**  Oral bioavailability is 78%. Peak plasma concentration is reached within 2 hours under fasting conditions. High-fat meals can delay and reduce peak concentration but don't affect overall exposure. Primarily metabolized by glucuronidation; eliminated through urine and feces.
    - **Linagliptin:**  Oral bioavailability is approximately 30%.  High-fat meals delay peak concentration but don't impact overall exposure. Primarily metabolized by biliary/fecal excretion with minimal renal elimination.
- **Mode of Action:**  Dapagliflozin inhibits SGLT2 in the renal proximal tubules, preventing glucose reabsorption. Linagliptin inhibits DPP-4 enzyme, preventing incretin degradation.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Dapagliflozin targets SGLT2 receptors. Linagliptin inhibits DPP-4 enzyme.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Dapagliflozin mainly via biliary/fecal excretion; some renal excretion. Linagliptin predominantly via biliary/fecal excretion, minimal renal elimination.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial:  Dapagliflozin 5mg + Linagliptin 5mg once daily in the morning.  Can increase to Dapagliflozin 10 mg + Linagliptin 5 mg once daily for additional glycemic control.
- Maximum:  Dapagliflozin 10mg + Linagliptin 5mg per day.
- Administration: Oral, can be taken with or without food.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age. Safety and effectiveness have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Assess renal function and volume status before initiating treatment. Monitor for signs and symptoms of volume depletion.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    - eGFR 45 mL/min/1.73m² or greater: Standard dosing.
    - eGFR 25 to <45 mL/min/1.73m²: Dapagliflozin 10 mg + Linagliptin 5 mg once daily.
    - eGFR less than 25 mL/min/1.73m²: Not recommended to initiate; if already on therapy, may continue at 10mg/5mg to reduce risk of eGFR decline and cardiovascular events.
    - Dialysis: Contraindicated.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is generally required. However, monitor closely.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful assessment of volume status and renal function is essential in patients with cardiovascular disease or those on diuretics. Monitor for signs and symptoms of volume depletion. For patients with a history of pancreatitis, use with caution.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Not indicated for use in clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dosage adjustments are mainly based on renal function (see "Special Cases: Patients with Renal Impairment").


## **Side Effects**

- **CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin):** May decrease linagliptin levels.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
