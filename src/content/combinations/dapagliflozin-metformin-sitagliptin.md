## **Usage**

- This combination drug is prescribed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults when blood sugar levels are not adequately controlled by metformin alone or in combination with either dapagliflozin or sitagliptin.  It is also indicated to reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antidiabetic combination therapy comprising a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (dapagliflozin), a biguanide (metformin), and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor (sitagliptin).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dapagliflozin increases urinary glucose excretion. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production and increases insulin sensitivity. Sitagliptin increases incretin levels, leading to increased insulin secretion and decreased glucagon secretion.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely used alternate names exist for this specific combination product.
- **Brand Names:** This combination is available under various brand names depending on the region and manufacturer. Qternmet XR is one example.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The combined effects of the three drugs improve glycemic control by targeting different aspects of glucose regulation. Dapagliflozin acts independently of insulin to increase urinary glucose excretion. Metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and enhances insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. Sitagliptin augments incretin hormone levels, stimulating glucose-dependent insulin release and suppressing glucagon secretion.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Dapagliflozin is primarily eliminated via renal excretion, while metformin is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine.  Sitagliptin is predominantly eliminated via hepatic metabolism, with a minor portion excreted renally. The pharmacokinetic profiles of each component are not significantly altered when administered in combination.
- **Mode of Action:** Dapagliflozin inhibits SGLT2 in the renal proximal tubules, blocking glucose reabsorption. Metformin activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), impacting various metabolic pathways involved in glucose regulation. Sitagliptin inhibits DPP-4, the enzyme responsible for degrading incretin hormones like glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP).
- **Elimination Pathways:** Dapagliflozin: Renal excretion (primarily). Metformin: Renal excretion (primarily). Sitagliptin: Hepatic metabolism (primarily), with some renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Starting dose is individualized based on the patient's current regimen.
- Usual starting dose: Dapagliflozin 5 mg or 10 mg once daily, metformin 500 mg or 1000 mg twice daily, and sitagliptin 50 mg or 100 mg once daily.
- Maximum dose: Dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily, metformin 2000 mg daily, and sitagliptin 100 mg once daily.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate therapy cautiously, considering renal function. Dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustments are necessary based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).  Contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Metformin should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Dapagliflozin and sitagliptin can generally be used without dose adjustments.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Assess for potential drug interactions and contraindications based on individual patient conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- This combination medication is specifically designed for the management of type 2 diabetes and is not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

-  Adjustments are based on patient-specific factors, including renal function, hepatic function, and concomitant medications.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**
