      factors like glycemic stability, presence of comorbidities, and risk of
      adverse effects. Routine monitoring should include A1c, renal function,
      and liver function tests.

## **Usage**

- This triple-drug combination is prescribed for the management of **Type II Diabetes Mellitus** in adults when metformin monotherapy or dual therapy with metformin and another antidiabetic agent (like vildagliptin or dapagliflozin) does not provide adequate glycemic control.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antidiabetic combination comprising a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (dapagliflozin), a biguanide (metformin), and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor (vildagliptin).
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination works through three distinct mechanisms to lower blood glucose:
    * Dapagliflozin increases urinary glucose excretion by inhibiting SGLT2 in the kidneys.
    * Metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and improves insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues.
    * Vildagliptin enhances incretin activity by inhibiting DPP-4, leading to increased insulin secretion and decreased glucagon secretion.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names for this specific triple combination exist.
- **Brand Names:**  While a specific brand name for this triple combination wasn't found in the provided sources, each component is available under various brand names (e.g., Forxiga for dapagliflozin, Glucophage for metformin, Galvus for vildagliptin).  Fixed-dose combinations of two of the three drugs are available (e.g., Xigduo for dapagliflozin + metformin).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  The combined effect of the three drugs results in a significant reduction in HbA1c and improved glycemic control.  Dapagliflozin promotes glucosuria, metformin improves insulin action and reduces hepatic glucose output, and vildagliptin increases glucose-dependent insulin secretion.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    * **Dapagliflozin:**  Orally administered, peak plasma concentration achieved within 2 hours, primarily excreted unchanged in urine.
    * **Metformin:**  Orally administered, peak plasma levels reached in 2.5 hours (immediate release) or 7 hours (extended release), excreted unchanged in urine.
    * **Vildagliptin:** Orally administered, rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations within 1.75 hours, primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism (85%) and renal excretion (15%).
- **Mode of Action:**
    * Dapagliflozin: Inhibits SGLT2 in the renal proximal tubules, blocking glucose reabsorption.
    * Metformin:  Reduces hepatic glucose production, possibly via activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).  Increases peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.
    * Vildagliptin: Inhibits DPP-4, preventing the degradation of incretin hormones like GLP-1 and GIP, leading to enhanced glucose-dependent insulin secretion.
- **Elimination Pathways:**
    * Dapagliflozin: Primarily renal excretion.
    * Metformin: Renal excretion.
    * Vildagliptin: Hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The dosage should be individualized based on the patient's current regimen, glycemic control, and tolerability.
- Typically, the starting dose is based on the doses of metformin, vildagliptin and dapagliflozin the patient was taking individually.
- No fixed-dose combination of all three drugs was found in the provided sources; dosing will involve separate medications or two-drug combination pills plus the third drug.


#### **Children:**  Not recommended for patients under 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Due to potential age-related decline in renal function, metformin dosage should be carefully titrated and renal function monitored.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Use with caution in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment; contraindicated in severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m²) or end-stage renal disease.  Metformin dosage needs adjustment based on eGFR. Dapagliflozin is less effective with declining eGFR and should not be started if eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m².
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.  Metformin should be used with caution in moderate hepatic impairment. Dapagliflozin exposure may be increased in hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with heart failure, history of pancreatitis, or other conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  Information specific to these use cases for this drug combination was not found.  Type II diabetes management is the primary indication.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments are based on renal function, hepatic function, and individual patient response.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
- Headache
- Upper respiratory tract infection
- Genital infections (e.g., vulvovaginitis, balanitis)
- Urinary tract infections
- Hypoglycemia

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Lactic acidosis (metformin)
- Ketoacidosis
- Angioedema
- Acute pancreatitis
- Severe hypoglycemia


### **Long-Term Effects**
- Vitamin B12 deficiency (metformin)



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**  The listed Rare but Serious side effects would constitute ADRs requiring attention.


## **Contraindications**
