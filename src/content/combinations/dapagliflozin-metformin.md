## **Usage**

- Dapagliflozin + Metformin is prescribed as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It's also used to lower the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors.  Additionally, it's indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and urgent heart failure visits in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and to lower the risk of worsening of kidney disease, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic kidney disease.  It is not indicated for type 1 diabetes.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antidiabetic combination; SGLT2 inhibitor + Biguanide
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dapagliflozin inhibits sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) in the kidneys, increasing urinary glucose excretion and lowering blood glucose levels. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, reduces intestinal glucose absorption, and improves insulin sensitivity.

## **Alternate Names**

- While there isn't a true "alternate name," Dapagliflozin and Metformin are often referred to as an "SGLT2 inhibitor/Biguanide combination."
- **Brand Names:** Xigduo XR, Xigduo.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dapagliflozin works independently of insulin to promote urinary glucose excretion. Metformin reduces hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. The combination has additive effects on lowering blood glucose.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Dapagliflozin:**  Orally administered dapagliflozin is rapidly absorbed, achieving peak plasma concentrations within 2 hours. It is approximately 91% protein-bound, primarily to albumin.  It is mainly metabolized via glucuronidation by uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A9, with a minor contribution from CYP2C9. It is eliminated through both urinary and fecal excretion, mostly as metabolites.
    - **Metformin:**  Metformin is absorbed slowly and incompletely from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.  It is minimally protein-bound and distributes widely to tissues.  It is not metabolized and is eliminated primarily through renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** Dapagliflozin inhibits SGLT2 in the renal proximal tubules, preventing glucose reabsorption and leading to glucosuria. Metformin's precise mechanism is unclear but involves inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex 1, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and possibly changes in gut microbiota.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Dapagliflozin specifically targets SGLT2. Metformin's action involves multiple pathways, including AMPK activation and modulation of mitochondrial function.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Dapagliflozin is primarily excreted via urine (75%) and feces (21%), primarily as dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide. Metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Initial dose:** Dapagliflozin 5 mg + Metformin 500 mg or 1000 mg orally once daily with a meal, or as directed by the physician.
- **Maintenance dose:**  May be adjusted based on efficacy and tolerability up to a maximum of Dapagliflozin 10 mg + Metformin 2000 mg per day. If taking an evening dose of metformin XR, skip the last dose before starting the combination therapy.  For patients requiring 5 mg dapagliflozin and 2000 mg metformin extended release, use two of the 2.5 mg dapagliflozin / 1000 mg metformin XR tablets.

#### **Children:**

-  Not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate and titrate cautiously due to potential age-related decline in renal function. Monitor renal function closely.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). Not recommended for initiation in patients with eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Maximum daily dose for eGFR 30 - 45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> is 10 mg dapagliflozin and 1000 mg metformin.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment due to the presence of metformin.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Assess for volume depletion before initiating therapy and correct if present. Use with caution in patients with a history of heart failure.
