## **Usage**

- Dapagliflozin + Pioglitazone is prescribed for type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults to improve glycemic control when metformin alone or in combination with other antidiabetic agents (including insulin) does not provide adequate glycemic control.
- **Pharmacological classification:**  Antidiabetic combination comprised of a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (dapagliflozin) and a thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dapagliflozin inhibits SGLT2 in the kidneys, reducing glucose reabsorption and increasing urinary glucose excretion. Pioglitazone enhances insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues (muscle, liver, and adipose tissue) by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ).

## **Alternate Names**

- No commonly used alternate generic names.
- **Brand Names:** Qtern, Xigduo XR


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dapagliflozin exerts its effect by promoting glucosuria, independent of insulin secretion or action. Pioglitazone improves insulin sensitivity, thereby enhancing glucose uptake and utilization by peripheral tissues. It also decreases hepatic glucose output.  The combined effect lowers blood glucose levels. This combination can also modestly lower systolic blood pressure.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - **Dapagliflozin:** Rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentration reached within 2 hours. Primarily metabolized by UGT1A9 to dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide (inactive metabolite). Excreted in urine (75%) and feces (21%).
    - **Pioglitazone:** Well absorbed following oral administration, reaching peak plasma levels in 2-4 hours. Extensively metabolized by the liver, primarily via CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. Elimination half-life of 3-7 hours. Excreted primarily in bile and feces.
- **Mode of Action:** Dapagliflozin acts by inhibiting SGLT2 in the renal proximal tubule. Pioglitazone activates PPAR-γ, a nuclear receptor that regulates gene expression involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. 
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Pioglitazone is a PPAR-γ agonist. Dapagliflozin inhibits SGLT2.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Dapagliflozin is primarily excreted in urine as dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide. Pioglitazone is excreted mainly in feces via biliary elimination.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial:  Dapagliflozin 5 mg + Pioglitazone 15 mg orally once daily with or without food.
- If glycemic control is inadequate, the dose may be increased to Dapagliflozin 10 mg + Pioglitazone 30 mg once daily or 45 mg once daily, as tolerated.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for patients under 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate with lowest dose (Dapagliflozin 5 mg + Pioglitazone 15 mg) due to increased risk of volume depletion and monitor closely.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** 
  -  eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m²: No dose adjustment.
  -  eGFR 45 - <60 mL/min/1.73 m²: Dapagliflozin 5 mg + Pioglitazone starting dose depending on renal function. Maximum daily dose 5 mg for dapagliflozin. Not recommended if on dialysis.
  - eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² and dialysis: Not recommended.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment necessary for mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Use with caution in severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor carefully for volume depletion, especially in those with heart failure or on diuretics.  If starting patient with eGFR between 45-60 start with lowest available dose.
