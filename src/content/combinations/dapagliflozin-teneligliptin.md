      What is the recommended dosage for Dapagliflozin + Teneligliptin?**

      **A:**  The standard adult dose is Dapagliflozin 5-10 mg + Teneligliptin
      20 mg once daily, usually in the morning. Not recommended for children.
      Dose adjustments may be necessary based on renal function and other
      factors.

  - q: >-
      How does this combination compare to other diabetes medications?**

      **A:**  It offers dual action by targeting both glucose reabsorption and
      incretin activity.  It might be more effective in certain patients
      compared to monotherapy with either an SGLT2 inhibitor or a DPP-4
      inhibitor alone.

      Can this combination be used in patients with kidney disease?**

      **A:**  It is not recommended for glycemic control for T2DM patients with
      an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m².  However, patients with HF or CKD and eGFR <
      45 mL/min/1.73 m² can use it for reducing risk of CKD progression and
      cardiovascular death;  if eGFR drops below 25 ml/min/1.73 m², initiation
      is not recommended, but existing patients with HF or CKD may continue.
      Contraindicated in patients on dialysis or with ESRD.

      **A:** Take the missed dose as soon as remembered. However, if it is
      almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with the
      regular schedule. Do not double the dose.

      Are there any interactions with alcohol?**

      **A:**  While no specific interactions are listed in the sources, alcohol
      can increase the risk of hypoglycemia, particularly in patients also
      taking insulin or sulfonylureas. Advise patients to monitor blood glucose
      carefully and seek medical advice if needed.

## **Usage**

- Dapagliflozin + Teneligliptin is prescribed for type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise, particularly in patients with comorbidities. It helps improve glycemic control and prevent associated complications.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antidiabetic combination medication consisting of a SGLT2 inhibitor (Dapagliflozin) and a DPP-4 inhibitor (Teneligliptin).
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Dapagliflozin inhibits sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) in the kidneys, reducing glucose reabsorption and increasing urinary glucose excretion. Teneligliptin inhibits dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), increasing incretin hormone levels (like GLP-1 and GIP), which enhance insulin secretion and suppress glucagon release. This combined action effectively lowers blood glucose levels.

## **Alternate Names**

- No internationally recognized alternate names are found in the sources, however, several brand names exist.
- **Brand Names:** Zita D, Glidapa Tene (various strengths).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dapagliflozin lowers blood glucose independently of insulin by increasing urinary glucose excretion. Teneligliptin enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppresses glucagon release, improving glycemic control after meals and during fasting states. The combination offers synergistic blood sugar control.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Dapagliflozin is primarily eliminated through renal excretion. Teneligliptin is metabolized, with metabolites primarily excreted renally and some hepatically.
- **Mode of Action:** Dapagliflozin acts on SGLT2 transporters in the kidneys, while Teneligliptin inhibits the DPP-4 enzyme.
- **Receptor binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Dapagliflozin targets SGLT2 transporters. Teneligliptin inhibits the DPP-4 enzyme.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Dapagliflozin is mainly eliminated by renal excretion. Teneligliptin metabolites are excreted renally and hepatically.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Dapagliflozin + Teneligliptin is available in fixed-dose combinations of Dapagliflozin 5mg/10mg + Teneligliptin 20mg.
- The usual starting dose is Dapagliflozin 5mg + Teneligliptin 20mg orally once daily, taken in the morning with or without food. The dose may be increased to Dapagliflozin 10mg + Teneligliptin 20mg if needed for better glycemic control.

#### **Children:**

- Dapagliflozin + Teneligliptin is not recommended for children as safety and effectiveness have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Caution is advised, particularly with Dapagliflozin, as elderly patients may be more susceptible to volume depletion. Renal function should be monitored.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  For patients with eGFR ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m², no dose adjustment is needed. For eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m², the use of Dapagliflozin + Teneligliptin is not recommended for improving glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. However, for patients with heart failure or CKD, no dosage adjustment is needed for Dapagliflozin component. If eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73 m², initiation of Dapagliflozin + Teneligliptin is not recommended; however, those already using it for HF or CKD can continue at 10mg dapagliflozin.  ESRD/dialysis patients: Dapagliflozin + Teneligliptin is contraindicated.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Mild to moderate impairment requires no dosage adjustment. Severe hepatic impairment has not been studied.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, especially heart failure. Close monitoring is needed.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources do not detail specific dosage recommendations for clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Dosing is primarily guided by glycemic control in patients with Type 2 diabetes, heart failure or chronic kidney disease. For special circumstances, expert consultation is recommended.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on renal function, patient response, and potential drug interactions. See "Special Cases" above for renal impairment considerations.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Urinary tract infections (UTIs)
- Increased urination
- Genital mycotic infections (e.g., genital yeast infections)
- Nasopharyngitis (common cold symptoms)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), especially with concomitant use of insulin or sulfonylureas
- Diabetic ketoacidosis
-  Serious hypersensitivity reactions

### **Long-Term Effects**

No specific long-term adverse effects unique to this combination are highlighted in the provided sources beyond those listed above. Monitor for potential renal complications and cardiovascular events.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Angioedema (swelling of face, lips, tongue, throat)
- Steven-Johnson syndrome (severe skin reaction)


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to Dapagliflozin or Teneligliptin
- Severe renal impairment, end-stage renal disease, or patients on dialysis
- Type 1 diabetes

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Dapagliflozin is not recommended during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy due to potential renal risks to the fetus. Teneligliptin information is limited. Discuss potential risks with pregnant patients.  Alternative diabetes medications, such as insulin and metformin, are safer.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Dapagliflozin passes into breast milk, potentially lowering the baby’s blood sugar and impacting kidney development. Teneligliptin information is limited. Consult with patients regarding breastfeeding. Consider alternative therapies if needed.
