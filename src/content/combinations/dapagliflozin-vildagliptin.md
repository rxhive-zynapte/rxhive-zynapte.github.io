## **Usage**

- Dapagliflozin + Vildagliptin is prescribed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults when diet and exercise alone do not provide adequate glycemic control.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antidiabetic combination drug comprising a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (Dapagliflozin) and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor (Vildagliptin).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dapagliflozin increases urinary glucose excretion by inhibiting SGLT2 in the kidneys. Vildagliptin increases the levels of incretin hormones, which stimulate insulin release and decrease glucagon secretion, thereby improving glycemic control.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for the combination.
- **Brand Names:** This combination is available under various brand names, which can differ regionally.  Some examples of brand names found are Vildapin DP, Vilingtin DZ, Dapatees V SR.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dapagliflozin reduces renal glucose reabsorption, leading to increased urinary glucose excretion and lowered blood glucose levels.  Vildagliptin enhances incretin hormone action, which increases glucose-dependent insulin secretion and reduces glucagon secretion, primarily in the postprandial state.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Both drugs are orally administered. Dapagliflozin is primarily eliminated via renal excretion, while Vildagliptin is eliminated through both hepatic metabolism and renal excretion. 
- **Mode of Action:** Dapagliflozin acts by directly inhibiting SGLT2 in the renal proximal tubules, blocking glucose reabsorption. Vildagliptin inhibits DPP-4, the enzyme responsible for degrading incretin hormones. This leads to increased levels of active GLP-1 and GIP.  
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Dapagliflozin targets SGLT2 receptors. Vildagliptin inhibits the DPP-4 enzyme.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Dapagliflozin is primarily excreted renally. Vildagliptin is both metabolized hepatically and excreted renally.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The starting dose is typically Dapagliflozin 5 mg + Vildagliptin 50 mg once daily, taken orally in the morning.
- The dose may be increased to Dapagliflozin 10 mg + Vildagliptin 50 mg or Dapagliflozin 10 mg + Vildagliptin 100 mg (sustained-release formulation) once daily, depending on glycemic control and patient tolerance.

#### **Children:**

- The safety and efficacy of Dapagliflozin + Vildagliptin have not been established in pediatric patients. Use is not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment may be needed based on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction or avoidance may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment. For eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73 m², the combination is generally not recommended for glycemic control, although Dapagliflozin may be continued for cardiorenal benefits.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution should be exercised.  A starting dose of Dapagliflozin 5 mg is recommended in severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful assessment and dose adjustment may be required in patients with cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or other comorbidities.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  
Dapagliflozin + Vildagliptin is not indicated for:
- Intubation
- Surgical Procedures
- Mechanical Ventilation
- Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use
- Emergency Situations

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on renal function, hepatic function, and individual patient response to therapy.
