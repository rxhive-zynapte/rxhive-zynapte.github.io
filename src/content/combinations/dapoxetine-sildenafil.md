## **Usage**

- Dapoxetine + Sildenafil is prescribed for the treatment of premature ejaculation (PE) in men who also have erectile dysfunction (ED).  
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Dapoxetine is a short-acting selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor.  
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dapoxetine increases serotonin levels in the brain, which delays ejaculation. Sildenafil enhances blood flow to the penis by inhibiting PDE5, facilitating erection.

## **Alternate Names**

- While the combination itself doesn't have a distinct international nonproprietary name (INN), its components do: dapoxetine hydrochloride and sildenafil citrate.  
- **Brand Names:**  The combination is available under various brand names globally, which can vary by region. Some examples include Super Welgra, Duralong, and Westoxetin-S.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dapoxetine inhibits the serotonin transporter, increasing serotonin's effect in the synapse, which is thought to delay ejaculation. Sildenafil inhibits PDE5, preventing the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the corpus cavernosum of the penis. This leads to smooth muscle relaxation, increased blood flow, and erection.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Dapoxetine is rapidly absorbed and metabolized primarily by the liver (CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes), with a short half-life. Sildenafil is also metabolized by the liver (CYP3A4) and has a half-life of approximately 4 hours.  Both drugs are primarily excreted via renal and fecal pathways.
- **Mode of Action:** Dapoxetine's action is related to serotonin reuptake inhibition at the presynaptic neuron. Sildenafil acts by selectively inhibiting PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum, leading to vasodilation.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Dapoxetine inhibits the serotonin transporter. Sildenafil inhibits PDE5.
- **Elimination pathways:** Both dapoxetine and sildenafil are metabolized in the liver and excreted via renal and fecal routes.

## **Dosage**
