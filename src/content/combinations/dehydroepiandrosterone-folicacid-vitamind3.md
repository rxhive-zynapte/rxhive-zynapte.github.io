## **Usage**

- This combination drug is primarily prescribed for **female infertility**, particularly in the context of assisted reproductive technology (ART) like in-vitro fertilization (IVF).  It aims to improve fertility rates by enhancing egg quality and promoting a healthy reproductive environment.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  This is a combination product containing a steroid hormone precursor (DHEA), a vitamin (folic acid), and a prohormone (vitamin D3). It could be classified under "Hormonal agents," "Vitamins," and "Dietary supplements."
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) acts as a precursor to androgens and estrogens, potentially improving ovarian function and egg quality. Folic acid is crucial for cell growth and development, supporting the developing fetus. Vitamin D3 plays a role in calcium absorption and bone health, which are important for reproductive health.  

## **Alternate Names**

- While this specific combination might not have an official international nonproprietary name (INN), it can be referred to by its constituent parts: Dehydroepiandrosterone, Folic Acid, and Vitamin D3 (or Cholecalciferol).
- **Brand Names:** Several brands market this combined formulation. Examples found in the source include Evaserve, Safeova, Adorefem, and Gynonorm DHEA.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** DHEA is metabolized into androgens (like testosterone) and estrogens in the body. In women with diminished ovarian reserve, DHEA supplementation may increase the number and quality of oocytes. Folic acid is essential for DNA synthesis, cell division, and red blood cell formation. Vitamin D3 facilitates calcium absorption and bone health.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **DHEA:**  Administered orally, DHEA is readily absorbed and metabolized primarily in the liver. It undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. DHEA and its metabolites are excreted in urine and feces.
    - **Folic acid:** Absorbed primarily in the small intestine.
    - **Vitamin D3:** Absorbed in the small intestine and further metabolized in the liver and kidneys.

- **Mode of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  DHEA exerts its effects by conversion to downstream sex hormones. It does not have specific receptor binding in its original form. Folic acid is a cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA synthesis. Vitamin D3 acts by binding to vitamin D receptors (VDRs).


- **Elimination Pathways:** DHEA metabolites are eliminated through renal and hepatic routes. Folic acid is eliminated primarily in urine. Vitamin D3 and its metabolites are excreted in bile and feces.
