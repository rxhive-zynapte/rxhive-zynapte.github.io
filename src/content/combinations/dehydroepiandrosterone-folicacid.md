## **Usage**

- This combination is primarily used as a supplement to address potential deficiencies in both dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and folic acid. DHEA is prescribed for conditions like adrenal insufficiency, hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women, and depression. Folic acid is crucial for cell growth and development, especially during pregnancy, and is used to prevent neural tube defects in developing fetuses and treat folic acid deficiency anemia.  It's important to note that while both are available over-the-counter, they should be taken under the guidance of a healthcare professional. The combined usage is not FDA-approved for any specific condition.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** DHEA can be classified as an endogenous hormone precursor/androgen. Folic acid is classified as a water-soluble vitamin, specifically a B vitamin.

- **Mechanism of Action:** DHEA acts as a precursor to androgens and estrogens, influencing various physiological processes, including sexual function, mood, and bone health. Folic acid is essential for DNA synthesis, cell division, and red blood cell production.


## **Alternate Names**

- **Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA):**  prasterone
- **Folic Acid:** folate, vitamin B9, pteroylmonoglutamic acid
- There are various brand names under which DHEA and folic acid, alone or in combination, are marketed.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics (DHEA):** DHEA is converted in the body to androgens and estrogens, influencing a wide range of physiological processes. Its effects depend on individual hormone levels and conversion rates.
- **Pharmacokinetics (DHEA):** DHEA is readily absorbed orally. It's metabolized in the liver and other tissues. Elimination occurs primarily through the kidneys.
- **Pharmacodynamics (Folic Acid):** Folic acid is converted to its active form, tetrahydrofolic acid, which is essential for one-carbon transfer reactions in various metabolic pathways.
- **Pharmacokinetics (Folic Acid):** Folic acid is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It's metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine.
- Specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation details are complex and depend on the downstream metabolites of DHEA.


## **Dosage**

Dosing of this combination isn't standardized.  Dosages are usually based on individual components.

### **Standard Dosage**  

#### **Adults (DHEA):** DHEA dosage varies widely depending on the condition being treated, typically ranging from 25 mg to 450 mg daily, sometimes divided into multiple doses.

#### **Adults (Folic Acid):**  For preventing neural tube defects, 400 mcg daily. For treating folic acid deficiency anemia, doses can range up to 5 mg daily.

#### **Children:** DHEA is generally not recommended for children. Folic acid dosage for children depends on age and health status.

#### **Special Cases:** DHEA dosage should be carefully considered and adjusted in elderly patients and those with renal or hepatic impairment. Folic acid dosage may need adjustment in patients with renal impairment.



### **Clinical Use Cases**  

The combination of DHEA and folic acid is not typically used in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**  

Dose adjustments for both DHEA and folic acid may be necessary based on individual patient factors, including renal or hepatic dysfunction and other health conditions.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects (DHEA):** Acne, oily skin, hirsutism, hair loss, deepened voice, increased aggression, insomnia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects (DHEA):** Liver damage, changes in cholesterol levels, increased risk of hormone-sensitive cancers.

### **Common Side Effects (Folic Acid):**  Generally well-tolerated, but high doses can cause abdominal discomfort, nausea, and flatulence.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects (Folic Acid):** Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling). Masking of vitamin B12 deficiency.


## **Contraindications**

### **DHEA:** Hormone-sensitive cancers (breast, prostate, ovarian), severe liver disease, pregnancy, breastfeeding.

### **Folic Acid:** Hypersensitivity to folic acid. Untreated vitamin B12 deficiency.


## **Drug Interactions**

### **DHEA:** May interact with insulin, anticoagulants, anticonvulsants, and other medications metabolized by the liver.

### **Folic Acid:**  May interact with certain anticonvulsants and medications used to treat cancer or rheumatoid arthritis.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

DHEA is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Folic acid is recommended during pregnancy for neural tube defect prevention. Its safety during breastfeeding is generally considered good.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

See above sections.


## **Popular Combinations**

DHEA is sometimes combined with other hormones in bioidentical hormone replacement therapy. Folic acid is often included in prenatal vitamins along with other essential nutrients.  The combination of DHEA and folic acid itself is not a commonly used or recommended practice.


## **Precautions**
