## **Usage**

This combination is primarily prescribed for **female infertility**, particularly in women undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF).  It aims to improve ovarian function, egg quality, and pregnancy rates. It may also be used as a nutritional supplement to address deficiencies in these components.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**  This combination includes an endogenous steroid hormone (DHEA), a B vitamin (L-methylfolate), and a fat-soluble vitamin (Vitamin D3). It could be categorized under endocrine agents, vitamin supplements, or fertility agents, depending on the specific use case.

- **Mechanism of Action:** DHEA acts as a precursor to both estrogen and testosterone, potentially improving ovarian reserve and egg quality. L-methylfolate, the active form of folic acid, is essential for DNA synthesis, cell division, and fetal development, reducing the risk of neural tube defects. Vitamin D3 supports calcium absorption and bone health, and may also play a role in ovarian function and reproductive health.

## **Alternate Names**

There isn't a universally recognized alternate name for this specific combination. However, the individual components are known by various names:

- **Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA):** Prasterone, androstenolone.
- **L-Methylfolate:** (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolate, 5-MTHF, levomefolic acid, metafolin.
- **Vitamin D3:** Cholecalciferol.

**Brand Names:** Examples of brand names include Ovigyn D3, Dheagyn Plus, Coedhea Plus.  (Note: Brand names can vary by region.)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** DHEA influences the production of androgens and estrogens, thus impacting reproductive function. L-methylfolate participates in one-carbon metabolism, vital for DNA synthesis, amino acid production, and various metabolic processes. Vitamin D3 regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis, affecting bone mineralization and potentially reproductive hormone levels.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **DHEA:** Administered orally. Metabolized in the liver and other tissues. Excreted primarily in urine.
    - **L-Methylfolate:**  Administered orally. Converted to other folate forms as needed. Excreted in urine.
    - **Vitamin D3:**  Administered orally.  Metabolized in the liver and kidneys to its active form, calcitriol. Excreted in bile and urine.

- **Mode of Action:**  DHEA interacts with steroid hormone receptors, influencing the production of sex hormones. L-methylfolate acts as a cofactor in enzymatic reactions involved in nucleotide synthesis. Vitamin D3 binds to the vitamin D receptor, modulating gene expression related to calcium and phosphate transport.
