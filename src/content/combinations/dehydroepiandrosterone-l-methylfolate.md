## **Usage**

- This drug combination is primarily prescribed for **female infertility**, particularly in women with diminished ovarian reserve undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF).  It aims to improve ovarian function and enhance egg quality.  L-methylfolate, the active form of folic acid, is crucial for cell growth and development, playing a vital role in early pregnancy.

- **Pharmacological Classification**:  This combination falls under multiple classifications:
    - Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA):  Endogenous steroid hormone precursor, sometimes classified as an androgen.
    - L-Methylfolate:  Vitamin, folate supplement.


- **Mechanism of Action**: DHEA acts as a precursor to androgens and estrogens, potentially improving ovarian function and egg quality. L-methylfolate is essential for DNA synthesis, cell division, and red blood cell production, supporting healthy fetal development.


## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination, but the individual components have alternate names. DHEA is also known as prasterone. L-methylfolate is sometimes referred to as levomefolic acid, (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolate or (6S)-5-MTHF. 


- **Brand Names**: Various brand names exist for products containing this combination or similar combinations with added ingredients.  Brand names may vary by region and formulations. Some examples include Ovigyn D3, Coedhea Plus, and Dheagyn Plus. (Please note this list may not be exhaustive and may vary over time. Consult local drug formularies for specific product names available in the Indian market.)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: DHEA is a precursor hormone that can be converted into androgens and estrogens in the body. In women with diminished ovarian reserve, DHEA supplementation may increase androgen levels within the ovary, leading to improved follicle development and oocyte maturation. L-methylfolate is readily absorbed and converted to tetrahydrofolic acid, the active form of folate, crucial for DNA synthesis, cell division, and red blood cell formation.  This is particularly important during periods of rapid cell growth, such as pregnancy.


- **Pharmacokinetics**: DHEA is readily absorbed orally. It is metabolized in the liver and other tissues, primarily into androstenedione and androstenediol, and conjugated to sulfate and glucuronide forms.  L-methylfolate is well-absorbed orally, with peak levels in the blood within about 30-60 minutes.


- **Mode of Action:** DHEA modulates androgen and estrogen activity in the ovaries. L-methylfolate participates in one-carbon metabolism, donating a methyl group for various biochemical reactions essential for cell function.


- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition**: DHEA interacts with several steroid hormone receptors, primarily androgen and estrogen receptors.  It can also interact with other nuclear receptors like PPARÎ±.  L-methylfolate is involved in enzymatic reactions necessary for DNA synthesis and other metabolic processes.

- **Elimination**: DHEA and its metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine. L-methylfolate is primarily excreted in the urine.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults**:  Dosing varies depending on the formulation and indication. Consult a physician for dosage recommendations. As an example, a typical dosage regimen may involve 75 mg DHEA and 1 mg L-methylfolate once daily.

#### **Children**: This combination is not generally recommended for use in children.

#### **Special Cases**:

- **Elderly Patients**:  Careful consideration of age-related changes in hormone levels and organ function is necessary. Dose adjustments might be required.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment**:  Caution is advised. Dose adjustments might be required based on the degree of impairment.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**:  Caution is advised. Dose adjustments might be required based on the degree of impairment.
