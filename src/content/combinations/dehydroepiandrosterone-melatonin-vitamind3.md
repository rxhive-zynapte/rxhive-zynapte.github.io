## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as supportive therapy in the treatment of female infertility and male hypogonadism.  It may also be used to improve overall well-being and energy levels.  It is not FDA-approved for any specific indication and is typically marketed as a dietary supplement. This combination doesn't have a single pharmacological classification because it combines different classes of substances:

* **Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA):**  Endogenous steroid hormone, Hormone precursor.
* **Melatonin:** Antioxidant, Chronobiotic.
* **Vitamin D3:**  Fat-soluble vitamin.

DHEA acts as a precursor to sex hormones (estrogen and testosterone), which may help improve egg quality and ovarian function in women and testosterone levels in men. Melatonin improves sleep quality and has antioxidant properties. Vitamin D3 contributes to overall health, including bone health, which is important for reproductive health.

## **Alternate Names**

* DHEA + Melatonin + Vitamin D3
* Prasterone + Melatonin + Cholecalciferol
* Dehydroepiandrosterone/melatonin/vitamin D3

Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer.  Dhea Sure is one example of a brand name for this combination.


## **How It Works**

**Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA):**

* **Pharmacodynamics:**  DHEA is a precursor hormone that is converted into androgens and estrogens in the body. Its effects depend on the conversion into these hormones.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** DHEA is readily absorbed orally. It is metabolized in the liver and other tissues and excreted in the urine.
* **Mode of Action:** DHEA acts by being converted into active sex hormones. The precise mechanism related to infertility is not fully understood but is thought to involve improving ovarian function and egg quality.

**Melatonin:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle and has antioxidant properties.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Melatonin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine.
* **Mode of Action:** Melatonin binds to melatonin receptors in the brain, particularly MT1 and MT2 receptors, which are involved in regulating circadian rhythms.

**Vitamin D3:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:**  Vitamin D3 promotes calcium absorption and is important for bone health, immune function, and cell growth.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Vitamin D3 is absorbed from the gut and requires binding to vitamin D-binding protein for transport. It is metabolized in the liver and kidneys to its active form, calcitriol.
* **Mode of Action:** Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D3, binds to vitamin D receptors in various tissues, modulating gene expression and regulating calcium and phosphorus metabolism.


## **Dosage**

Dosage should be individualized based on patient needs and the specific product formulation.  **Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized dosage recommendations.** It is crucial to follow the instructions of the prescribed combination product carefully.  There is no standardized or FDA-approved dosage for this combination.

### **Standard Dosage**

It's important to note that because this product is a supplement and not an approved drug, there is no "standard dosage". What follows are typical dosages of the components, and may not be appropriate for combined therapy.

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage may need to be adjusted based on individual health status and organ function.  Lower dosages may be appropriate.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Careful monitoring and possible dosage adjustments are necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** DHEA is metabolized in the liver, so dosage modification may be required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions** (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease): Close monitoring and potential dose adjustments are needed.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination isn't typically used in hospital settings or emergency situations.
