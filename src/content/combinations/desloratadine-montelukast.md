## **Usage**

- Desloratadine + Montelukast is prescribed for the treatment of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and urticaria (hives).  It is also sometimes used for other allergic conditions.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination drug includes a second-generation antihistamine (Desloratadine) and a leukotriene receptor antagonist (Montelukast).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Desloratadine works by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction. Montelukast blocks the action of leukotrienes, another type of chemical involved in allergic and inflammatory responses. Together, they help to reduce the symptoms of allergies such as sneezing, runny nose, itching, and swelling.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate generic names exist for this combination. It is commonly referred to as Desloratadine + Montelukast or Desloratadine/Montelukast.
- **Brand Names:**  Brand names may vary regionally; some examples include Drescap-M, Desrotac-M.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Desloratadine selectively blocks peripheral histamine H1 receptors, thereby reducing the effects of histamine. Montelukast antagonizes leukotriene D4 receptors, inhibiting the actions of cysteinyl leukotrienes, which are potent bronchoconstrictors and pro-inflammatory mediators.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  
    - *Absorption:* Desloratadine is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentration in about 3 hours. Montelukast is also absorbed well, with peak levels occurring in 3 to 4 hours.
    - *Metabolism:* Both drugs are extensively metabolized in the liver. Desloratadine is primarily metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, while montelukast is mainly metabolized by CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9.
    - *Elimination:* Desloratadine is eliminated primarily through urine and feces, with a half-life of approximately 27 hours. Montelukast is also excreted mainly in feces, with a shorter half-life of 2.7 to 5.5 hours.

## **Dosage**

For younger children, age and weight-based dosing applies for both drugs. The combination is generally not recommended for children under 2.
