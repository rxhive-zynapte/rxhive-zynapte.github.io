## **Usage**

Desloratadine + Pseudoephedrine is prescribed for the relief of symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and the common cold, including nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, itchy or watery eyes, and itching of the nose or throat.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This drug is a combination product containing:

*   **Desloratadine:** A second-generation antihistamine (H1 receptor antagonist).
*   **Pseudoephedrine:** A sympathomimetic amine acting as a nasal decongestant (alpha-adrenergic agonist).

**Mechanism of Action:**

Desloratadine works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergic symptoms. Pseudoephedrine works by constricting blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.

## **Alternate Names**

Desloratadine/pseudoephedrine

**Brand Names:**

*   Clarinex-D 12 Hour
*   Clarinex-D 24 Hour
*   Aerius Dual Action


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Desloratadine selectively antagonizes peripheral histamine H1 receptors, reducing allergic symptoms. Pseudoephedrine activates alpha-adrenergic receptors in the nasal mucosa, causing vasoconstriction and reducing nasal congestion.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Both drugs are well-absorbed after oral administration.
*   **Metabolism:** Desloratadine is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Pseudoephedrine is partially metabolized in the liver.
*   **Elimination:** Desloratadine and its metabolites are primarily eliminated in urine and feces. Pseudoephedrine is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.

**Mode of Action:**  Desloratadine competitively binds to H1 receptors, preventing histamine from binding and triggering allergic reactions. Pseudoephedrine stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Desloratadine acts as an H1 receptor antagonist. Pseudoephedrine stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors.

**Elimination Pathways:** Desloratadine is eliminated through hepatic metabolism and renal/fecal excretion. Pseudoephedrine is primarily eliminated through renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults and Adolescents (12 years and older):**

*   **Clarinex-D 12 Hour:** One tablet (2.5 mg desloratadine/120 mg pseudoephedrine) every 12 hours.
*   **Clarinex-D 24 Hour:** One tablet (5 mg desloratadine/240 mg pseudoephedrine) once daily.

#### **Children (under 12 years):**

Use is not recommended due to the high pseudoephedrine content.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically required, but caution is advised due to potential age-related decline in organ function.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use is not recommended as pseudoephedrine can accumulate.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use is not recommended.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Desloratadine + Pseudoephedrine is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.  Its primary use is for outpatient management of allergic rhinitis and cold symptoms.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on age and renal/hepatic function.  The combination is generally avoided in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Dry mouth, headache, insomnia, fatigue, sore throat, nausea, dizziness, stomach upset, loss of appetite, constipation, flushing, restlessness, skin rash, itching, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (hives, difficulty breathing, swelling), severe dizziness, lightheadedness, tremors, irregular heartbeats, seizures.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic complications from prolonged use are rare.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Serious allergic reactions, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, CNS stimulation.


## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine, or loratadine.
*   Narrow-angle glaucoma.
*   Urinary retention.
*   Concurrent or recent (within 14 days) MAOI use.
*   Severe hypertension.
*   Severe coronary artery disease.

## **Drug Interactions**

*   MAOIs: Can cause a hypertensive crisis.
*   Other sympathomimetics (e.g., decongestants, stimulants):  Additive effects, increased risk of hypertension and other cardiovascular effects.
*   Beta-blockers: May reduce the effectiveness of pseudoephedrine or lead to hypertension.
*   Antihypertensives: May counteract the effects of pseudoephedrine.
*   Tricyclic antidepressants: Additive anticholinergic effects.
*   Alcohol: May increase the risk of drowsiness and other side effects.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy:**  Use only if clearly needed. Limited human data available.  Desloratadine has been assigned to Pregnancy Category C by the FDA, indicating potential fetal risk based on animal studies.

**Breastfeeding:** Not recommended. Both drugs are excreted in breast milk. Pseudoephedrine may decrease milk production and cause irritability in infants.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** Desloratadine: H1 receptor antagonist. Pseudoephedrine: Alpha-adrenergic agonist.
*   **Side Effects:** Dry mouth, headache, insomnia, dizziness, nausea.  Rarely: allergic reactions, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures.
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, MAOI use, severe hypertension/CAD.
*   **Drug Interactions:** MAOIs, sympathomimetics, beta-blockers, antihypertensives.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution in pregnancy if clearly needed. Not recommended while breastfeeding.
*   **Dosage:** Adults/adolescents:  Clarinex-D 12 Hour: 1 tablet every 12 hours; Clarinex-D 24 Hour: 1 tablet daily. Not for use in children <12 years.
