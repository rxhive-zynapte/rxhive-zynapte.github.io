## **Usage**

Dexamethasone + Gatifloxacin is prescribed for bacterial eye infections and inflammatory ocular conditions. It is particularly useful after eye surgeries (e.g., cataract surgery) to prevent and treat infections and control inflammation. Secondary uses include managing blepharitis, scleritis, episcleritis, iritis, cyclitis, iridocyclitis, choroiditis, optic neuritis, chronic anterior uveitis, disciform and interstitial keratitis, allergic corneal marginal ulcers, and corneal injuries from chemical, radiation, or thermal burns.

Its pharmacological classifications are:

* **Corticosteroid:** Dexamethasone
* **Fluoroquinolone Antibiotic:** Gatifloxacin

**Mechanism of Action:** Dexamethasone reduces inflammation by inhibiting prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Gatifloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, essential enzymes for bacterial DNA replication and cell division, resulting in bacterial cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for the combination. However, numerous brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region. Some examples include Gatilox DM, Gflotas D, Gatia-D, Gatiblu-D, Gate Dm Bak Free, Engatt D, Audiget D, Getoli D, and Meris-D.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Dexamethasone, a potent corticosteroid, binds to glucocorticoid receptors, suppressing inflammation by inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators (prostaglandins, leukotrienes). Gatifloxacin, a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, disrupting bacterial DNA replication and leading to cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  The combination is administered topically as eye drops or ointment.  Systemic absorption is minimal. Gatifloxacin's primary elimination route is renal, while dexamethasone is metabolized in the liver.  Specific pharmacokinetic parameters for topical ocular administration are not readily available.

**Mode of Action:** Dexamethasone exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by binding to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors, modulating gene expression, and inhibiting inflammatory pathways. Gatifloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for DNA supercoiling and decatenation. This inhibition disrupts bacterial DNA replication, transcription, and repair, leading to cell death.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Instill 1-2 drops into the affected eye(s) every 2 hours while awake (up to 8 times/day) on days 1 and 2. Reduce to 1 drop 2 to 4 times/day on days 3 through 7.

#### **Children:**  For children aged 1 year and older, follow the adult dosing guidelines.  Safety and efficacy in children younger than 1 year have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically required based on age alone.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** For systemic gatifloxacin, dose adjustment is required, but not for topical ophthalmic use.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  For systemic gatifloxacin, no dose adjustment is necessary. Topical ophthalmic use is unlikely to require adjustments.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in clinical settings generally adheres to the standard adult dosage. Duration of treatment may vary based on the specific condition and clinical response.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

For topical ophthalmic use, dose adjustments are not routinely needed based on renal or hepatic function. Prolonged use (more than 10 days) requires monitoring of intraocular pressure.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Eye irritation, burning, stinging
* Blurred vision
* Tearing
* Eye pain, redness, itching
* Foreign body sensation
* Unpleasant taste (especially with eye drops)
* Headache

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (e.g., rash, hives, swelling)
* Corneal ulceration or perforation
* Vision changes
* Increased intraocular pressure (IOP)
* Secondary infections (fungal or viral)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

* Cataract formation (with prolonged use)
* Glaucoma (with prolonged use)


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to gatifloxacin, dexamethasone, or any component of the formulation.
* Viral infections of the cornea or conjunctiva (e.g., herpes simplex, varicella).
* Fungal infections of the eye.
* Mycobacterial infections of the eye.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Other Quinolones:** Concurrent use of other quinolone antibiotics (systemic) may increase the risk of side effects.
* **Drugs Affecting QT Interval:**  Systemic gatifloxacin can prolong the QT interval and should be used cautiously with other drugs that also prolong the QT interval.
* **CYP450 Interactions:** Systemic gatifloxacin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4.  Concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers may affect gatifloxacin levels. For topical use, drug interactions are less of a concern due to minimal systemic absorption.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Use only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:** Use with caution as it is unknown if the drug is excreted in breast milk.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Dexamethasone: Inhibits inflammation; Gatifloxacin: Inhibits bacterial DNA replication
* **Side Effects:** Eye irritation, blurred vision, increased IOP, secondary infections
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, viral/fungal/mycobacterial eye infections
* **Drug Interactions:** Other quinolones (systemic), QT-prolonging drugs (systemic)
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution
* **Dosage:** 1-2 drops every 2 hours initially, then 2-4 times/day
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Intraocular pressure (with prolonged use)


## **Popular Combinations**

This combination itself is a popular fixed-dose combination for ocular use. There are no commonly recommended additional medications combined with this specific formulation.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:**  Monitor for signs of hypersensitivity or secondary infection.  Prolonged use necessitates IOP monitoring.
* **Specific Populations:** Pregnant and breastfeeding women should use cautiously. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children under 1 year of age.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Blurred vision may temporarily impair driving ability.
