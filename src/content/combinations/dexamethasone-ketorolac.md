## **Usage**

Dexamethasone + Ketorolac combination is prescribed for short-term management of moderate to severe pain, particularly post-operative pain, where both anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects are desired.  It is also prescribed for acute renal colic. It is not for chronic or minor pain.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Dexamethasone: Corticosteroid, Anti-inflammatory
* Ketorolac: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), Analgesic

**Mechanism of Action:**

Dexamethasone reduces inflammation by inhibiting inflammatory mediators. Ketorolac inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, reducing pain and inflammation. The combination provides synergistic pain relief and reduces inflammation.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no official alternate name for the combination, however the drugs are often referred together as "Decadron and Toradol" due to popular brand names.

**Brand Names:**

There are no combined brand names for this drug combination, each medication is available under individual brand names.
* Dexamethasone: Decadron, Dexamethasone Intensol, Dexpak and others.
* Ketorolac: Toradol

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Dexamethasone exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors, modulating gene expression, and suppressing inflammatory pathways.  Ketorolac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, thereby decreasing pain and inflammation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Dexamethasone:** Well-absorbed orally, IM, and IV. Metabolized in the liver and excreted renally. Long half-life (36-54 hours).
* **Ketorolac:**  Well-absorbed orally, IM, and IV.  Peak plasma concentration occurs in about 1 hour (IM) or 30 minutes (IV).  Highly protein-bound. Metabolized in the liver to inactive metabolites and excreted primarily in the urine. Short half-life (2.5-9 hours).

**Mode of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Dexamethasone binds to glucocorticoid receptors, influencing gene transcription. Ketorolac inhibits COX enzymes non-selectively.

**Elimination Pathways:** Both are primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism followed by renal excretion.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Weight â‰¥ 50 kg:**
    * IM/IV:  Initial dose 30 mg IV/IM followed by 15 to 30 mg IV or IM every 6 hours; maximum daily dose: 120 mg for up to 5 days.

    * IM/IV: Initial dose 15 mg IV/IM followed by 15 mg IV/IM every 6 hours; maximum daily dose: 60 mg for up to 5 days.
    * Oral: 10 mg once after IV/IM therapy, then 10 mg every 4-6 hours; maximum daily dose 40mg for up to 5 days total.

#### **Children:**

* **1 month to <2 years:** 0.5 mg/kg IV every 6-8 hours.
* **2 to 16 years:** Single dose: 1 mg/kg IM (max 30 mg) or 0.5 mg/kg IV (max 15 mg). Multiple dose: 0.5 mg/kg IM/IV every 6 hours (max 15 mg/dose) for up to 5 days.
* For moderately severe acute pain (off-label): Single dose: 0.5 mg/kg IV/IM once (not to exceed 15 mg). Multiple dose: 0.5 mg/kg IV/IM every 6 hours (not to exceed 5 days).

Pediatric safety: Use with caution; monitor for gastrointestinal and renal adverse effects. Total duration of therapy should not exceed 5 days.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Reduced doses are recommended due to decreased renal and hepatic function. Start with the lowest dose and titrate as needed. Maximum dose should not exceed 60 mg/day IM/IV or 40 mg/day oral.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    * Moderate: 50% of the recommended dose; not to exceed 60 mg/day IM/IV.
    * Severe: Contraindicated.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution and at reduced doses.  Monitor closely for adverse effects.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or other relevant conditions. Adjust dose as needed.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing is generally as outlined above. Duration of therapy should not exceed 5 days.

* **Intubation:** Premedication with Dexamethasone might reduce incidence of postoperative sore throat.
* **Surgical Procedures:** Commonly used for post-operative pain management.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:**  Use with caution, especially in patients at increased risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Careful monitoring is required due to the potential for renal and gastrointestinal complications.
* **Emergency Situations:** Ketorolac may be used for short-term pain control in emergencies.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**  Adjustments are necessary based on renal function, hepatic function, age, weight, and comorbidities.  Consult package insert or clinical guidelines for specific adjustments.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, dyspepsia, diarrhea, constipation)
