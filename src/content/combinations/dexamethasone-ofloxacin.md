## **Usage**

Dexamethasone + Ofloxacin is primarily prescribed for bacterial infections of the eye and ear, particularly where inflammation is a significant component.  It is also used for certain other bacterial infections accompanied by inflammation.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Dexamethasone: Corticosteroid, anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressant
* Ofloxacin: Fluoroquinolone antibiotic

**Mechanism of Action:** Dexamethasone reduces inflammation by binding to glucocorticoid receptors, inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators. Ofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair, leading to bacterial cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no single international nonproprietary name (INN) for this combination. The individual components are recognized as dexamethasone and ofloxacin. It's marketed under various brand names like Oxop-D, Ciflox-D, and others.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Dexamethasone exerts its anti-inflammatory action by binding to glucocorticoid receptors, which leads to decreased production of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes.  Ofloxacin exerts its bactericidal action by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  

* **Dexamethasone:** Administered topically as eye/ear drops. Systemic absorption is minimal. Metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted in the urine.
* **Ofloxacin:** When administered as eye/ear drops, systemic absorption is low. When administered orally, it is well-absorbed, metabolized in the liver, and excreted primarily in the urine.

**Mode of Action:** Dexamethasone binds to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors, modulating gene expression and reducing inflammatory responses. Ofloxacin inhibits bacterial topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV.

**Elimination Pathways:** Both drugs are primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  For eye infections, 1-2 drops in the affected eye every 2-4 hours initially, then reduced to four times a day.  For ear infections,  4 drops in the affected ear twice daily.  The treatment duration typically does not exceed 10 days.

#### **Children:**  Pediatric dosage must be determined by a physician. For ear infections in children (1 to 12 years of age) with tympanostomy tubes, 5 drops in the affected ear twice a day for ten days. For children 6 months and older, 4 drops in the affected ear twice daily for seven days.

#### **Special Cases:**  

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment is required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised in patients with diabetes, glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, or a history of seizures.  Blood glucose monitoring is recommended in diabetic patients.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in these settings is determined by the specific infection and patient factors. Consult specialized guidelines.

* **Intubation:** Not typically used.
* **Surgical Procedures:**  May be used post-operatively to prevent inflammation and infection in ophthalmic procedures.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not typically used.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Use with caution and monitor for potential adverse effects.
* **Emergency Situations:** Not typically used.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modification is based on renal/hepatic function, age, and concomitant medications.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Eye: Discomfort, irritation, burning/stinging, dryness, redness, itching, blurred vision.

Ear: Discomfort, itching.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), tendon rupture (especially with concomitant systemic corticosteroid use),  increased intraocular pressure, central nervous system effects (seizures, dizziness, headache), peripheral neuropathy.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Prolonged topical corticosteroid use can lead to glaucoma, cataracts, and secondary ocular infections.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Hypersensitivity reactions,  tendon rupture, QT prolongation (with systemic ofloxacin).


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to fluoroquinolones or corticosteroids, viral infections of the eye or ear (including herpes simplex keratitis), fungal infections of the eye or ear, myasthenia gravis.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **CYP450 Interactions:**  Ofloxacin is a moderate inhibitor of CYP1A2.
* **Other Drug Interactions:** Concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids increases the risk of tendon rupture. Antacids, multivitamins containing divalent cations (iron, zinc, calcium), and warfarin may interact with ofloxacin. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase the risk of CNS side effects with ofloxacin.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:** Consult a physician before use. Ofloxacin is present in breast milk.  The safety of topical dexamethasone during breastfeeding is unknown.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Dexamethasone: Inhibits inflammation. Ofloxacin: Inhibits bacterial DNA synthesis.
* **Side Effects:** Eye/ear irritation, allergic reactions, tendon rupture (rare).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, viral/fungal infections of the eye/ear.
* **Drug Interactions:** Systemic corticosteroids (increased tendon rupture risk), antacids, multivitamins, warfarin, NSAIDs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
* **Dosage:** Eye: 1-2 drops several times daily; Ear: 4 drops twice daily (adults). Adjustments required for children and specific conditions.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Intraocular pressure (with long-term use), blood glucose (in diabetics), signs of tendonitis.

## **Popular Combinations**

It is not typically combined with other drugs in the same formulation.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:**  Assess for allergies, pre-existing eye/ear conditions, and concurrent medications.
* **Specific Populations:** Monitor pregnant/breastfeeding women, children, and the elderly closely.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Avoid excessive sun exposure.  Blurred vision may impair driving ability.
