## **Usage**

- Dexchlorpheniramine + Phenylpropanolamine is prescribed for the temporary relief of symptoms associated with the common cold, allergies, and sinusitis, such as runny nose, sneezing, itchy and watery eyes, and nasal congestion.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination medication includes a first-generation antihistamine (dexchlorpheniramine) and a decongestant (phenylpropanolamine).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dexchlorpheniramine blocks the action of histamine, reducing allergic symptoms. Phenylpropanolamine constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving congestion.

## **Alternate Names**

- While the generic name is Dexchlorpheniramine + Phenylpropanolamine, specific brand names can vary regionally. Some examples might include formulations containing these ingredients under different product names (e.g., containing variations with chlorpheniramine maleate instead of dexchlorpheniramine). Due to safety concerns related to phenylpropanolamine, this exact combination might not be readily available in some regions.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dexchlorpheniramine acts as an inverse agonist at the H1 histamine receptor, reducing the effects of histamine release. Phenylpropanolamine acts as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, constricting blood vessels in the nasal mucosa.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Both drugs are absorbed orally. Dexchlorpheniramine is metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6 enzymes, and has a half-life of 20-30 hours. Phenylpropanolamine is also metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine.
- **Mode of Action:** Dexchlorpheniramine competes with histamine for H1 receptor sites, thereby reducing the effects of histamine on blood vessels, smooth muscle, and glands. Phenylpropanolamine stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Dexchlorpheniramine is primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism with subsequent urinary excretion of metabolites. Phenylpropanolamine is predominantly excreted in the urine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Dexchlorpheniramine: 2 mg every 4-6 hours.
- Phenylpropanolamine: 12.5-25 mg every 4-6 hours (not to exceed 150mg/day).  Note: Formulations containing phenylpropanolamine may not be available in all regions due to safety concerns. 

#### **Children:**

- Dosing varies based on age and weight. Consult a pediatrician or refer to specific product labeling for pediatric dosing guidelines.
- Pediatric Safety Considerations: Use with caution in young children as they may be more susceptible to side effects such as excitement, nervousness, and irritability.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and monitor closely for adverse effects like dizziness, confusion, and urinary retention.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary due to altered metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution should be exercised in patients with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, and prostatic hyperplasia.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Due to potential safety concerns, this combination is generally not recommended for use in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, intensive care units, or emergency situations. Other medications are generally preferred for these specific scenarios.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be needed based on renal or hepatic impairment, age, and other concomitant medications. Consider therapeutic drug monitoring where appropriate.

## **Side Effects**

- Cardiovascular events (e.g., increased heart rate, palpitations, hypertension)
- Seizures
- Difficulty urinating

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic use of phenylpropanolamine has been associated with a potential increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke, though this is rare.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, significant cardiovascular events, and neurological symptoms require immediate medical attention.
