## **Usage**

Dexketoprofen + Paracetamol is prescribed for the short-term symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe acute pain, such as postoperative pain,  musculoskeletal pain (including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis), dysmenorrhea (painful periods), dental pain, and other conditions requiring potent analgesic effects.  It is also effective in reducing fever.

It is classified pharmacologically as an analgesic and antipyretic combination.

The mechanism of action involves two components: Dexketoprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, which are mediators of pain and inflammation.  Paracetamol (acetaminophen) acts centrally, likely inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis in the central nervous system and modulating the hypothalamic heat-regulating center.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no single official alternate name for this specific combination drug. However, the individual components are known by various names:

* **Dexketoprofen:**  Dexketoprofen trometamol
* **Paracetamol:** Acetaminophen (primarily used in the United States and Canada)

Brand names vary depending on the region and manufacturer. Some popular brand names include Aseket and Infuen-P. Ketesse is a brand name for Dexketoprofen.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Dexketoprofen exerts its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects peripherally by inhibiting COX enzymes and reducing prostaglandin synthesis.  Paracetamol's central action contributes to pain relief by elevating the pain threshold and reduces fever through its action on the hypothalamic heat-regulating center.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Both drugs are well-absorbed orally.  Food may delay the absorption of Dexketoprofen but does not significantly affect its bioavailability.  Both drugs are extensively metabolized in the liver. Dexketoprofen is mainly conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted in the urine. Paracetamol is metabolized via glucuronidation, sulfation, and a minor pathway involving CYP2E1, with metabolites excreted in the urine.  

**Mode of Action:**  Dexketoprofen inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, preventing the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins.  Paracetamol's precise mechanism is not fully elucidated but involves central inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and possible modulation of endocannabinoid and serotonergic pathways.

**Elimination:** Dexketoprofen is primarily eliminated renally. Paracetamol is predominantly eliminated renally after hepatic metabolism.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  The recommended oral dose is generally 12.5 mg of Dexketoprofen + 325 to 500 mg Paracetamol every 4-6 hours, or 25 mg of Dexketoprofen + 500 mg Paracetamol every 8 hours.  The total daily dose of Dexketoprofen should not exceed 75 mg, and the total daily dose of Paracetamol should not exceed 4000 mg (4g) per day.

#### **Children:**  This combination is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age as safety and efficacy have not been established. 

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose (50 mg total daily dose of Dexketoprofen) and increase only if well-tolerated.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Reduce the dose based on creatinine clearance.  For mild impairment (CrCl 60-89 ml/min), start with 50 mg total daily dose of Dexketoprofen.  Contraindicated in moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCl < 60 ml/min).
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Reduce the initial dose to 50 mg daily dose of Dexketoprofen for mild to moderate impairment. Contraindicated in severe hepatic dysfunction.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with a history of gastrointestinal ulcers, bleeding, inflammatory bowel disease, severe heart failure, asthma triggered by NSAIDs, or other relevant comorbidities.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical use cases (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations) generally follow the standard adult dosing adjusted for renal or hepatic impairment as necessary. For IV administration, the usual dose is 50 mg of Dexketoprofen every 8-12 hours, administered slowly over at least 15 seconds. The maximum IV dose is 150 mg daily. Dexketoprofen + paracetamol can be combined with opioids if pain is not controlled by the combination alone.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dose adjustments are necessary for patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, as specified above.  Consider also adjusting the dose for patients with other conditions affecting drug metabolism or clearance.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, drowsiness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation,  myocardial infarction, stroke, severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), hepatotoxicity, acute renal failure.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic use of NSAIDs can increase the risk of cardiovascular and renal complications. Long term use of Paracetamol at high doses can lead to hepatotoxicity.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any severe or unexpected reaction should be considered a potential ADR and reported appropriately.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to dexketoprofen, paracetamol, or any NSAIDs.
* History of asthma, bronchospasm, or allergic-type reactions after taking NSAIDs.
* Active peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Severe heart failure.
* Severe renal or hepatic impairment.
* Third trimester of pregnancy.

## **Drug Interactions**

* Other NSAIDs (increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects)
* Anticoagulants (increased risk of bleeding)
* Diuretics and ACE inhibitors (reduced antihypertensive effect)
* Lithium (increased lithium levels)
* Methotrexate (increased methotrexate toxicity)
* CYP2E1 inducers (e.g., rifampicin) (increased risk of paracetamol hepatotoxicity).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Dexketoprofen + Paracetamol is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy. Its use is not recommended during the first and second trimesters unless clearly necessary. Consult with a healthcare professional if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is being considered. Excretion in breast milk is minimal and considered low risk.
