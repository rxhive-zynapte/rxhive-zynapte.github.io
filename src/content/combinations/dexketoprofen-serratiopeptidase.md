## **Usage**

Dexketoprofen + Serratiopeptidase is prescribed for short-term management of moderate to severe pain and inflammation. This includes musculoskeletal pain, post-operative pain, dental pain, and dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation).  It is also used to reduce swelling and inflammation following injuries or surgical procedures.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Dexketoprofen: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
* Serratiopeptidase: Proteolytic enzyme

**Mechanism of Action:** Dexketoprofen inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis which decreases pain and inflammation. Serratiopeptidase breaks down proteins like bradykinin and fibrin, further reducing inflammation and promoting tissue repair.

## **Alternate Names** 

Dexketoprofen is also known as Ketesse, Enantyum, and Dexofen. There are no widely recognized alternate names for Serratiopeptidase.

**Brand Names:** Veldix XT is a known brand name for the combination of Dexketoprofen and Serratiopeptidase.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Dexketoprofen primarily reduces pain and inflammation through COX inhibition.  Serratiopeptidase's proteolytic action further diminishes inflammation by breaking down inflammatory mediators and facilitating tissue repair.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Dexketoprofen:**  Rapidly absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentration in about 30 minutes on an empty stomach.  Metabolized primarily in the liver via glucuronidation and excreted mainly through the kidneys.
* **Serratiopeptidase:** Absorbed in the intestines and enters the bloodstream, reaching its site of action. Its metabolism and elimination pathways are not fully characterized.

**Mode of Action:** Dexketoprofen inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis. Serratiopeptidase breaks down proteins that contribute to inflammation.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Dexketoprofen primarily acts through COX enzyme inhibition.  Serratiopeptidase exerts its effect through proteolytic activity.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Dexketoprofen is eliminated mainly through renal excretion, with some hepatic metabolism via CYP enzymes. The elimination pathways of serratiopeptidase are not fully defined.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Dexketoprofen: 25 mg every 8 hours, not to exceed 75 mg daily. Serratiopeptidase: 10 mg three times a day (maximum 60 mg/day). Administer 2 hours after meals.

#### **Children:** This combination is not recommended for use in children due to limited safety and efficacy data.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Initiate dexketoprofen at the lower end of the dosing range (50 mg total daily dose) due to potential age-related decline in renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** For mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60–89 mL/min), reduce the initial dexketoprofen dose to 50 mg total daily. Contraindicated in moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤59 mL/min).
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** For mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 5–9), reduce the dexketoprofen dose to 50 mg total daily. Closely monitor liver function. Contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with hypertension, cardiac conditions, or a history of gastrointestinal diseases.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of Dexketoprofen + Serratiopeptidase in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations is not well-established and generally not recommended.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are necessary based on renal or hepatic dysfunction, as described above. Consult a specialist for dosage adjustments in cases of metabolic disorders or genetic polymorphisms impacting drug metabolism.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, and skin rash are the most common side effects.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcers, severe allergic reactions (angioedema, anaphylaxis), and Stevens-Johnson syndrome can occur rarely.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic kidney disease, gastrointestinal issues, and cardiovascular complications can potentially arise with long-term NSAID use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), anaphylaxis, and significant gastrointestinal bleeding are some serious ADRs requiring immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to dexketoprofen, serratiopeptidase, or any other NSAID.
* History of asthma, urticaria, or rhinitis precipitated by NSAIDs or aspirin.
* Active peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Severe heart failure, hepatic impairment, or renal impairment.
* Third trimester of pregnancy and breastfeeding.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Other NSAIDs:** Increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects.
* **Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin):** Enhanced anticoagulant effect, increasing bleeding risk.
* **Lithium, Methotrexate, Digoxin:** Elevated serum levels of these drugs.
* **Diuretics and Antihypertensives:** Reduced effectiveness of these medications.
* **Alcohol:** Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and liver damage.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Contraindicated in the third trimester of pregnancy and not recommended during breastfeeding.  Use in the first and second trimesters only if clearly necessary and under strict medical supervision.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Dexketoprofen inhibits COX enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis. Serratiopeptidase breaks down inflammatory mediators.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal distress, dizziness, headache, skin rash, and potentially serious effects like gastrointestinal bleeding and allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, asthma/urticaria/rhinitis precipitated by NSAIDs, active peptic ulcer/GI bleeding, severe heart/liver/kidney disease, third-trimester pregnancy, breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** Other NSAIDs, anticoagulants, lithium, methotrexate, digoxin, diuretics, and antihypertensives.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in the third trimester, not recommended during breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** Adults: Dexketoprofen 25mg every 8 hours (max 75mg/day); Serratiopeptidase 10mg TID (max 60mg/day). Adjustments for elderly, renal/hepatic impairment.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver and renal function, blood pressure, complete blood count (CBC), signs of gastrointestinal bleeding.


## **Popular Combinations**

While dexketoprofen is sometimes combined with paracetamol for enhanced analgesic effect, combining it with serratiopeptidase is less common.


## **Precautions**

* Pre-screening for allergies, metabolic disorders, and organ dysfunction is essential.
* Caution is advised in pregnant women (especially in the third trimester), breastfeeding mothers, children, elderly patients, and those with renal or hepatic impairment.
* Avoid alcohol and activities requiring alertness. Monitor for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding.
