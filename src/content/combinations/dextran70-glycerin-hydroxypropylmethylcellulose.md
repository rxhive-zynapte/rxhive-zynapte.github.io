## **Usage**

- This combination is prescribed for the temporary relief of burning, irritation, and discomfort due to dryness of the eye. This dryness can be caused by various factors such as exposure to wind or sun, reduced tear production, or increased tear evaporation.  It is also used as a protectant against further irritation.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Ophthalmic lubricant, demulcent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** The combination works by mimicking natural tears and lubricating the ocular surface. Dextran 70 and Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose are demulcents, providing a soothing and protective coating over the cornea. Glycerin acts as a humectant, drawing water to the ocular surface to maintain moisture.

## **Alternate Names**

- Hypromellose + Glycerin + Dextran, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose + Glycerin + Dextran 70 Ophthalmic Solution.
- **Brand Names:** Tears Naturale Forte, Ara Eye Drops, Gentle Tears, Celsus, and various generic formulations.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The primary effect is to lubricate and protect the ocular surface, reducing dryness, irritation, and discomfort.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily topical action; minimal systemic absorption.
- **Mode of Action:** Dextran 70 and Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose increase the viscosity of the tear film and form a protective layer on the ocular surface, preventing evaporation and providing lubrication. Glycerin attracts and retains moisture on the eye's surface. There is no specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation involved.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Due to minimal systemic absorption, elimination pathways are not clinically significant.  Excess solution is typically blinked away or wiped off.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Instill 1 or 2 drops in the affected eye(s) as needed or as directed by the physician.
