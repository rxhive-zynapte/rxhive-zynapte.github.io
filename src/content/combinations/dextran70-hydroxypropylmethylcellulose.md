      What is the recommended dosage for Dextran 70 +
      Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose?**


      **A:** The recommended dosage is 1 or 2 drops in the affected eye(s) as
      needed, up to every 1-2 hours, or as directed by a physician. This applies
      to adults and children.

      Can I use this with contact lenses?**


      **A:** Remove contact lenses before instilling the drops. Wait at least 15
      minutes after use before reinserting lenses. Benzalkonium chloride, a
      common preservative, can be absorbed by and discolor soft lenses.

      **A:** Systemic absorption is negligible after topical ocular
      administration, meaning very little of the medication enters the
      bloodstream. It primarily acts locally on the surface of the eye.

## **Usage**

- Dextran 70 + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose is prescribed for the temporary relief of burning, irritation, and discomfort due to dryness of the eye. It can also be used as a protectant against further irritation and for the temporary relief of discomfort due to minor irritations of the eye or exposure to wind or sun.  It is also used for rewetting all types of contact lenses (rigid gas permeable, soft, daily, extended wear, and disposable) to relieve discomfort, minor irritation, or blurring.
- **Pharmacological classification:**  Ophthalmic lubricant, demulcent, artificial tears.
- **Mechanism of action:** This combination acts as a tear substitute. Dextran 70 and Hypromellose are both lubricants that increase the viscosity of the tear film, providing a soothing and protective coating on the ocular surface, thus relieving dryness and irritation.

## **Alternate Names**

- Dextran 70 and Hypromellose,  DUASORB™
- **Brand names:** Tears Naturale, Poly-Tears, Bion Tears, CVS Gentle Tears, Duratears.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dextran 70 and Hypromellose are pharmacologically inert, meaning they do not have a direct pharmacological effect on the body. They act physically by lubricating and moisturizing the ocular surface.  They increase tear film viscosity, prolong tear film break-up time, and provide a smooth, wettable surface for the cornea.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Topical ocular administration results in negligible systemic absorption.  Both components primarily exert their effects locally on the ocular surface. Elimination pathways are not clinically significant due to the minimal absorption. There is no information available regarding metabolism by CYP enzymes.
- **Mode of action:** Dextran 70 and Hypromellose physically form a lubricating, transparent, and moistening film over the cornea.  This artificial tear film supplements the natural tear film, reducing surface tension and providing temporary relief from dryness and irritation. There is no receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation involved.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
Instill 1 or 2 drops in the affected eye(s) as needed, up to once every 1-2 hours, or as directed by a physician.

#### **Children:**
The same dosage as adults applies to children. No dosage adjustments are necessary.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustments are needed.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustments are needed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustments are needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific dosage adjustments are generally required, but consider individual patient needs.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosage for all listed clinical use cases is the standard dosage: instill 1 or 2 drops in the affected eye(s) as needed or as directed.
- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations**


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Generally, no dosage adjustments are necessary based on renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
- Temporary blurred vision
- Minor burning or stinging upon instillation

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Eye pain
- Changes in vision
- Continued eye redness/irritation lasting more than 72 hours

### **Long-Term Effects**
No long-term adverse effects have been reported.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
- Allergic reactions (rare): rash, itching/swelling (especially of the face/tongue/throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing


## **Contraindications**
- Hypersensitivity to Dextran 70, Hypromellose, or any of the excipients (e.g., benzalkonium chloride).



## **Drug Interactions**
- If using more than one topical ophthalmic product, wait at least 5 minutes between administrations.
- Eye ointments should be administered last.
- Benzalkonium chloride can be absorbed by soft contact lenses and discolor them. Remove contact lenses before application and wait at least 15 minutes before reinsertion.
-  Clinically relevant drug interactions are not expected due to the minimal systemic absorption of Dextran 70 and Hypromellose.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** No specific FDA pregnancy risk category rating assigned. No adverse effects during pregnancy are anticipated due to negligible systemic absorption. Safe for use during pregnancy.

- **Breastfeeding:** Safe for use during breastfeeding. No adverse effects on the breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated. Excretion in breast milk is unknown but not considered clinically significant.



## **Drug Profile Summary**
- **Mechanism of Action:** Lubricates and moisturizes the ocular surface, supplementing the natural tear film.

- **Side Effects:** Temporary blurred vision, minor burning or stinging. Rarely, eye pain, vision changes, continued redness/irritation, or allergic reactions.

- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to any component.

- **Drug Interactions:**  Administer other ophthalmic medications 5 minutes apart; remove contact lenses before use; ointments last.

- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

- **Dosage:** 1-2 drops in the affected eye(s) as needed, up to once every 1-2 hours, or as directed.


- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for persistent eye irritation, pain, vision changes, or signs of allergic reaction.


## **Popular Combinations**
Often used alone. No common drug combinations are specifically recommended.



## **Precautions**
- **General Precautions:** Do not use if the solution changes color or becomes cloudy. Do not touch the dropper tip to any surface. Discard single-use vials after opening.
