      Diphenhydramine + Phenylpropanolamine?**


      **A:** It varies based on the formulation. Consult the product's labeling
      for specific instructions. Typically for adults, the doses range from
      10-30mg for dextromethorphan, 12.5-50mg for diphenhydramine, and 5-15mg
      for phenylpropanolamine every 4-6 hours. Doses are typically lower for

      Is this drug addictive?**


      **A:** While the components alone do not pose an addictive risk at the
      recommended doses, DXM abuse can be encountered and is often accompanied
      by concomitant abuse of other agents, leading to physiological and
      psychological issues including dependence, overdose, acute psychosis and
      fatal serotonin syndrome.

## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the temporary relief of symptoms associated with the common cold or allergies, including cough, nasal congestion, and runny nose.  It is also used to treat symptoms of the flu such as cough, fever, headache, aches, and sore throat.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antitussive (dextromethorphan), antihistamine (diphenhydramine), and decongestant (phenylpropanolamine).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dextromethorphan suppresses cough by acting on the cough center in the brain. Diphenhydramine reduces allergic symptoms by blocking histamine receptors. Phenylpropanolamine relieves nasal congestion by constricting blood vessels in the nasal passages.

## **Alternate Names**

This specific combination does not have a widely recognized international nonproprietary name (INN). The components, however, are known by their respective INNs. It is marketed regionally under various brand names, some of which include Bromfed-DM, Dimetane DX, and Robitussin Cough and Allergy.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dextromethorphan acts centrally on the cough center in the medulla to suppress the cough reflex.  Diphenhydramine acts peripherally by blocking the H1 histamine receptors, reducing allergy symptoms like sneezing and runny nose. Phenylpropanolamine, a sympathomimetic amine, acts as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, causing vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa, which reduces nasal congestion.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** All three components are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
    - **Metabolism:** Dextromethorphan is primarily metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, specifically CYP2D6. Diphenhydramine is also metabolized in the liver. Phenylpropanolamine is partially metabolized in the liver and partially excreted unchanged in the urine.
    - **Elimination:** Dextromethorphan and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Diphenhydramine is excreted in the urine, primarily as metabolites. Phenylpropanolamine is excreted in the urine, both as unchanged drug and metabolites.

- **Mode of Action:** Dextromethorphan's antitussive effect is thought to involve sigma-1 receptor agonism and antagonism of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Diphenhydramine competes with histamine for H1 receptor sites. Phenylpropanolamine stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors in the nasal mucosa, leading to vasoconstriction and reduced congestion.

- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** As described earlier, dextromethorphan is a sigma-1 receptor agonist and nicotinic receptor antagonist; diphenhydramine is an H1 receptor antagonist; phenylpropanolamine is an alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist.  

- **Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily renal excretion for all three drugs, after varying degrees of hepatic metabolism. Dextromethorphan is metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The standard dose for adults varies by product formulation and is typically 10-20mg of dextromethorphan, 12.5-25mg of diphenhydramine, and 10-15mg of phenylpropanolamine every 4-6 hours.

#### **Children:**  Dosing in children is weight and age-dependent and should be carefully determined based on product-specific recommendations.  Use in children under 2 years of age is generally not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Lower doses may be needed due to decreased clearance.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be necessary. 
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment is often required.
