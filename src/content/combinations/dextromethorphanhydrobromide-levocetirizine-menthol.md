## **Usage**

- This combination medication is used for the temporary relief of symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, and allergies, including cough, runny nose, sneezing, itchy eyes, and sore throat.  It provides symptomatic relief from cough and cold symptoms, especially when allergies are also present.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antitussive (Dextromethorphan), Antihistamine (Levocetirizine), Topical Anesthetic/Counterirritant (Menthol)
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Dextromethorphan suppresses the cough reflex by acting on the cough center in the medulla oblongata. Levocetirizine, a second-generation antihistamine, blocks histamine H1 receptors, thus reducing allergic symptoms. Menthol provides a cooling sensation and acts as a mild topical anesthetic, soothing throat irritation.

## **Alternate Names**

- Dextromethorphan-Levocetirizine-Menthol
- Levocetirizine-Dextromethorphan-Menthol
- Several brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region. A few examples include CGX-Tus Syrup, Nilcold-DM Syrup, and Nodorex-DX Syrup.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dextromethorphan acts centrally to suppress the cough reflex.  Levocetirizine antagonizes peripheral histamine H1 receptors, mitigating allergic symptoms. Menthol acts as a local anesthetic and counterirritant.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Dextromethorphan and levocetirizine are well-absorbed orally. Menthol is absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes.
    - **Metabolism:** Dextromethorphan is metabolized in the liver. Levocetirizine undergoes minimal first-pass metabolism. Menthol is metabolized in the liver.
    - **Elimination:** Dextromethorphan metabolites are primarily excreted in urine. Levocetirizine is mainly excreted unchanged in urine. Menthol is excreted in urine and bile.
- **Mode of Action:** Dextromethorphan acts on the cough center in the medulla. Levocetirizine competitively binds to peripheral H1 receptors. Menthol activates TRPM8 receptors, leading to a cooling sensation.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Levocetirizine competitively inhibits histamine binding to H1 receptors.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Dextromethorphan: 10-20 mg every 4 hours, or 30 mg every 6-8 hours, not exceeding 120 mg/day.
- Levocetirizine: 5 mg once daily.
- Menthol: Dosage varies based on the formulation.

#### **Children:**

- Dosing is based on age and weight. Consult a healthcare professional or refer to specific product labeling. Generally not recommended for children under 4 years old.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and titrate based on patient response and tolerability due to potential age-related decline in hepatic and renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment is required for levocetirizine. Consult a medical professional for specific dose recommendations. See below for more detailed adjustments.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution. Dosage adjustments may be necessary for both dextromethorphan and levocetirizine.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or other significant medical conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- This particular combination is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Levocetirizine: 
    - Mild renal dysfunction (CrCl 50-80 mL/min): 2.5 mg orally once a day.
    - Moderate renal dysfunction (CrCl 30-50 mL/min): 2.5 mg orally once every other day.
    - Severe renal dysfunction (CrCl 10-30 mL/min): 2.5 mg orally twice a week (administered once every 3-4 days).
    - End-stage renal disease (CrCl < 10 mL/min): Contraindicated.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, constipation, tiredness, upset stomach, sleepiness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), seizures, hallucinations, irregular heartbeat.

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Long-term use of high doses of dextromethorphan can lead to tolerance and dependence. The potential long-term effects of chronic levocetirizine use are not fully known.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe allergic reactions, respiratory depression (with high doses of dextromethorphan), serotonin syndrome (with concurrent use of certain medications, particularly MAOIs).

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation.
- Concurrent or recent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).
- Severe respiratory depression.
- End-stage renal disease for the levocetirizine component.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs): Can cause serious interactions, including serotonin syndrome.
- CNS depressants (alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics): May potentiate drowsiness.
- Other antihistamines: May increase anticholinergic effects.
- Medications metabolized by CYP450 enzymes, particularly CYP2D6 for dextromethorphan.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established. Use only if clearly needed and under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  Prefer single-ingredient medications if possible to target specific symptoms during pregnancy.  While levocetirizine and dextromethorphan are likely safe during breastfeeding, it is important to monitor the infant for potential side effects.
