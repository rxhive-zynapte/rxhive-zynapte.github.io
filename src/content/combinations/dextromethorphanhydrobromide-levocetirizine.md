## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the relief of cough and cold symptoms accompanied by allergic rhinitis.  It targets coughs caused by minor throat and bronchial irritation (common cold, inhaled irritants) and allergies (runny nose, sneezing, itchy eyes).
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antitussive (Dextromethorphan) and Antihistamine (Levocetirizine).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dextromethorphan suppresses the cough reflex by acting on the cough center in the medulla oblongata. Levocetirizine, a second-generation antihistamine, antagonizes histamine H1 receptors, mitigating allergic symptoms.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for this specific combination. Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region. Some possible brand name formulations might include components like zinc or other supportive ingredients.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dextromethorphan acts centrally to suppress the cough reflex. Levocetirizine peripherally blocks histamine H1 receptors, reducing vascular permeability, edema, and itching.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Dextromethorphan:** Well-absorbed orally. Metabolized by the liver (CYP2D6), primarily to dextrorphan (active metabolite). Excreted renally.
    - **Levocetirizine:** Rapidly absorbed orally, minimal first-pass metabolism.  Excreted primarily unchanged in urine.
- **Mode of Action:** Dextromethorphan acts on sigma opioid receptors and NMDA receptors in the cough center, increasing the cough threshold. Levocetirizine competitively inhibits the binding of histamine to H1 receptors on effector cells. Elimination primarily via renal excretion.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Dextromethorphan:** 10-20 mg every 4 hours, or 30 mg every 6-8 hours as needed. Maximum daily dose: 120 mg.
- **Levocetirizine:** 5 mg once daily.

#### **Children:**

- **Dextromethorphan:**  Not recommended for children under 4 years. Consult product labeling for age-specific dosing.
- **Levocetirizine:** Not recommended for children under 6 months. Consult product labeling for age-specific dosing.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and titrate upwards as needed, due to potential for reduced renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment (Levocetirizine):**
    - CrCl 50-80 mL/min: 2.5 mg once daily.
    - CrCl 30-50 mL/min: 2.5 mg every other day.
    - CrCl 10-30 mL/min: 2.5 mg twice weekly.
    - CrCl <10 mL/min: Contraindicated.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dosage adjustments may be required for both components.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, and prostatic hypertrophy.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is typically *not* indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  In these settings, other medications tailored to the specific patient needs are preferred.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments might be necessary based on individual patient response, renal/hepatic function, and potential drug interactions. Always consider patient comorbidities.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Drowsiness
- Dry mouth
- Dizziness
- Nausea
- Tiredness
- Upset stomach
- Sleepiness

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (rash, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis)
- Difficulty urinating
- Serotonin Syndrome
- Stevens-Johnson Syndrome
- Toxic epidermal necrolysis
- Bronchospasm
- Hepatic Dysfunction


### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic complications from prolonged use are generally not expected with this combination, however, tolerance to dextromethorphan's antitussive effects can develop.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs include severe allergic reactions, serotonin syndrome (with certain drug interactions), and hepatotoxicity (rare with dextromethorphan).

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to either dextromethorphan or levocetirizine.
- End-stage renal disease (CrCl < 10 mL/min) for levocetirizine.
- Concurrent use of MAO inhibitors (or within two weeks of discontinuation) with dextromethorphan.
- Use with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment, asthma, glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, and cardiovascular disease.

## **Drug Interactions**

- **MAO Inhibitors:**  Concomitant use with dextromethorphan can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition.
- **Alcohol:**  Increases the sedative effects of both dextromethorphan and levocetirizine.
- **Other CNS Depressants:**  Additive sedative effects with opioids, benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants, and other antihistamines.
- **CYP2D6 Inhibitors/Inducers:** May alter the metabolism of dextromethorphan, affecting its efficacy or toxicity.
- **Rolapitant:** May interact with levocetirizine.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Levocetirizine is generally considered safe during pregnancy. Dextromethorphan should be used only when clearly needed. Consult product labeling and medical advice. 
- **Breastfeeding:**  Both drugs are excreted in breast milk in small amounts. Monitor infants for drowsiness, poor feeding, or irritability. Choose alternative medications if possible, especially if breastfeeding is challenging or milk production is low.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Dextromethorphan: Centrally acting antitussive. Levocetirizine: Peripherally acting H1 receptor antagonist.
- **Side Effects:** Drowsiness, dry mouth, dizziness, nausea.  Rarely: allergic reactions, serotonin syndrome, hepatotoxicity.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, end-stage renal disease (levocetirizine), MAO inhibitor use (dextromethorphan).
- **Drug Interactions:** MAO inhibitors, alcohol, CNS depressants, CYP2D6 inhibitors/inducers.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution.  Monitor infant for adverse effects.
- **Dosage:** See detailed dosage guidelines above.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Respiratory rate, mental status, liver function tests (if prolonged use or high doses).

## **Popular Combinations**

This combination is often formulated with other ingredients for broader symptom relief, such as decongestants (pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine), antipyretics (paracetamol), expectorants (guaifenesin), or zinc.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Assess renal and hepatic function, screen for allergies, and evaluate for potential drug interactions.
- **Specific Populations:** As described in the dosage section.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid alcohol. Caution when operating machinery or driving due to potential drowsiness.
