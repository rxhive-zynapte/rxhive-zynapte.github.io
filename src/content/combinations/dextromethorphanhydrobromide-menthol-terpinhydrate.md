## **Usage**

- This drug is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of **non-productive (dry) cough** due to minor throat and bronchial irritation, often associated with the common cold or inhaled irritants.  It provides a cooling sensation and soothes throat irritation.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antitussive (cough suppressant), expectorant, and topical anesthetic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dextromethorphan suppresses the cough reflex by acting on the cough center in the medulla oblongata within the brainstem. Menthol acts as a topical anesthetic, providing a cooling sensation that soothes throat irritation. Terpin hydrate acts as an expectorant, thinning mucus secretions in the airways and facilitating their expulsion.

## **Alternate Names**

- There are no widely recognized alternate names for this specific combination. However, each ingredient can be referred to by their chemical names: Dextromethorphan hydrobromide, Menthol, and Terpin hydrate.
- **Brand Names:** Glycodin, Terp D, and various other generic formulations.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dextromethorphan primarily affects the central nervous system by suppressing the cough reflex.  Menthol exerts its effects locally in the throat, producing a cooling sensation and mild local anesthesia. Terpin hydrate works on the respiratory system, reducing the viscosity of mucus secretions.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Dextromethorphan is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  Menthol is absorbed through the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat. Terpin hydrate is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, though its absorption can be variable.
    - **Metabolism:** Dextromethorphan is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme. Menthol is metabolized in the liver. The metabolism of terpin hydrate is less well-characterized.
    - **Elimination:**  Dextromethorphan and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine.  Menthol is excreted in the urine and bile. Terpin hydrate is primarily eliminated in the urine.
- **Mode of Action:** Dextromethorphan acts centrally on sigma-1 receptors and also has some activity at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and serotonin and norepinephrine transporters in the brain. Menthol activates TRPM8 receptors, which are cold and menthol-sensitive receptors, leading to a cooling sensation. Terpin hydrate is thought to stimulate bronchial glands, resulting in increased fluid secretion and thinning of mucus.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 10-20 mg orally every 4 hours, or 30 mg orally every 6-8 hours, not exceeding 120 mg in 24 hours.
