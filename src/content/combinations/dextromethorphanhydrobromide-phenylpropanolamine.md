## **Usage**

Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide + Phenylpropanolamine is prescribed for the relief of cough, nasal congestion, and other symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, allergies, and other upper respiratory tract infections.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide: Antitussive (cough suppressant)
* Phenylpropanolamine Hydrochloride: Nasal decongestant

**Mechanism of Action:**

* Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide: Suppresses the cough reflex by acting on the cough center in the medulla oblongata within the brainstem.
* Phenylpropanolamine Hydrochloride: Acts as a sympathomimetic amine, constricting blood vessels in the nasal mucosa, reducing swelling and congestion.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no officially recognized single alternate name for this specific combination. The individual components may be referred to as follows:

* **Dextromethorphan HBr:**  D-Methorphan, DXM, Dextromethorphan hydrobromide
* **Phenylpropanolamine HCl:**  PPA, Phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride

**Brand Names:**  Several brand names market this combination, often with additional ingredients like paracetamol (acetaminophen) or guaifenesin.  Examples include Tuseran Forte and Decolsin.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Dextromethorphan:**  Acts centrally within the brain to suppress the cough reflex without affecting respiratory secretions.  It does not have analgesic (pain-relieving) or addictive properties like opioid cough suppressants.
* **Phenylpropanolamine:**  Produces vasoconstriction in the nasal passages by stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors, thus relieving congestion.  It can also have mild stimulant effects on the central nervous system.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Dextromethorphan:**  Well-absorbed orally.  Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6, into dextrorphan and other metabolites.  Excreted in the urine.
* **Phenylpropanolamine:**  Readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  Metabolized in the liver.  Eliminated primarily through renal excretion.


**Mode of Action:**

* **Dextromethorphan:**  Binds to sigma-1 receptors and, to a lesser extent, NMDA receptors in the central nervous system, suppressing the cough reflex.
* **Phenylpropanolamine:**  Stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle, causing vasoconstriction.


**Elimination Pathways:**

* **Dextromethorphan:** Primarily renal excretion of metabolites.
* **Phenylpropanolamine:**  Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

It is important to note that phenylpropanolamine has been associated with an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke and is no longer available in many countries. Therefore, the following dosage information is based on product information where it is still available and should only be considered in consultation with a doctor where it remains authorized:

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Capsule:** One capsule every 6 hours (consult specific product information for exact strengths).
* **Suspension:** 10 mL every 6 hours.

#### **Children:**

Dosage is dependent on the formulation and should be carefully reviewed based on specific product instructions, weight, and age.  General guidelines (where available) are:

* **2-6 years:** 2.5 mL of suspension every 6 hours.
* **7-12 years:** 5 mL of suspension every 6 hours.


#### **Special Cases:**

The use of this combination is generally avoided in special populations (elderly, renal/hepatic impairment) given the risks associated with phenylpropanolamine.  Consult a physician if considering use in these patients.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination drug is *not* indicated for use in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its use is limited to the relief of cough and cold symptoms.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are usually not recommended due to the risks of phenylpropanolamine.  The use of this drug should be avoided in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.




## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Restlessness
* Insomnia
* Tremors


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Hallucinations
* Seizures
* Hypertensive crisis
* Stroke


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Limited data are available on the long-term effects.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, stroke, hypertensive crisis, and cardiac arrhythmias.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to dextromethorphan or phenylpropanolamine
* Severe cardiovascular disease (including hypertension)
* Hyperthyroidism
* Glaucoma
* Concomitant use of MAOIs
* Use within 14 days of MAOI discontinuation


## **Drug Interactions**

* MAOIs:  Can lead to hypertensive crisis.
* Antidepressants:  May interact with phenylpropanolamine.
* Other medications with sympathomimetic effects:  Can potentiate cardiovascular effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Phenylpropanolamine should be avoided during pregnancy due to potential risks.  Dextromethorphan use should be discussed with a physician to assess the benefit versus risk.  The safety during breastfeeding is not fully established for either drug; therefore, the combination is best avoided.
