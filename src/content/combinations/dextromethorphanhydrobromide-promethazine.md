## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the temporary relief of cough and upper respiratory symptoms (such as runny nose, sneezing, itchy or watery eyes) associated with the common cold or allergies.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antitussive (dextromethorphan) and antihistamine (promethazine).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dextromethorphan suppresses the cough reflex by acting on the cough center in the medulla oblongata. Promethazine blocks the effects of histamine, reducing allergy symptoms.

## **Alternate Names**

- Promethazine DM
- Promethazine with Dextromethorphan
- Promethazine with DM


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dextromethorphan acts centrally on the cough center in the brain. Promethazine exerts its antihistaminic effects by blocking H1 receptors, thereby reducing symptoms like itching, sneezing, and runny nose. It also has anticholinergic and sedative properties.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Both drugs are absorbed orally.
    - **Metabolism:** Both are primarily metabolized in the liver by the CYP2D6 enzyme.
    - **Elimination:**  Primarily eliminated via renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** Dextromethorphan acts on sigma opioid receptors in the central nervous system, suppressing the cough reflex. It does not have analgesic or addictive properties like other opioids. Promethazine competes with histamine for H1 receptor sites on effector cells in the respiratory tract, blood vessels, and gastrointestinal smooth muscle.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Dextromethorphan: Sigma opioid receptor agonist. Promethazine: H1 receptor antagonist.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults and children 12 years and older:**

- 5 mL (1 teaspoon) orally every 4 to 6 hours.
- Maximum: 30 mL in 24 hours.

#### **Children:**

- **6 to 11 years:** 2.5 mL to 5 mL (1/2 to 1 teaspoon) orally every 4 to 6 hours. Maximum: 20 mL in 24 hours.
- **2 to 5 years:** 1.25 mL to 2.5 mL (1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon) orally every 4 to 6 hours. Maximum: 10 mL in 24 hours.

**Note:** This medication is contraindicated in children under 2 years of age due to the risk of fatal respiratory depression.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Lower doses may be necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dose adjustment may be required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, respiratory conditions like asthma or COPD, glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, or bladder neck obstruction.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is generally not indicated for the listed clinical scenarios. Its use is primarily limited to symptomatic relief of cough and cold symptoms.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be necessary based on renal or hepatic function, age, and other patient-specific factors.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Drowsiness
- Dizziness
- Blurred vision
- Dry mouth
- Nausea
- Vomiting

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Respiratory depression
- Extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g., dystonia, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia)
- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
- Seizures
- Allergic reactions (e.g., rash, hives, angioedema)


### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic use of promethazine can lead to tardive dyskinesia.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, respiratory depression, neuroleptic malignant syndrome.


## **Contraindications**

- Children under 2 years of age
- Hypersensitivity to promethazine or other phenothiazines

- CNS depressants (e.g., sedatives, hypnotics, opioids, some antidepressants)
- Anticholinergic drugs
- Antihypertensive medications


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
