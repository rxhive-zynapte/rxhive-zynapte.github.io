## **Usage**

This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, and allergies, such as cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, itching of the nose and throat, and itchy or watery eyes.  It is specifically formulated to address dry coughs.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing:
    - Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide: Antitussive (Cough suppressant)
    - Pseudoephedrine: Nasal Decongestant (Sympathomimetic amine)
    - Triprolidine: Antihistamine (H1 receptor antagonist)


- **Mechanism of Action:**
    - Dextromethorphan works centrally in the medulla oblongata to suppress the cough reflex.
    - Pseudoephedrine constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
    - Triprolidine blocks the effects of histamine, relieving allergy symptoms.


## **Alternate Names**
This combination medication is often referred to as a decongestant-antihistamine-antitussive combination. Brand names include Actifed Dry Coughs, Trifed, Actihist-Co Syrup, and Benylin Dual Action Dry Syrup.



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**
    - Dextromethorphan acts on sigma receptors in the cough center of the brain, suppressing the cough reflex.  It has no analgesic or addictive properties.
    - Pseudoephedrine activates alpha-adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa. This reduces nasal congestion.
    - Triprolidine competitively inhibits H1 histamine receptors, reducing the effects of histamine release, which include sneezing, runny nose, and itching.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - All three components are readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
    - Dextromethorphan is metabolized by the liver, primarily via CYP2D6, to its active metabolite, dextrorphan.
    - Pseudoephedrine is partially metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily by the kidneys.
    - Triprolidine is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for pseudoephedrine and triprolidine, and hepatic metabolism followed by renal excretion for dextromethorphan.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
10 mL (2 teaspoonfuls) every 4-6 hours, up to a maximum of 40 mL in 24 hours.

#### **Children:**

- 2-5 years: 2.5 ml four times a day every 4 hours.
- Under 2 years: Not recommended.


#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:**  Start with a lower dose and monitor closely for adverse effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; dosage adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution; dosage adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, and prostatic hyperplasia.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  This medication is not typically used in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or emergency situations.
