## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** This combination medication is prescribed for the temporary relief of symptoms associated with the common cold, hay fever, or other upper respiratory allergies. These symptoms include dry cough, runny nose, sneezing, itching of the nose or throat, and itchy, watery eyes.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antitussive (Dextromethorphan) and Antihistamine (Triprolidine).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dextromethorphan suppresses the cough reflex by acting on the cough center in the brain. Triprolidine works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction that causes allergy symptoms.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names for the combination exist. Individual components may be known by their chemical names.
- **Brand Names:**  Many brand names exist depending on the region and specific formulation.  Examples include (but are not limited to) Actifed, Robitussin DM.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dextromethorphan acts centrally on the cough center in the medulla to suppress the cough reflex. It does not possess analgesic or addictive properties like opioids, despite structural similarities. Triprolidine is a competitive histamine H1-receptor antagonist, reducing symptoms mediated by histamine release.  It also has anticholinergic properties, which contribute to drying effects on secretions.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Both drugs are absorbed orally. Dextromethorphan is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6, and excreted in the urine. Triprolidine is also metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine.
- **Mode of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Dextromethorphan acts on sigma-1 receptors and NMDA receptors in the brain. It also inhibits serotonin reuptake to some extent. Triprolidine competitively binds to H1 histamine receptors, blocking histamine action.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism followed by renal excretion for both drugs.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Typically, 10-20 mg of Dextromethorphan and 2.5 mg of Triprolidine are administered every 4-6 hours as needed. Formulations may vary, so always refer to the specific product labeling.

#### **Children:**  Dosing is weight and age-dependent. Specific pediatric formulations exist, and it's crucial to follow the recommended guidelines on the product labeling. Generally, this combination is not recommended for children under 6 years old, and some formulations are not appropriate for children under 12 years old.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and monitor closely due to potential increased sensitivity to side effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised, and dose adjustment may be necessary, especially in moderate to severe impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised due to hepatic metabolism of both drugs. Dosage adjustments may be needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with asthma, COPD, glaucoma, cardiovascular disease, prostatic hypertrophy, diabetes, or hyperthyroidism. Consult product labeling or specialist advice as needed.

### **Clinical Use Cases**
