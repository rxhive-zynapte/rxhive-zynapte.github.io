## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily used for the symptomatic relief of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other functional gastrointestinal disorders involving abdominal pain and cramping.  It can also be used to treat other conditions involving abdominal pain and muscle spasms.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Dextropropoxyphene is an opioid analgesic, while Dicyclomine is an anticholinergic antispasmodic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dextropropoxyphene reduces pain perception by binding to mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system. Dicyclomine relaxes the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that stimulates muscle contractions in the gut.

## **Alternate Names**

- This combination medication doesn't have a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN).
- **Brand Names:** Spasmol, Colitab, Spasmon, Colidex, Hyvon Spas HG, Parvon Spas, Spasmcare D, Spasmo Neurovon, Spasmocip Plus, Zoldex Spas.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dextropropoxyphene acts as a mild opioid analgesic, binding to opioid receptors in the central nervous system, thus reducing pain perception. Dicyclomine acts as an anticholinergic, blocking acetylcholine's effect on muscarinic receptors in the GI tract, leading to smooth muscle relaxation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Dextropropoxyphene is well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, and primarily excreted in the urine. Dicyclomine is also absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, and eliminated via renal and biliary pathways.
- **Mode of Action:** Dextropropoxyphene exerts its analgesic effect by binding to mu-opioid receptors in the CNS.  Dicyclomine acts as an anticholinergic agent, blocking the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors in the GI tract, leading to smooth muscle relaxation. 
- **Elimination Pathways:** Dextropropoxyphene is primarily excreted in urine after hepatic metabolism. Dicyclomine is eliminated through both renal and biliary pathways following hepatic metabolism.


## **Dosage**

**It is important to note that Dextropropoxyphene has been withdrawn from the market in many countries due to safety concerns, particularly the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.  Therefore, the following dosage information is provided for historical context and should not be interpreted as a recommendation for current use.**

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and titrate cautiously based on individual tolerance and renal/hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment may be required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustment may be required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised in patients with breathing problems, liver or kidney disease, history of head injury, seizures, adrenal gland disorder, enlarged prostate, and digestive system disorders.
