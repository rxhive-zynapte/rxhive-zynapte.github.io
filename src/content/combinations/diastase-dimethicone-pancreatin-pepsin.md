## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily used to address digestive disorders, particularly those related to insufficient pancreatic enzyme production (exocrine pancreatic insufficiency). It helps in the digestion of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins, alleviating symptoms like indigestion, bloating, gas, and abdominal discomfort. It is also used to relieve symptoms of dyspepsia, epigastric distress, and colic pain in infants due to indigestion and poor appetite.  It is classified as a digestive enzyme supplement and antiflatulent.


## **Alternate Names**

No commonly listed alternate names found. Brand names include Enzocia, Peporil, and Nuzyme.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Diastase:** Breaks down complex carbohydrates (starch) into simpler sugars (maltose) for absorption.
* **Pepsin:**  Breaks down proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids.
* **Pancreatin:** Contains a mixture of enzymes (lipase, amylase, protease) that further digest fats, carbohydrates, and proteins.
* **Dimethicone:** An antifoaming agent that reduces surface tension of gas bubbles, facilitating their expulsion and relieving bloating.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Diastase and Pepsin:** Primarily act within the stomach and small intestine.  Not systematically absorbed.
* **Pancreatin:** Enzymes within pancreatin act locally in the small intestine. Not absorbed.
* **Dimethicone:** Not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; excreted unchanged in feces.

**Mechanism of Action:**

This combination works through the synergistic action of its components.  The enzymes (diastase, pepsin, pancreatin) act directly on ingested food, breaking it down into smaller, absorbable molecules.  Dimethicone works by physically altering the properties of gas bubbles, reducing bloating and discomfort.

**Elimination Pathways:**

* **Diastase, Pepsin, and Pancreatin:** Eliminated through feces as inactive enzymes or breakdown products.
* **Dimethicone:** Excreted unchanged in the feces.
