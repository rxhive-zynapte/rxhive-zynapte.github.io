## **Usage**

Diastase + Pepsin + Simethicone is prescribed for digestive disorders, including dyspepsia (indigestion), flatulence (gas), bloating, infant colic, and abdominal distension.  It is also used to improve digestion and nutrient absorption, especially in individuals with slow digestion or enzyme deficiencies.  This combination medication falls under the pharmacological classifications of digestive aids and antiflatulents. It works by breaking down carbohydrates and proteins, reducing gas and bloating, and relieving stomach discomfort.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication doesn't have a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN).  It is often referred to simply by its component ingredients. Some common brand names include Colicaid EZ, Digras, and others. Different manufacturers in various regions might market it under different trade names.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Diastase:** This amylase enzyme breaks down starch into simpler sugars (maltose and dextrins), aiding carbohydrate digestion.
* **Pepsin:** This proteolytic enzyme breaks down proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids, facilitating protein digestion.
* **Simethicone:** This anti-foaming agent reduces the surface tension of gas bubbles in the gastrointestinal tract, allowing them to coalesce and be expelled more easily, thereby relieving bloating and discomfort.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Diastase and Pepsin are administered orally, with absorption occurring primarily in the small intestine.
* **Metabolism:** Minimal metabolism of the enzymes occurs as they work primarily within the gut lumen.
* **Elimination:** These enzymes are primarily eliminated through fecal excretion.  Simethicone, being inert, is also eliminated unchanged in the feces.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard adult dosage varies depending on the formulation and manufacturer.  A common recommendation for syrup formulations is 5-10 mL after meals, once or twice daily.  Tablet formulations often recommend 2-4 tablets after meals, taken once or twice daily.

#### **Children:**

For infants below 1 year: 0.5 ml - 1 ml daily in single or divided doses.  For children above 1 year: 1 ml daily in single or divided doses during or immediately after a meal.  Dosing should be determined by a pediatrician based on the child's age and weight.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be needed due to age-related changes in renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose modifications may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustments are generally not necessary as the drug isn't significantly metabolized by the liver. However, caution is still recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** For patients with conditions like diabetes, pancreatitis or other gastrointestinal issues, dosing must be carefully considered and adapted by a physician.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific clinical settings is not explicitly defined for this drug combination. It is not generally utilized for the management of conditions that require intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU management. Its use is primarily limited to symptomatic relief of dyspepsia and other related conditions.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments might be required based on factors such as age, coexisting medical conditions (especially renal and hepatic impairment), and individual response to the medication.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal discomfort
* Chills
* Dry mouth


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Fructose intolerance
* Glucose-galactose malabsorption
* Pre-existing gastrointestinal bleeding



## **Drug Interactions**

* Antacids (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide): May reduce the effectiveness of the enzymes.
* H2 receptor antagonists (ranitidine): May impact the effectiveness of the enzymes.
* Proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole): May interfere with the enzymes' activity.
* Anti-diabetic drugs (acarbose, miglitol): Diastase and pepsin may reduce the effectiveness of these medications.
* Alcohol: Can exacerbate heartburn and indigestion.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been definitively established. Consult a physician before use.  Caution is advised, and it is generally recommended to use only if clearly needed and under medical supervision.
