## **Usage**

- Diazepam + Propranolol is prescribed for the management of anxiety disorders, especially when physical symptoms like palpitations and tremors accompany psychological distress.  It is also useful in managing acute alcohol withdrawal symptoms, such as agitation, tremor, and hallucinations. Diazepam is indicated as adjunctive therapy for muscle spasms.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Anxiolytic (Diazepam), Beta-blocker (Propranolol).  Diazepam is also classified as a benzodiazepine, anticonvulsant, and skeletal muscle relaxant.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Diazepam enhances the effect of GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, leading to a calming effect. Propranolol blocks beta-adrenergic receptors, reducing the effects of adrenaline, thus controlling physical symptoms of anxiety such as rapid heartbeat and tremors.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names for the combination exist. However, the individual components have alternate names.
- **Brand Names:** This combination may be available under various brand names depending on the manufacturer and region. Examples may include formulations containing both diazepam and propranolol.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Diazepam acts on the central nervous system by potentiating GABAergic neurotransmission, resulting in sedative, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant effects. Propranolol blocks beta-adrenergic receptors in the peripheral nervous system, primarily affecting the cardiovascular system to reduce heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial contractility. It may also improve essential tremor by modulating beta2-adrenergic receptor activity.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - *Diazepam:* Absorbed well orally, metabolized in the liver by CYP enzymes (primarily CYP2C19 and CYP3A4), and eliminated primarily through renal excretion. Diazepam has a long half-life, leading to potential accumulation with repeated doses.
    - *Propranolol:* Well-absorbed orally but undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver, significantly reducing its bioavailability. Metabolized by CYP2D6, and eliminated through hepatic and renal routes. 
- **Mode of Action:** Diazepam binds to benzodiazepine receptors on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, enhancing GABA's inhibitory effects by increasing chloride ion influx into neurons, which hyperpolarizes them. This effect is responsible for Diazepam's wide range of clinical uses, from managing anxiety to controlling seizures.
Propranolol competitively blocks beta-adrenergic receptors (both beta-1 and beta-2), leading to decreased sympathetic activity and the corresponding physiological changes, such as reduced heart rate.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Diazepam primarily undergoes hepatic metabolism via CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, followed by renal excretion of metabolites. Propranolol is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP2D6, with metabolites excreted via both renal and hepatic routes.

## **Dosage**

Dosage information for this combination is limited. Dosing needs to be carefully determined by a physician based on individual patient needs and response.  Information on the dosage of the individual components is provided.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Diazepam:**  Anxiety: 2-10 mg orally 2-4 times daily, as needed. Muscle Spasm: 2-10 mg orally 3-4 times daily. Adjust dosage according to individual needs.

* **Propranolol:** Hypertension: Initial dose is 40mg twice daily, or 80mg of sustained release once daily. Maximum dose is 640mg daily.


#### **Children:**

* **Diazepam:**  Use with caution. Dosage must be individualized based on weight and condition being treated.

* **Propranolol:**  Use with caution. Dosage must be individualized based on weight and condition being treated.



#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Lower doses of both medications are usually recommended due to age-related decline in hepatic and renal function. Start with the lowest effective dose and titrate slowly.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution advised; dose adjustments of both drugs may be needed based on creatinine clearance.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Significant dose reductions for both Diazepam and Propranolol are often required.


* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring is necessary. Avoid combining Propranolol with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 or with pre-existing respiratory disease and diabetes.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  

* Individual components may be used in several clinical situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dosage must be individualized based on patient factors such as age, weight, renal and hepatic function, and concomitant medications.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Drowsiness, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, dry mouth, bradycardia, hypotension, constipation.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Respiratory depression, bradycardia, heart block, hallucinations, confusion, paradoxical excitement, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Diazepam can cause dependence and withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation. Propranolol can cause rebound hypertension or angina if abruptly stopped. 

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), severe hypotension, respiratory depression, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to either drug. Severe respiratory depression, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, severe liver disease, untreated pheochromocytoma, cardiogenic shock, sinus bradycardia, and greater than first-degree heart block.  Diazepam is also contraindicated in patients with sleep apnea.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Alcohol, opioids, barbiturates, other sedatives, antidiabetic medications, NSAIDs, antiarrhythmics, calcium channel blockers, cimetidine, omeprazole, and drugs metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2. Grapefruit juice can significantly increase Propranolol levels.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Diazepam:**  Use with caution; diazepam is associated with risks to the fetus, particularly in the first and third trimesters. May cause neonatal drowsiness and feeding difficulties if used during breastfeeding.

- **Propranolol:**  Use with caution.  Propranolol crosses the placenta and is present in breast milk. Potential fetal risks include bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and intrauterine growth retardation.
