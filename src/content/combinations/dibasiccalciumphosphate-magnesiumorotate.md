## **Usage**

Dibasic Calcium Phosphate + Magnesium Orotate is primarily prescribed for the prevention and treatment of deficiencies in both calcium and magnesium. This combination is particularly useful in conditions where ensuring adequate levels of these minerals is crucial, such as osteoporosis, osteomalacia, hypoparathyroidism, and conditions characterized by low blood magnesium levels (hypomagnesemia).  It supports bone health, cardiovascular health, and may improve neurological function in individuals with these deficiencies.  Its pharmacological classification can be categorized as a mineral supplement.

The mechanism of action involves providing a bioavailable source of calcium and magnesium, which are essential for various physiological processes. Calcium is vital for bone health, nerve function, muscle contraction, and blood clotting. Magnesium is involved in over 300 enzymatic reactions, supporting cardiovascular health, muscle function, nerve transmission, protein synthesis, energy production, and bone health.


## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for the combination of Dibasic Calcium Phosphate + Magnesium Orotate itself. However, this combination is marketed under various brand names, including Oromag, Magnorate, and Magnibest.  The individual components, of course, have their own chemical designations.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Dibasic Calcium Phosphate provides a source of calcium, essential for bone mineralization, muscle contraction, nerve conduction, and intracellular signaling. Magnesium Orotate provides magnesium, crucial for enzyme function, energy production, protein synthesis, and neuromuscular transmission.  The orotate component may enhance magnesium's cellular uptake.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Both dibasic calcium phosphate and magnesium orotate are absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract.  Calcium absorption can be influenced by factors like vitamin D levels and dietary components. Magnesium orotate is believed to have enhanced absorption compared to other magnesium salts due to the orotate component.
* **Metabolism:**  Dibasic calcium phosphate doesn't undergo significant metabolism. Magnesium is distributed throughout the body and utilized in various metabolic processes.
* **Elimination:** Calcium is primarily excreted through the kidneys and feces. Magnesium is mainly excreted renally.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The typical adult dosage ranges from 1 to 2 tablets per day, depending on the specific product and the severity of the deficiency.  It's essential to follow the healthcare professional's recommendation.

#### **Children:**

Pediatric dosing should be determined by a pediatrician and is usually based on the child's weight and the specific condition being addressed.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is often required in patients with impaired kidney function.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific adjustments are typically needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider underlying conditions and potential drug interactions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific clinical settings should be determined by the attending physician based on individual patient needs.  There isn't standardized dosing for specific clinical procedures like intubation or surgical procedures.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on individual patient needs and should be made under the guidance of a healthcare professional.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Generally, this combination is well-tolerated.  Some individuals may experience mild gastrointestinal discomfort, such as constipation or diarrhea.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Rarely, hypercalcemia (elevated blood calcium) or hypermagnesemia (elevated blood magnesium) may occur, especially with high doses or in individuals with impaired renal function.

### **Long-Term Effects**

No significant long-term adverse effects are typically associated with appropriate use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs are rare.  Monitor for signs of hypercalcemia or hypermagnesemia.



## **Contraindications**

Contraindications include hypercalcemia, hypermagnesemia, and known hypersensitivity to any of the components.  Use with caution in patients with severe renal impairment.


## **Drug Interactions**

This combination may interact with certain medications, including some antibiotics (e.g., tetracyclines, quinolones), bisphosphonates, and thyroid hormones.  It's essential to disclose all medications and supplements to the healthcare provider.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult with a healthcare professional before using during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  While generally considered safe, individualized assessment is necessary.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Provides bioavailable calcium and magnesium to address deficiencies.
* **Side Effects:** Generally well-tolerated; mild gastrointestinal issues may occur.
* **Contraindications:** Hypercalcemia, hypermagnesemia, hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:** May interact with certain antibiotics, bisphosphonates, and thyroid hormones.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult a healthcare professional before use.
* **Dosage:**  Varies based on individual needs; typically 1-2 tablets daily for adults.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Serum calcium and magnesium levels, especially in patients with renal impairment.

## **Popular Combinations**

This combination itself is a common pairing. Occasionally, it might be combined with vitamin D for enhanced calcium absorption.


## **Precautions**

Assess for pre-existing conditions like renal impairment. Monitor serum calcium and magnesium levels.  Advise patients about potential gastrointestinal side effects.
