## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the management of pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, back pain, and post-operative pain.  It also aids in reducing swelling.  It combines the analgesic and anti-inflammatory action of diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), with the gastroprotective effects of famotidine, an H2 receptor antagonist, and the anti-inflammatory and proteolytic action of serratiopeptidase.

* **Pharmacological Classifications:**
    * Diclofenac: Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID), Analgesic
    * Famotidine: H2 Receptor Antagonist (Antacid)
    * Serratiopeptidase: Proteolytic enzyme, Anti-inflammatory


* **Mechanism of Action:**
    * Diclofenac: Inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, thereby decreasing pain and inflammation.
    * Famotidine: Reduces gastric acid production by blocking H2 receptors in the stomach, protecting against NSAID-induced ulcers.
    * Serratiopeptidase: Breaks down fibrin, a protein involved in inflammation and blood clotting, thereby reducing swelling and facilitating tissue repair.


## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific three-drug combination. However, each individual component has various generic and brand names.  Brand names for combinations containing these ingredients vary regionally. Some examples from India include Yekin-S (Diclofenac, Famotidine, and Serratiopeptidase).


## **How It Works**

* **Pharmacodynamics:**  The combined effect results in reduced pain, inflammation, and swelling. Famotidine minimizes the gastric side effects often associated with diclofenac.
* **Pharmacokinetics:**
    * Diclofenac: Well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, excreted renally.
    * Famotidine:  Absorbed orally, partially metabolized in the liver, excreted renally.
    * Serratiopeptidase: Absorbed orally, mechanism of metabolism and excretion less well-defined.
* **Mode of Action:** Diclofenac inhibits COX enzymes. Famotidine blocks H2 receptors. Serratiopeptidase breaks down fibrin.
* **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Diclofenac: COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition. Famotidine: H2 receptor blockade.
* **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for diclofenac and famotidine.
