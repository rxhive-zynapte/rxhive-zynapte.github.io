## **Usage**

Diclofenac + Famotidine is prescribed for the relief of pain and inflammation associated with various musculoskeletal conditions like osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. It also addresses pain stemming from other sources such as muscle injuries, toothaches, and menstrual cramps.  Famotidine is included in this combination specifically to mitigate the gastrointestinal side effects often associated with Diclofenac.

It's **pharmacological classifications** are:

* **Diclofenac:** Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID), analgesic, antipyretic
* **Famotidine:** H2-receptor antagonist

**Mechanism of Action:** Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, thereby decreasing pain and inflammation. Famotidine blocks histamine H2-receptors in the stomach, reducing gastric acid production, thus protecting against NSAID-induced ulcers.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no internationally recognized non-proprietary name for this specific combination.  The individual components are sometimes referred to by their chemical names.

**Brand Names:** Numerous brand names exist for this combination, varying by region and manufacturer. Several sources mention a Diclofenac, Paracetamol, and Famotidine combination, though specific brand names for Diclofenac + Famotidine are not readily available in the provided sources.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Diclofenac exerts its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects through COX enzyme inhibition, limiting prostaglandin production. Famotidine decreases gastric acid secretion by blocking H2-receptors in parietal cells.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Diclofenac:**  Well-absorbed orally.  Metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP enzymes (mainly CYP2C9). Excreted via renal and biliary routes.
* **Famotidine:**  Incompletely absorbed orally.  Partially metabolized in the liver. Excreted primarily by the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** Diclofenac binds to and inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, leading to decreased prostaglandin synthesis. Famotidine competitively inhibits histamine at H2-receptors of gastric parietal cells, reducing gastric acid secretion.

**Elimination Pathways:** Diclofenac undergoes hepatic metabolism, with both renal and hepatic excretion of metabolites. Famotidine is primarily renally excreted, with partial hepatic metabolism.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Dosage information for the combination is not available in the given sources. However, typical Diclofenac oral dosages range from 50 mg two to three times a day up to 75 mg twice daily, or 100mg for extended release once daily, depending on the indication.  Famotidine is typically 20 mg twice daily or 40 mg once daily for most indications.  It is crucial to follow the specific prescription from a physician.

#### **Children:**

Safety and effectiveness in children haven't been established for this specific combination.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary. Lower initial doses and careful monitoring are recommended.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose reduction of both Diclofenac and Famotidine may be required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustments of Diclofenac may be necessary. Monitor liver function.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration and potential dose modifications are needed for patients with pre-existing conditions like cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal disorders, or bleeding disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not provided in the sources for this specific combination.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications should be individualized based on patient-specific factors like renal and hepatic function, comorbid conditions, and response to therapy.  Consultation with a nephrologist or hepatologist may be necessary for patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, constipation, dizziness, headache.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, perforation, renal impairment, cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke), allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), hepatic dysfunction, blood disorders.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular complications, gastrointestinal issues.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to Diclofenac or Famotidine, active gastrointestinal bleeding, severe renal or hepatic impairment, history of asthma, urticaria or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs, perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, late pregnancy.

## **Drug Interactions**

Anticoagulants (warfarin, heparin), other NSAIDs, aspirin, diuretics, corticosteroids, lithium, methotrexate, certain antihypertensives.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Diclofenac is contraindicated in late pregnancy due to the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. Famotidine is considered generally safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Diclofenac: COX inhibitor, reduces inflammation and pain; Famotidine: H2-receptor antagonist, reduces gastric acid.
* **Side Effects:** GI upset, dizziness, headache; rarely: GI bleeding, renal/hepatic dysfunction, cardiovascular events.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, active GI bleeding, severe renal/hepatic impairment, late pregnancy.
* **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, NSAIDs, aspirin, diuretics, corticosteroids, lithium.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Diclofenac contraindicated in late pregnancy; Famotidine generally safe.
* **Dosage:**  Determined by a physician based on individual needs.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, liver function, blood pressure, signs of GI bleeding.
