## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the relief of pain and spasms associated with smooth muscle conditions, particularly in the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts.  It is commonly used to treat conditions such as renal or biliary colic, intestinal colic, and dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation).

**Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product with each component having a different classification.

* Diclofenac: Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID)
* Fenpiverinium: Anticholinergic/Antimuscarinic
* Pitofenone: Spasmolytic, Calcium Channel Blocker

**Mechanism of Action:** Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and thereby decreasing inflammation and pain.  Fenpiverinium blocks muscarinic receptors, inhibiting parasympathetic activity, which reduces smooth muscle contractions and spasms. Pitofenone is a direct-acting spasmolytic that relaxes smooth muscles, possibly by acting as a calcium channel blocker.  The combined action provides pain relief and smooth muscle relaxation.


## **Alternate Names**

There is no internationally recognized non-proprietary name for this combination. It is often referred to by its components.

**Brand Names:** Some common brand names include Spastal, Ketospas, Superspas, Spasmogan, Spasnac.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Diclofenac exerts its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2, thus reducing prostaglandin production. Fenpiverinium acts as an anticholinergic agent, blocking the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors in smooth muscle, reducing spasms.  Pitofenone directly relaxes smooth muscle, potentially by inhibiting calcium channels.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Diclofenac is well absorbed orally and is metabolized primarily in the liver, excreted by the kidneys. Fenpiverinium's pharmacokinetic profile when given in combination with diclofenac and pitofenone is not well established, but it is known to be poorly absorbed and to have a shorter duration of action when compared to other anticholinergics. Pitofenone is also well absorbed orally and is believed to have a long half life.  More information is needed for exact pathways of each when combined with diclofenac and pitofenone.


**Mode of Action:** Diclofenac inhibits COX enzymes, leading to decreased prostaglandin synthesis. Fenpiverinium blocks muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, reducing smooth muscle contractions.  Pitofenone's mechanism may involve blocking calcium channels to reduce smooth muscle activity, acting similarly to papaverine.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Diclofenac: COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme inhibition.  Fenpiverinium: Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. Pitofenone:  Possible calcium channel blockade. Exact cellular interactions are not fully characterized when combined with diclofenac and pitofenone.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Diclofenac is primarily metabolized by the liver through several pathways including CYP2C9 and is excreted mainly by the kidneys.  Fenpiverinium is also excreted through the kidneys. Pitofenone's elimination hasn't been characterized when combined with diclofenac and pitofenone.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The typical dose is one tablet containing 50mg diclofenac, 0.1mg fenpiverinium, and 5mg pitofenone, taken two to three times a day.  The maximum recommended daily dose of diclofenac is 150mg. It should be taken with food.

#### **Children:** This combination is generally not recommended for use in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established for pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lowest effective dose and monitor closely for adverse effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised, and dose adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, and dose adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal disorders, or a history of peptic ulcers.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination isn't typically used in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU.  Its use is primarily focused on managing pain and spasms in ambulatory patients.  In emergency situations requiring pain management, other options are generally preferred.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on patient-specific factors, including renal and hepatic function, co-morbidities, and potential drug interactions.  For elderly patients or those with renal/hepatic impairment, the lowest effective dose should be used.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, stomach pain, indigestion, loss of appetite, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**  Gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer, allergic reactions, liver dysfunction, kidney damage, cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke), blood disorders.


### **Long-Term Effects:**  Long-term use, especially at higher doses, increases the risk of gastrointestinal and renal complications.  Regular monitoring is advised.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** Any signs of allergic reaction, gastrointestinal bleeding, or changes in renal/hepatic function should prompt immediate discontinuation of the drug and appropriate medical intervention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any of the components.
* Active peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Severe heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV).
* Severe hepatic or renal impairment.
* Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
* Third trimester of pregnancy.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **NSAIDs, anticoagulants, antihypertensives:** Increased risk of bleeding.
* **Lithium, digoxin, methotrexate:** Increased toxicity of these drugs.
* **Diuretics, ACE inhibitors:** Reduced effectiveness of these drugs.
* **Alcohol:** Increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects.
* **CYP2C9 inhibitors/inducers:**  May affect diclofenac metabolism.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Not recommended during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, due to the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in the fetus.

**Breastfeeding:** It is not known whether these drugs are excreted in breast milk, so caution is advised.  If use is necessary, consider potential risks to the infant.
