## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** This topical combination medication is prescribed for the relief of musculoskeletal pain, including muscle pain, joint pain, arthritis pain, and neuropathic pain (nerve damage).
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID - diclofenac), an anticonvulsant/neuropathic pain agent (gabapentin), and a counterirritant (methyl salicylate).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Diclofenac inhibits COX enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis. Gabapentin modulates calcium channel activity in nerve cells, reducing neuronal excitability. Methyl salicylate acts as a counterirritant, causing local vasodilation and a warming sensation that distracts from deeper pain, and converts to salicylic acid, which has anti-inflammatory properties.

## **Alternate Names**

- This medication is often referred to by its component names.
- Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer. Some possible brand names include Orthogabapain 3D Ointment, Diclosal Plus Cream.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Diclofenac reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting COX enzymes and prostaglandin synthesis. Gabapentin decreases neuronal excitability by modulating calcium channels, effectively reducing pain signals, especially in neuropathic pain. Methyl salicylate acts as a counterirritant, creating a warming sensation and diverting pain signals, and converts to salicylic acid with inherent anti-inflammatory effects.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Systemic absorption of the combined product is influenced by the concentration of ingredients, skin integrity at the application site, and use of occlusive dressings.  Diclofenac is metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Gabapentin is not extensively metabolized and is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Methyl salicylate is metabolized to salicylic acid and then further metabolized in the liver.

- **Mode of Action:**  Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes. Gabapentin binds to the alpha-2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels. Methyl salicylate activates TRP channels.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Diclofenac is primarily eliminated via renal excretion following hepatic metabolism. Gabapentin is predominantly eliminated unchanged through renal excretion. Methyl salicylate is converted to salicylic acid, which undergoes hepatic metabolism and is then eliminated through renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

Dosage depends on the specific formulation and concentration of each ingredient.  Always follow product label instructions or the healthcare provider's recommendations.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Typically, a pea-sized amount of gel/cream/ointment is applied to the affected area 3-4 times daily.

#### **Children:**

- Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established, and use is generally not recommended. Consult a pediatrician.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a low dose and monitor for adverse effects, adjusting as needed.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution and adjust the dosage based on renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution and adjust the dosage for impaired metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or gastrointestinal issues.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is not typically used in acute care settings (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations). It's primarily used for chronic musculoskeletal pain in outpatient settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are made based on patient response, tolerability, and underlying medical conditions. Renal and hepatic function should be carefully considered.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Application site reactions: itching, irritation, redness, burning sensation, dryness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing).
- Systemic absorption of diclofenac can potentially lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, fluid retention, or hypertension.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Prolonged use of topical diclofenac, especially at high doses, might increase the risk of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular complications.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Any serious ADRs should be reported to the appropriate pharmacovigilance authorities.



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to diclofenac, gabapentin, methyl salicylate, or other components.
- History of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) or allergic reactions to NSAIDs.
- Late pregnancy (third trimester).


## **Drug Interactions**

- Oral NSAIDs: Concurrent use may increase the risk of systemic adverse effects.
- Anticoagulants: Diclofenac may potentiate effects and increase bleeding risk.
- Antihypertensives: Diclofenac may decrease their effectiveness.
- Lithium: Diclofenac may increase lithium levels.
- Other topical products containing capsaicin, menthol, or methyl salicylate:  May increase risk of adverse effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Not recommended during the third trimester. Use during the first and second trimesters only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk.
- **Breastfeeding:** Limited data; consult a physician.
