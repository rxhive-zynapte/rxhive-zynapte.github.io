## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for topical relief of pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal conditions like sprains, strains, bruises, back pain, and arthritis. It falls under the pharmacological classifications of:

* **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID):** (Diclofenac)
* **Local anesthetic:** (Lidocaine)
* **Muscle relaxant:** (Mephenesin)
* **Counterirritants:** (Menthol and Methyl Salicylate)
* **Emollient:** (Linseed Oil)


The mechanism of action involves a multifaceted approach: Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and inflammation. Lidocaine blocks nerve signals, reducing pain sensation. Mephenesin acts centrally to relax muscles. Methyl salicylate and menthol act as counterirritants, creating warming and cooling sensations that distract from pain. Linseed oil enhances penetration of active ingredients.

## **Alternate Names**

This specific combination doesn't have a single generic name. It is sometimes referred to by brand names such as Lignogesic gel.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Diclofenac reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting COX enzymes, decreasing prostaglandin synthesis. Lidocaine blocks sodium channels, inhibiting nerve impulse transmission and producing local anesthesia. Mephenesin acts on the central nervous system to relax skeletal muscles. Methyl salicylate and menthol cause vasodilation, creating warming and cooling sensations that distract from pain perception.

**Pharmacokinetics:** When applied topically, diclofenac is absorbed through the skin, reaching therapeutic levels in underlying tissues and joints. Lidocaine absorption is limited, primarily exerting a local effect. Systemic absorption of other components is minimal. Diclofenac is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Lidocaine is metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine.

**Mode of Action:**  Diclofenac's mode of action is COX enzyme inhibition, specifically COX-1 and COX-2, reducing prostaglandin production. Lidocaine blocks voltage-gated sodium channels in nerve axons, inhibiting action potential propagation. Mephenesin's mode of action is not fully understood but it is believed to act on the central nervous system, possibly as a central muscle relaxant.  Methyl Salicylate and Menthol stimulate TRP channels in the skin to produce cooling and warming sensations.

**Elimination Pathways:** Diclofenac is primarily excreted by the kidneys, with some biliary excretion. Lidocaine is metabolized by the liver and excreted in urine.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer to the affected area 3-4 times daily. The amount applied depends on the size of the affected area, usually 2-4 grams of gel (a circular mass approximately 2-2.5 cm in diameter).


#### **Children:** Use in children below 14 years is generally not recommended. For children aged 6 to 12 (for some formulations without mephenesin and lidocaine), application may be limited to twice daily with a 2-gram dose, under strict medical supervision. Consult product-specific guidelines.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically needed, but start with a lower dose and monitor closely for adverse events.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Monitor renal function.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution and at lower doses. Monitor liver function.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with asthma, a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, or cardiovascular diseases.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

This topical formulation is not intended for clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are generally not required except in special cases as mentioned above.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Application site reactions (burning, irritation, itching, redness, rash, dryness).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis). Systemic side effects like gastrointestinal issues or kidney problems are rare with topical use.


### **Long-Term Effects**

Prolonged topical use may cause skin thinning or irritation. Systemic side effects are rare with topical application.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions requiring immediate discontinuation and medical attention.




## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any component.  History of asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Third trimester of pregnancy. Open wounds or broken skin. Age below 6 or 14 years, depending on the formulation. 


## **Drug Interactions**

May interact with oral NSAIDs, anticoagulants (warfarin), diuretics, and some antihypertensives.  Concomitant use of other topical medications on the same area should be avoided unless specifically prescribed by a doctor.  


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Avoid use during the third trimester. Use during the first and second trimesters only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  Consult a doctor before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Excretion in breast milk is minimal with topical diclofenac, but avoid application on the nipple area to minimize infant exposure.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Multimodal â€“ NSAID (diclofenac), local anesthetic (lidocaine), muscle relaxant (mephenesin), counterirritants (menthol, methyl salicylate), emollient (linseed oil).
* **Side Effects:** Application site reactions (burning, itching, redness), rarely allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, aspirin-sensitive asthma, third trimester of pregnancy.
* **Drug Interactions:** Oral NSAIDs, anticoagulants, diuretics, antihypertensives.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid in the third trimester. Consult a doctor before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** Apply topically 3-4 times daily, 2-4 grams per application.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for local skin reactions and any systemic side effects. Renal and liver function tests may be warranted for prolonged use or in patients with pre-existing conditions.
