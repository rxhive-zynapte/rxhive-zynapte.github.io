## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** This topical medication is prescribed for the relief of pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal and joint conditions such as sprains, strains, bruises, tendinitis, bursitis, backache, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other soft tissue rheumatism.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) combined with counterirritants and a skin soother.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Diclofenac reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which are responsible for producing prostaglandins. Methyl salicylate and menthol act as counterirritants, creating warming and cooling sensations respectively, which distract from pain perception. Linseed oil, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, adds anti-inflammatory effects and facilitates drug penetration.

## **Alternate Names**

- No officially recognized alternate names for this specific combination exist.
- Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer. Some examples include:  Muscoleve, Krishat Relief Gel,  Diclotal+ Gel, Lofnac Gel, Fixache Gel.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Diclofenac inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, thus mitigating pain and inflammation. Methyl salicylate and menthol stimulate peripheral nerve endings, creating a sensation of warmth or coolness that masks pain signals. Linseed oil may provide additional anti-inflammatory effects through its omega-3 fatty acids.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Topical application leads to minimal systemic absorption of diclofenac. The other components primarily exert local effects. Metabolism and elimination pathways for absorbed diclofenac are similar to oral forms (primarily hepatic metabolism and renal excretion).
- **Mode of Action:** Diclofenac primarily targets COX enzymes. Methyl salicylate and menthol act on TRP channels (TRPV1 and TRPM8 respectively), influencing sensory nerve signaling. Linseed oil's action is related to the anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3 fatty acids.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Apply a thin layer to the affected area 3-4 times daily. The amount of gel per application can range from 2-4 grams, depending on the size of the affected area. Do not exceed 32 grams of diclofenac-containing product per day across all treated areas.

#### **Children:** Not recommended for children under 14 years of age due to limited safety and efficacy data. For older children, consultation with a doctor is essential.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to potential increased risk of adverse effects, especially gastrointestinal issues and renal impairment.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution and under close medical supervision.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution and under close medical supervision.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised in patients with asthma, cardiovascular disease, bleeding disorders, peptic ulcers, and gastrointestinal problems.



### **Clinical Use Cases**  

The drug is primarily used for localized pain relief in outpatient settings and is not typically applied during intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or in the ICU or for emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**  

Dose adjustments may be necessary for elderly patients and those with renal or hepatic dysfunction. The lowest effective dose for the shortest duration should be used in these populations.
