## **Usage**

This topical medication is prescribed for the relief of pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal conditions such as sprains, strains, bruises, soft tissue rheumatism, arthritis, backaches, fibrositis, lumbago, sciatica, stiff neck, tennis elbow, rheumatic pain, and chilblains.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
* Analgesic (pain reliever)
* Counterirritant
* Emollient

**Mechanism of Action:**

Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing the production of prostaglandins, which are key mediators of pain and inflammation. Menthol and methyl salicylate act as counterirritants, producing cooling and warming sensations, respectively, that distract from pain. Oleum lini (linseed oil) provides emollient properties and may contribute to reducing inflammation.

## **Alternate Names**

Diclofenac Diethylamine + Linseed Oil + Methyl Salicylate + Menthol Gel; KRISHAT RELIEF GEL (in some regions).  Several brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

Diclofenac inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis. Menthol and methyl salicylate act as counterirritants, stimulating peripheral nerve endings to produce cooling and warming sensations that mask pain signals.  Oleum lini provides emollient and moisturizing effects to the skin.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

Topical application results in minimal systemic absorption. Diclofenac that is absorbed is primarily metabolized in the liver via conjugation and oxidation and excreted by the kidneys. Small amounts are also eliminated through the bile.

**Mode of Action:**

Diclofenac's primary mechanism involves the non-selective inhibition of COX enzymes. Methyl salicylate, after skin absorption, is hydrolyzed to salicylic acid which also inhibits COX enzymes and exerts anti-inflammatory effects. Menthol and Methyl Salicylate activate TRPM8 receptors, causing a cooling sensation. Oleum Lini or linseed oil, rich in alpha-linolenic acid, softens the skin and possibly inhibits inflammatory mediators.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply an approximately one-inch band (around 3cm) of gel to the affected area three to four times daily, rubbing gently until the gel disappears. Do not apply more than 32 grams per day over all affected joints. For single joints in the upper body do not exceed 8 grams per day and for single joints of the lower body do not exceed 16 grams per day. The quantity may vary based on the size of the affected area.


#### **Children:**

This combination product is typically not recommended for children under 12 years of age. Consult a pediatrician for guidance if considering use in younger patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required, but close monitoring for adverse effects is essential.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised; systemic absorption is minimal, but monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised. Systemic absorption is minimal, but monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate on a case-by-case basis, considering potential drug interactions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This topical medication is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. It is primarily intended for outpatient musculoskeletal pain management.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be needed for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, though systemic absorption is minimal. Always consider individual patient factors and potential drug interactions when determining the appropriate dosage.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Application site reactions (itching, irritation, redness, burning sensation)
* Dry skin

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

With topical application, long-term systemic side effects are rare due to limited absorption. However, prolonged use may increase the risk of local skin reactions.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Serious skin reactions or allergic reactions require immediate medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any component of the gel
* History of asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs, especially aspirin-sensitive asthma.
* Third trimester of pregnancy

## **Drug Interactions**

Clinically significant interactions with topical application are rare due to limited systemic absorption. However, concomitant use of oral NSAIDs may increase the risk of systemic side effects. Caution should be exercised with:
* Oral NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen)
* Anticoagulants/antiplatelet medications (e.g., warfarin, heparin)
* Immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine)
* Topical salicylates may potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.
* Menthol (when taken orally) might reduce warfarin's effectiveness.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be under the guidance of a physician. While systemic absorption is minimal, the benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the fetus or neonate.  Avoid use during the third trimester of pregnancy. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk.
