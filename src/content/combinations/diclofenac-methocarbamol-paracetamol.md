## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily used for short-term pain relief and muscle spasm reduction associated with musculoskeletal conditions like sprains, strains, and other injuries. It may also be prescribed for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other painful musculoskeletal conditions.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination drug belonging to multiple classes:
    - Diclofenac: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
    - Methocarbamol: Centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant
    - Paracetamol (Acetaminophen): Analgesic and antipyretic
- **Mechanism of Action:** Diclofenac inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, reducing pain and inflammation. Methocarbamol depresses the central nervous system, leading to muscle relaxation. Paracetamol increases the pain threshold and reduces fever.

## **Alternate Names**

- Internationally, Paracetamol is known as Acetaminophen.
- The combination may be referred to as Diclofenac-Methocarbamol-Paracetamol or Diclofenac-Methocarbamol-Acetaminophen.
- Brand names vary regionally; Robinaxol D is a known example.  Other brand names for combination products containing these ingredients may exist.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Diclofenac exerts its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thereby reducing prostaglandin synthesis. Methocarbamol's muscle relaxant properties are attributed to its central nervous system depressant action, possibly by blocking nerve impulses. Paracetamol's precise mechanism is unclear but is believed to involve inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the central nervous system and action on the hypothalamic heat-regulating center.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Diclofenac is well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP2C9, and excreted through the kidneys. Methocarbamol is also well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, and eliminated primarily in the urine. Paracetamol is rapidly absorbed, metabolized in the liver, and excreted by the kidneys.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Diclofenac inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.  Methocarbamol's mechanism is not fully elucidated, but it is thought to act centrally rather than directly on muscle tissue. Paracetamolâ€™s mechanism is not fully understood but involves central COX inhibition.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Diclofenac, Methocarbamol, and Paracetamol are all primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The typical adult dosage is one tablet containing 50mg Diclofenac, 500mg Paracetamol (or Acetaminophen), and 500mg Methocarbamol, taken three times a day after meals. This dosage may be adjusted based on individual patient needs and the severity of the condition.  Do not exceed 8g of Paracetamol per day from all sources.

#### **Children:**

- This combination is generally not recommended for children under 12 years of age. For children above 12, dosage should be determined by a physician and carefully monitored.  Pediatric safety considerations include potential adverse effects on the liver and kidneys.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Lower doses are recommended due to age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment is necessary, especially in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Monitor renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment is crucial, as both Diclofenac and Paracetamol are metabolized in the liver. Monitor hepatic function.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration and potential dose adjustments are necessary in patients with conditions such as cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal disorders, or a history of peptic ulcers.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- The combination of Diclofenac, Methocarbamol, and Paracetamol is generally *not* recommended for clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. In such cases, more targeted and potent medications are typically indicated.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose modifications are essential based on patient factors like renal/hepatic dysfunction, age, and concomitant medications. Close monitoring of renal and hepatic function is necessary.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Nausea, vomiting, heartburn, stomach pain, diarrhea, loss of appetite, sleepiness, dizziness, headache, blurred vision, and dry mouth.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions, gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration, liver damage, kidney problems, cardiovascular events (such as heart attack or stroke), blood disorders, and central nervous system effects (such as seizures or confusion).

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Prolonged use of NSAIDs like Diclofenac can increase the risk of gastrointestinal issues, cardiovascular complications, and renal problems.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe allergic reactions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, severe liver injury, acute renal failure, and agranulocytosis.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any component of the combination, active gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers, severe liver or kidney impairment, aspirin triad (asthma, nasal polyps, and aspirin sensitivity), coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and late pregnancy.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Other NSAIDs, corticosteroids, anticoagulants (like warfarin), antihypertensives, diuretics, lithium, methotrexate, certain antidepressants (like SSRIs), alcohol, and other drugs that cause drowsiness.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Diclofenac is contraindicated during the third trimester. Its use in the first and second trimesters should be carefully considered and avoided unless absolutely necessary. Paracetamol is generally considered safe during pregnancy.  Methocarbamolâ€™s safety during pregnancy hasn't been definitively established.
- **Fetal Risks:** Diclofenac use in the third trimester can cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.
- **Breastfeeding:** Small amounts of these drugs may be excreted in breast milk. Consult with a physician to assess the benefit-risk ratio before using this combination while breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Diclofenac: COX inhibitor; Methocarbamol: Central muscle relaxant; Paracetamol: Analgesic and antipyretic, possibly by central COX inhibition.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, GI upset, liver or kidney problems (rare).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, GI bleeding, severe liver/kidney disease, late pregnancy.
- **Drug Interactions:** NSAIDs, anticoagulants, alcohol, other CNS depressants.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid Diclofenac in the third trimester. Consult a physician before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** Standard adult: One tablet (50mg Diclofenac, 500mg Paracetamol, 500mg Methocarbamol) thrice daily after meals; adjust based on patient specifics.
