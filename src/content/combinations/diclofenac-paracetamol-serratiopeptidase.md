## **Usage**

Diclofenac + Paracetamol + Serratiopeptidase is prescribed for the relief of pain and inflammation associated with various conditions, including:

*   Osteoarthritis
*   Rheumatoid arthritis
*   Ankylosing spondylitis
*   Post-operative pain
*   Dental pain
*   Musculoskeletal pain
*   Soft tissue injuries
*   Other painful inflammatory conditions

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This combination drug includes:

*   **Diclofenac:** Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
*   **Paracetamol:** Analgesic and antipyretic
*   **Serratiopeptidase:** Proteolytic enzyme

## **Alternate Names**

While the generic name is Diclofenac + Paracetamol + Serratiopeptidase, it's marketed under various brand names, some of which are listed in the *Drug Profile Summary* section below. Regional variations may exist.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

*   **Diclofenac:** Inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, thereby decreasing pain and inflammation.
*   **Paracetamol:** Believed to inhibit COX in the central nervous system, providing analgesic and antipyretic effects. The exact mechanism is not fully understood.
*   **Serratiopeptidase:** Breaks down proteins like fibrin, bradykinin, and histamine at the site of inflammation, reducing swelling and edema.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Diclofenac:** Well-absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2C9. Excreted via kidneys and bile.
*   **Paracetamol:** Rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine, primarily as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.
*   **Serratiopeptidase:** Absorbed in the intestines. Mechanism of absorption and metabolism is not fully elucidated.

**Elimination Pathways:**

*   Diclofenac: Renal and hepatic excretion
*   Paracetamol: Renal excretion
*   Serratiopeptidase: Unknown

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One tablet (containing Diclofenac 50mg, Paracetamol 325mg, and Serratiopeptidase 10mg) two to three times daily, preferably after meals. Maximum daily dose is Diclofenac 150mg, Paracetamol 4g, and Serratiopeptidase 60mg.


#### **Children:**

Not recommended for children under 10 years of age as safety and efficacy have not been established. If used, pediatric dosing should be carefully determined and monitored by a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lowest effective dose and monitor closely for adverse effects.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be necessary. Monitor renal function.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction may be necessary. Monitor liver function.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful evaluation and dose adjustment may be required, particularly for patients with cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal disorders, or bleeding disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources do not include dose recommendations for specific medical settings such as Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, or Emergency Situations. Dosage in these settings must be under direct medical supervision and adjusted per patient requirements.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary for patients with renal/hepatic impairment and other relevant comorbidities. Consult the *Special Cases* section above. Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism are not widely studied for this specific combination.
