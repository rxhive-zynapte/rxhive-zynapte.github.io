## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for musculoskeletal pain, inflammation, and muscle spasms.  It is effective in managing conditions such as low back pain, neck pain (including torticollis), sprains, strains, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and post-operative pain.  It falls under the pharmacological classifications of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics, and muscle relaxants.

The mechanism of action involves multiple pathways: Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and thus inflammation and pain. Paracetamol has analgesic and antipyretic effects, likely through central mechanisms and COX inhibition in the brain. Thiocolchicoside is a muscle relaxant acting on the central nervous system, particularly GABA and glycine receptors in the spinal cord, to reduce muscle spasms.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no single international nonproprietary name (INN) for this combination. It is often referred to by the names of its components.  Brand names include Thioquest DP, Flexiwin D, and various others depending on the manufacturer and region.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* Diclofenac: Inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, thereby decreasing inflammation and pain.
* Paracetamol: Analgesic and antipyretic, possibly via central mechanisms and COX inhibition within the CNS.
* Thiocolchicoside: Acts centrally on GABA and glycine receptors in the spinal cord, leading to muscle relaxation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* Diclofenac: Well-absorbed orally, metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP enzymes (mainly CYP2C9), and excreted renally and in bile.
* Paracetamol: Rapidly absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver (glucuronidation, sulfation, and CYP-mediated oxidation), and excreted renally.
* Thiocolchicoside:  Information on absorption, metabolism, and elimination is limited. It is believed to be metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted renally.

**Mode of Action:**

* Diclofenac: Inhibition of COX enzymes blocks the production of prostaglandins, which are key mediators of inflammation and pain.
* Paracetamol: Exact mechanism is unclear but likely involves central action and COX inhibition in the CNS, affecting pain and temperature regulation.
* Thiocolchicoside: Interacts with GABA and glycine receptors in the spinal cord, reducing muscle tone and spasms.

**Elimination Pathways:**

* Diclofenac: Renal and biliary excretion, hepatic metabolism by CYP enzymes (CYP2C9).
* Paracetamol: Renal excretion of metabolites.
* Thiocolchicoside: Primarily renal excretion, hepatic metabolism.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One capsule (containing diclofenac 50 mg, paracetamol 325 mg, and thiocolchicoside 4 mg) twice daily, typically after meals. The maximum recommended dose of thiocolchicoside is 16 mg daily, and for diclofenac, it's 150 mg daily.  Treatment duration should be limited to 7 consecutive days.


#### **Children:**

Not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established in this population.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients**: Use with caution; dose adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Use with caution; dose adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Use with caution; dose adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, asthma, peptic ulcer disease, or gastrointestinal bleeding.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is not typically used in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.  It is primarily intended for outpatient management of musculoskeletal pain and spasms.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be needed for elderly patients and those with renal or hepatic impairment.  Close monitoring of liver function is recommended, especially during long-term use.


## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, heartburn, diarrhea, loss of appetite, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, and skin rashes.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Liver damage, stomach bleeding, allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema), cardiovascular thrombotic events (heart attack, stroke), renal impairment, blood cell disorders (pancreatitis, seizures), severe cutaneous adverse reactions.


### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic complications from prolonged use may include gastrointestinal issues, renal damage, and cardiovascular risks.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Serious ADRs include anaphylaxis, angioedema, severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson Syndrome), hepatotoxicity, gastrointestinal bleeding, and cardiovascular events.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any of the components, active peptic ulcer disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, severe liver or kidney disease, last trimester of pregnancy, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, coronary artery bypass graft surgery.



## **Drug Interactions**

Other NSAIDs, anticoagulants (warfarin), antihypertensives (lisinopril), antidepressants (SSRIs), anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin), oral contraceptives, alcohol.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Contraindicated in the third trimester of pregnancy due to risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Use prior to 20 weeks gestation should be based on a benefit-risk assessment. Use with caution during breastfeeding; monitor infant for adverse effects.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Multimodal: COX inhibition (diclofenac), central analgesic and antipyretic (paracetamol), central muscle relaxation (thiocolchicoside).
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, dizziness, drowsiness, liver damage, stomach bleeding.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, active peptic ulcer, GI bleeding, severe liver/kidney disease, third-trimester pregnancy.
* **Drug Interactions:** Other NSAIDs, anticoagulants, antihypertensives, antidepressants, anticonvulsants.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in the third trimester; caution in breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** One capsule twice daily for up to 7 days.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests, renal function, signs of GI bleeding.


## **Popular Combinations**

While this is already a combination product, in some instances, other medications may be added for enhanced pain relief or to address specific symptoms, although caution is advised due to increased risk of adverse effects.


## **Precautions**


* **General Precautions:** Screen for allergies, assess liver and kidney function, and monitor for GI symptoms.
* **Specific Populations:**  Avoid in the third trimester of pregnancy, use caution during breastfeeding and in elderly patients. Not recommended for children.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid alcohol, driving may be impaired due to drowsiness or dizziness.
