## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Diclofenac + Serratiopeptidase is prescribed for pain and inflammation associated with various conditions, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, post-operative pain, dental pain, sprains, fractures, and lower back pain.  It is effective in managing acute pain arising from tissue damage in muscles, bones, or organs.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This drug is a combination of a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) and a proteolytic enzyme. Diclofenac is the NSAID component, while Serratiopeptidase is the enzyme component.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin production, which are responsible for pain and inflammation. Serratiopeptidase breaks down fibrin, a protein involved in inflammation, and also deactivates bradykinin, another inflammatory mediator.  The combination results in synergistic pain and swelling reduction.


## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for the combination itself. The individual components are sometimes referred to as Diclofenac Sodium or Diclofenac Potassium and Serrapeptase.

- **Brand Names:**  Brand names can vary depending on the manufacturer and region. Some examples include Diclogesic SP,  Lyser-DP,  and Zorvolex (Diclofenac only).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Diclofenac exerts its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, thereby reducing prostaglandin synthesis. Serratiopeptidase reduces swelling and inflammation by breaking down fibrin and other inflammatory mediators.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Diclofenac:**  Well-absorbed orally, peak plasma concentration reached in 1-2 hours.  Metabolized primarily in the liver via CYP2C9. Excreted renally and in bile.
    - **Serratiopeptidase:** Absorbed orally and enters the bloodstream.  Mechanism of absorption and metabolism not fully elucidated.

- **Mode of Action:** Diclofenac acts on COX enzymes, preventing the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. Serratiopeptidase acts directly on fibrin and bradykinin, breaking them down and reducing their inflammatory effects.

- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Diclofenac inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. Serratiopeptidase is a proteolytic enzyme.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Diclofenac is primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.  Elimination pathway of Serratiopeptidase is not fully understood.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  The usual recommended dose is one tablet containing 50 mg Diclofenac and 10 mg Serratiopeptidase two to three times daily. Administer preferably after meals. The maximum daily dose of diclofenac is 150 mg and serratiopeptidase is 60 mg.


#### **Children:** Use is not recommended for children below 18 years of age due to lack of sufficient safety and efficacy data.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Start with the lowest effective dose and monitor closely for adverse effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction may be required. Close monitoring is essential.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal disorders, or bleeding tendencies.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation:** Not typically used.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Commonly used for post-operative pain management.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not indicated.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  May be used for pain management, but with caution.
- **Emergency Situations:** Not the preferred choice for acute emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjust dosage based on patient's age, renal and hepatic function, and other medical conditions.  Individualized dosing is crucial.
