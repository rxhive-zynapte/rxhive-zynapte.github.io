## **Usage**

Diclofenac + Tolperisone is prescribed for acute musculoskeletal pain and spasms. This includes conditions such as low back pain, neck pain, muscle strains and sprains, and muscle spasms related to neurological disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis, stroke) or resulting from trauma or surgery.

It is classified pharmacologically as a combination of a Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID) and a centrally acting muscle relaxant.

The mechanism of action involves two components: Diclofenac inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, reducing pain and inflammation, while Tolperisone acts on the central nervous system to decrease muscle stiffness and spasms by interfering with spinal reflexes.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no officially recognized alternate name for the combination itself. However, the individual components have various names: Diclofenac is sometimes referred to as diclofenac sodium or diclofenac potassium depending upon the salt used, and Tolperisone is known as tolperisone hydrochloride.

Brand names under which this combination is marketed include Myotop-D, Tolperitas-DSR, Tolifast D, Reladol-D, and various others depending upon the manufacturer and region.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Diclofenac, the NSAID component, inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis. This leads to decreased pain and inflammation.  Tolperisone, a centrally acting muscle relaxant, is believed to decrease muscle tone by inhibiting voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels in the central nervous system. It also may block spinal reflexes that mediate muscle contractions, reducing spasms and rigidity without affecting muscle strength.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Diclofenac:** Well absorbed orally.  Peak plasma concentrations occur in 1-2 hours.  Metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP2C9 to several metabolites. Primarily excreted renally.
* **Tolperisone:** Well absorbed orally. Peak plasma levels are reached in about 0.5 to 1 hour. Extensively metabolized in the liver, mostly by CYP2D6. Excreted primarily in the urine.

**Mode of Action (Cellular/Molecular):** Diclofenac blocks COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes at the cellular level. This inhibition prevents the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, which mediate inflammation and pain. Tolperisone acts centrally, possibly at the brainstem reticular formation, by influencing neuronal transmission to reduce muscle tone. Its specific binding sites and molecular targets aren't entirely understood, but modulation of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels and interference with polysynaptic spinal reflexes have been suggested. It does not directly affect neuromuscular transmission or muscle contractility.

**Elimination Pathways:** Diclofenac is mostly excreted in the urine as metabolites, with some biliary excretion.  Tolperisone undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, primarily by CYP2D6, followed by renal excretion of the metabolites.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The typical dose is one tablet containing 150mg Tolperisone and 50mg Diclofenac, taken two to three times daily. It's crucial to swallow tablets whole with water and preferably after a meal.

#### **Children:**

This combination is generally not recommended for children under 18, as safety and efficacy haven't been established.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses due to potential age-related decline in hepatic and renal function. Close monitoring is necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment might be required. Monitor renal function carefully.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dose reduction may be necessary. Closely monitor liver function.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal problems, or asthma.  Dose adjustments may be needed.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Diclofenac + Tolperisone is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its primary role is in the outpatient management of musculoskeletal pain and spasm.  Other medications are preferred in acute medical or surgical settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are made based on patient response, tolerance, and organ function (renal/hepatic). Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism, especially related to CYP2D6 for Tolperisone and CYP2C9 for Diclofenac, should be considered if available.




## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, weakness, loss of appetite, heartburn.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcer, liver damage, kidney problems, cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke), blood disorders.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic use can lead to gastrointestinal issues, renal impairment, and cardiovascular problems.  


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, severe gastrointestinal bleeding, acute renal failure, hepatotoxicity.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to either diclofenac or tolperisone.
* Active peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Severe hepatic or renal impairment.
* History of asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking NSAIDs or aspirin.
* Myasthenia gravis.
* Pregnancy (especially the third trimester).
* Breastfeeding.
* Severe heart failure.
* Recent heart surgery.


## **Drug Interactions**

* Other NSAIDs: Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin): Increased bleeding risk.
* Antiplatelets (e.g., clopidogrel): Increased bleeding risk.
* Corticosteroids: Increased risk of gastrointestinal ulcers.
* SSRIs: Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Diuretics: Decreased diuretic effect, increased risk of renal impairment.
* Digoxin: Increased digoxin levels.
* Methotrexate: Increased methotrexate toxicity.
* Cyclosporine: Increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
* Lithium: Increased lithium levels.
* Alcohol: Increased drowsiness and risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
* CYP450 interactions: Tolperisone is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6, and diclofenac by CYP2C9. Drugs affecting these enzymes can change the drugs' levels and effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Contraindicated during pregnancy, especially the third trimester, as it can cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in the fetus and other complications. Also contraindicated during breastfeeding due to potential adverse effects on the neonate.
