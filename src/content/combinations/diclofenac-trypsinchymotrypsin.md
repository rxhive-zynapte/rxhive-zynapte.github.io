## **Usage**

- Diclofenac + Trypsin Chymotrypsin is prescribed for pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, muscle pain, bone and joint pain, post-operative wounds, edema, hematoma, pelvic inflammatory disease, episiotomy, abdominal hysterectomy, tooth extraction, peri-apical abscess, maxillofacial surgery, soft tissue injuries, fractures, post-surgery pain, and infections in the ear, nose, and throat.  It is also used to manage acute musculoskeletal pain and swelling from injuries.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) and Proteolytic Enzyme combination.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin production, thereby decreasing pain and inflammation. Trypsin and chymotrypsin break down abnormal proteins at the inflammation site, further reducing swelling and promoting healing.

## **Alternate Names**

- Diclofenac Potassium + Trypsin Chymotrypsin
- **Brand Names:** Chymoral Plus, Chymoflam, Chymin-D, Chyxone-DP (with Paracetamol).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Diclofenac, an NSAID, exerts analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis. Trypsin and chymotrypsin, proteolytic enzymes, break down proteins and cellular debris at the injury site, facilitating healing and reducing inflammation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Diclofenac is well-absorbed orally. It is metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2C9, and excreted mainly through the kidneys.  Trypsin and chymotrypsin are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
- **Mode of Action:** Diclofenac's mode of action is through non-selective COX inhibition. Trypsin and chymotrypsin's mode of action involves proteolytic degradation of inflammatory mediators.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Diclofenac is mainly eliminated via renal excretion of metabolites.

## **Dosage**
