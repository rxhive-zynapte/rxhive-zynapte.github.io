## **Usage**

This combination medication, available as a topical gel, is prescribed for the relief of pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal and joint disorders. These include:

* Mild to moderate muscle pain
* Sprains and strains
* Bruises
* Soft tissue rheumatism
* Arthritis
* Backaches
* Fibrositis
* Lumbago
* Sciatica
* Stiff neck
* Tennis elbow
* Rheumatic pain

**Pharmacological Classification:** This topical gel is classified as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) combined with a local anesthetic, counterirritants, and penetration enhancers.

**Mechanism of Action:**  This combination targets pain and inflammation through multiple pathways:

* **Diclofenac diethylamine:** Inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis. This, in turn, decreases pain and inflammation.
* **Lidocaine:** A local anesthetic, blocks nerve signals, providing additional pain relief.
* **Linseed Oil:**  Facilitates diclofenac's penetration through the skin. Its omega-3 fatty acids offer anti-inflammatory benefits.
* **Methyl Salicylate:** Acts as a counterirritant, producing a warming sensation that distracts from deeper pain. It also possesses anti-inflammatory properties.
* **Menthol:** Creates a cooling sensation, acting as another counterirritant, further enhancing pain relief by stimulating cold receptors and dilating blood vessels.


## **Alternate Names**

Diclofenac diethylamine + Lidocaine + Linseed Oil + Menthol + Methyl Salicylate is sometimes referred to as Diclofenac Diethylamine/lidocaine/linseed oil/menthol/methyl salicylate topical.  Various brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region, including  Rafdonac-Ultra Gel.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* Diclofenac, the primary analgesic and anti-inflammatory component, acts by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, thereby suppressing prostaglandin synthesis.
* Lidocaine provides local anesthetic action by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels in neuronal membranes.
* Methyl salicylate and menthol exert their counterirritant effects through activation of TRP channels, leading to sensations of warmth and coolness, respectively.  They also have mild anti-inflammatory properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* Diclofenac is absorbed systemically through the skin, albeit in low amounts when applied topically.
* The liver primarily metabolizes it, and the kidneys excrete the metabolites. The metabolism and elimination pathways are similar to those of oral diclofenac.
* Lidocaine is also absorbed through the skin, but significant systemic absorption is uncommon with topical application.
* Methyl salicylate and menthol are minimally absorbed systemically.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**

* Diclofenac primarily inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.
* Lidocaine interacts with voltage-gated sodium channels.
* Methyl salicylate and menthol modulate TRP channels.

**Elimination Pathways:**

* Diclofenac is primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism followed by renal excretion.
* Lidocaine is metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a thin layer to the affected area 3-4 times daily, rubbing gently until it disappears. The amount should correspond to a 2-4 gram dose or a 4-8cm band if the tube opening is fully open.

#### **Children:**

Use in children below 12 years of age is contraindicated. For adolescents over 12, consult a pediatrician. Some sources indicate it is safe for children above 2 years of age, but caution is advised, especially in children aged 2-12 years, particularly with conditions like viral flu, chickenpox, or viral fever due to the risk of Reye's Syndrome associated with methyl salicylate.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** The usual adult dosage may generally be used, but it's essential to monitor for adverse effects carefully.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised; dosage adjustment might be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advised; dosage adjustment might be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized assessment is crucial. Particular caution is warranted for patients with asthma, cardiovascular disease, or gastrointestinal issues.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication is not typically used in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its primary indication is localized musculoskeletal pain.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are generally not required except in specific cases mentioned above. Always adhere to the prescribing physician's recommendations.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Itching
* Irritation
* Redness
* Burning sensation at the application site
* Dry skin
* Rash

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (e.g., hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Severe skin reactions (e.g., blistering, peeling)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Prolonged use can potentially lead to skin thinning or other skin changes.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions or significant skin irritation necessitate immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation.
* Aspirin-induced asthma or allergic reactions to other NSAIDs.
* Third trimester of pregnancy.
* Open wounds or broken skin.


## **Drug Interactions**

* Topical salicylates may potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.
* Menthol may decrease the effectiveness of warfarin when taken orally.
* Potential interactions with other topical medications exist.
* May interact with oral painkillers (aspirin), anticoagulants (warfarin), anti-rheumatoid drugs (methotrexate), and immunosuppressants (cyclosporine).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use during pregnancy, especially the third trimester, is contraindicated.  Use during breastfeeding should be approached with caution and only when the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks. Consult a physician for guidance.  Safety during pregnancy and lactation hasn't been fully established.
