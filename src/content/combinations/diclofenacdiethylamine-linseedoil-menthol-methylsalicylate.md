## **Usage**

This topical medication is prescribed for the relief of pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal and joint disorders such as:
* Sprains
* Strains
* Bruises
* Soft tissue rheumatism
* Arthritis
* Backache
* Fibrositis
* Lumbago
* Sciatica
* Stiff neck
* Tennis elbow
* Rheumatic pain

**Pharmacological Classification:** 
* Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
* Topical analgesic
* Counterirritant

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination product works through multiple pathways:
* **Diclofenac diethylamine and Methyl salicylate:** Inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin production, which are responsible for pain and inflammation.
* **Linseed oil:**  Softens and moisturizes the skin, facilitating the penetration of other ingredients. Also contains alpha-linolenic acid with anti-inflammatory properties.
* **Menthol:** Creates a cooling sensation by activating TRPM8 receptors, distracting from pain and improving blood flow through vasodilation.
* **Methyl salicylate (wintergreen oil):**  Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis. Warms the skin.


## **Alternate Names**
This combination does not have a universally recognized international non-proprietary name (INN).  Names often reflect the specific combination and concentrations of ingredients.

**Brand Names:** Numerous brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region. Examples include:
* Krishat Relief Gel
* Muscoleve
* Muscodac Gel
* Lofnac Gel
* Qtgesic Gel
* Diclotal+ Gel
* Diclotal-Forte Gel (with added Capsaicin)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**
* **Diclofenac diethylamine and Methyl salicylate:** Reduce pain and inflammation by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, decreasing prostaglandin synthesis.
* **Menthol:** Activates TRPM8 receptors, causing a cooling sensation and vasodilation.
* **Linseed oil:**  Emollient and moisturizing effects. Alpha-linolenic acid contributes to anti-inflammatory action.


**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Diclofenac diethylamine:** After topical application, systemic absorption is low (around 100 times lower than oral administration).  Diclofenac is metabolized primarily in the liver, with metabolites excreted in urine and bile/feces.
* **Methyl salicylate:** Absorbed through the skin, metabolized to salicylic acid, and excreted in urine. Absorption is enhanced by heat, exercise, or skin damage.
* **Menthol and Linseed oil:** Limited systemic absorption after topical use.


**Mode of Action:**  The components of this combination act synergistically:
* **COX inhibition:** Diclofenac and methyl salicylate inhibit COX enzymes, decreasing prostaglandin synthesis, which reduces pain and inflammation.
* **TRP channel modulation:** Menthol activates TRPM8 (cold-sensitive) receptors, creating a cooling sensation, while capsaicin (in some formulations) activates TRPV1 (heat-sensitive) receptors, initially causing a burning sensation followed by desensitization.
* **Enhanced penetration:** Linseed oil facilitates the absorption of other active ingredients into the skin.


**Elimination pathways:**  Primarily renal and hepatic.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults and Children over 14 years:**

* Apply a 2-4 g (approximately 4-8 cm strip or a circular mass of 2.0-2.5 cm diameter) to the affected area 3-4 times daily.
* Gently rub until absorbed.
* Wash hands after application, unless treating hands.
* Do not exceed 32g total daily dose of Diclofenac, or 8g per joint when applied to the upper body.
* Duration of treatment:  Typically, up to 7 days without medical consultation. For osteoarthritis, review treatment after 4 weeks.  Other indications, review after 2 weeks.


#### **Children:** Not recommended for children under 14 years.

#### **Special Cases:**
* **Elderly Patients:** The usual adult dose can be used but monitor for adverse events.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Monitor renal function.  Contraindicated in advanced renal disease.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Monitor liver function.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use cautiously in those with asthma, cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal problems, or bleeding/clotting disorders.


### **Clinical Use Cases**
The medication is primarily used for musculoskeletal pain relief. It's not typically used in settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**
Adjust dosage for renal/hepatic impairment. Monitor for adverse events and adjust accordingly.




## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
* Application site reactions: itching, irritation, redness, burning sensation, dryness


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
* Allergic reactions (skin rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat).
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration (especially with prolonged use or in high doses).
* Increased risk of heart attack or stroke.
* Renal or hepatic dysfunction.



### **Long-Term Effects**
Chronic complications from prolonged topical use are rare due to limited systemic absorption, but include:
* Skin thinning or discoloration.
*  Gastrointestinal issues.
*  Renal or hepatic dysfunction.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
* Anaphylaxis
* Angioedema
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis



## **Contraindications**
* Hypersensitivity to diclofenac, methyl salicylate, menthol, linseed oil, or any other ingredients.
* Aspirin-sensitive asthma.
* History of allergic reaction to NSAIDs.
* Third trimester of pregnancy.
* Advanced renal disease.
* Open wounds or broken skin.


## **Drug Interactions**
* Oral NSAIDs (increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects).
* Anticoagulants (increased risk of bleeding).
* ACE inhibitors (potential for renal dysfunction).
* Other topical medications applied to the same area (potential for interactions).
* Corticosteroids (increased risk of GI side effects)
* Methotrexate (increased toxicity)
* Lithium (increased serum levels)



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
* **Pregnancy:**  Contraindicated during the third trimester. Use with caution during the first and second trimesters only if essential and no safer alternatives exist. Potential for premature closure of fetal ductus arteriosus.
* **Breastfeeding:** Diclofenac passes into breast milk in small amounts. At therapeutic doses, effects on the nursing infant are unlikely, but use with caution and only if clearly needed.



## **Drug Profile Summary**
