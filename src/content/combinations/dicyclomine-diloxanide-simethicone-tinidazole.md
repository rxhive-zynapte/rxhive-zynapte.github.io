## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for treating intestinal amoebiasis, a parasitic infection of the intestines caused by *Entamoeba histolytica*. It also addresses associated gastrointestinal symptoms like bloating, abdominal pain, flatulence, stomach pain, and diarrhea.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination drug with components belonging to the following classifications:
* **Tinidazole:** Antiprotozoal, antibiotic
* **Diloxanide furoate:** Luminal amoebicide
* **Dicyclomine:** Antispasmodic, anticholinergic
* **Simethicone:** Anti-flatulent

**Mechanism of Action:**
* **Tinidazole:** Interferes with DNA synthesis and structure in susceptible anaerobic microorganisms, ultimately leading to cell death.
* **Diloxanide furoate:**  Acts within the intestinal lumen to eradicate amoebae. The precise mechanism is not fully elucidated.
* **Dicyclomine:**  Relaxes smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal tract by inhibiting the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, reducing spasms and pain.
* **Simethicone:** Reduces the surface tension of gas bubbles, allowing them to coalesce and be expelled more easily, relieving bloating and flatulence.


## **Alternate Names**

* Entrogyl Tablet
* Enterozol Tablet
* Tinorid Plus Tablet
* Protorid Forte Tablet

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The combined effect of the four components provides comprehensive management of intestinal amoebiasis and associated symptoms. Tinidazole targets the infectious agent, while diloxanide furoate further aids in the eradication of intraluminal amoebae. Dicyclomine relieves abdominal cramps and spasms, and simethicone addresses gas and bloating.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Tinidazole:** Well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, and primarily excreted by the kidneys.
* **Diloxanide furoate:** Poorly absorbed, acting locally within the gut.
* **Dicyclomine:** Well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver.
* **Simethicone:** Not absorbed systemically; eliminated unchanged in the feces.


**Mode of Action:** As described above, each component has a specific mode of action contributing to the overall therapeutic effect. Tinidazole inhibits DNA synthesis, diloxanide furoate has an unknown luminal amoebicidal action, dicyclomine acts as an anticholinergic agent at muscarinic receptors, and simethicone alters the surface tension of gas bubbles.

**Elimination Pathways:** Tinidazole is primarily excreted renally, diloxanide furoate is eliminated in the feces, dicyclomine is metabolized in the liver, and simethicone is excreted unchanged in the feces.
