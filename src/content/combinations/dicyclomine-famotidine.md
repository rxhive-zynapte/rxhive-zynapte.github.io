## **Usage**

This combination is not typically prescribed together as a single formulation.  Dicyclomine and Famotidine are often prescribed separately to address different aspects of gastrointestinal disorders.

* **Dicyclomine:**  Prescribed to treat the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It helps reduce the symptoms of stomach and intestinal cramping.
* **Famotidine:**  Used to treat and prevent ulcers in the stomach and intestines.  It can also treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and other conditions where the stomach produces too much acid, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.

* **Dicyclomine pharmacological classification:** Anticholinergic, Antispasmodic
* **Famotidine pharmacological classification:** H2 receptor antagonist (H2 blocker)

* **Dicyclomine mechanism of action:** Slows the natural movements of the gut and relaxes the muscles in the stomach and intestines by blocking acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors.
* **Famotidine mechanism of action:** Decreases stomach acid production by blocking histamine at H2 receptors in the stomach lining.

## **Alternate Names**

**Dicyclomine:**
* **Other Names:** Dicycloverine Hydrochloride
* **Brand Names:** Bentyl, Byclomine, Dibent, Di-Spaz, Dicyclocot

**Famotidine:**
* **Brand names:** Pepcid, Pepcid AC, Zantac 360 (Note: Zantac originally referred to Ranitidine, a different H2 blocker, but some formulations now contain Famotidine)


## **How It Works**

**Dicyclomine:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Relaxes smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal tract, reducing spasms and cramping.
* **Pharmacokinetics:**
    * **Absorption:** Well-absorbed orally.
    * **Metabolism:**  Primarily hepatic.
    * **Elimination:** Renal excretion.

* **Mode of Action:**  Antagonist at muscarinic M1, M2, and M3 receptors. Also exhibits antihistaminic and local anesthetic properties.  Reduces gut motility.
* **Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion


**Famotidine:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Inhibits gastric acid secretion.
* **Pharmacokinetics:**
    * **Absorption:** Incompletely absorbed orally.
    * **Metabolism:** Limited hepatic metabolism.
    * **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion, some in feces.
* **Mode of Action:**  Competitive inhibition of histamine at H2 receptors of gastric parietal cells. Suppresses basal and nocturnal gastric acid secretion stimulated by food, caffeine, insulin, betazole, and pentagastrin.
* **Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion, small amount in the feces.



## **Dosage**

Since these drugs are not typically combined into a single product, they are dosed separately as indicated below.

**Dicyclomine**
