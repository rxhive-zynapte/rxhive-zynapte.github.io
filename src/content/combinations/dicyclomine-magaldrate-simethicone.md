## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of gastrointestinal discomfort, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (to relieve abdominal pain, cramping, and bloating), dyspepsia (indigestion) (to manage symptoms like heartburn, bloating, and nausea), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (to reduce heartburn and acid reflux), peptic ulcers (to provide pain relief and support healing—in conjunction with other medications), and flatulence (to reduce excessive gas and bloating).

Its pharmacological classifications are: dicyclomine: anticholinergic, antispasmodic; magaldrate: antacid; and simethicone: anti-foaming agent.

The mechanism of action involves dicyclomine relaxing smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal tract by blocking acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, thereby reducing spasms and cramping; magaldrate neutralizing excess stomach acid, providing relief from heartburn and acid indigestion; and simethicone reducing the surface tension of gas bubbles in the digestive system, allowing them to coalesce and be expelled more easily.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication may be available under various brand names.  Some examples are Magnate D Suspension, Magnate P Paediatric Suspension, Spascrom D Tablet, and Speucid Forte Tablet. No widely recognized international non-proprietary name (INN) exists for this specific combination.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Dicyclomine acts as an antispasmodic, reducing gastrointestinal motility and spasms. Magaldrate neutralizes gastric acid, relieving heartburn and indigestion. Simethicone reduces gas bubble surface tension, facilitating their passage.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Dicyclomine is well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, and primarily excreted in urine. Magaldrate acts locally in the GI tract and is not significantly absorbed. Simethicone is not absorbed and is eliminated in feces.

**Mode of Action:** Dicyclomine competitively inhibits the actions of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, particularly in the GI tract.  Magaldrate reacts chemically with gastric acid, forming magnesium and aluminum chloride salts and water. Simethicone alters the surface tension of gas bubbles, allowing them to combine.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Dicyclomine acts as a muscarinic receptor antagonist. Magaldrate does not involve receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation. Simethicone does not interact with receptors, enzymes, or neurotransmitters.

**Elimination Pathways:** Dicyclomine is primarily eliminated via renal excretion.  Magaldrate, largely unabsorbed, is eliminated in the feces. Simethicone is excreted unchanged in the feces.

## **Dosage**

Dosage information for this specific combination (Dicyclomine + Magaldrate + Simethicone *without* Oxethazaine) is limited. Dosage guidelines are primarily available for combinations including oxethazaine, and these should not be considered interchangeable.  Consult a physician for appropriate dosing.


### **Standard Dosage**

Due to the lack of specific dosing information for this combination, providing standard dosage guidelines is not possible.  Consult a physician or refer to the specific product information for appropriate dosing.  


#### **Adults:**

Consult a physician.


#### **Children:**

Consult a physician. Pediatric dosing for this specific combination is not well-defined, and use in children should be under strict medical supervision.

#### **Special Cases:**

Consult a physician for dose adjustments in elderly patients, patients with renal/hepatic impairment, and those with comorbid conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical settings (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, emergency situations) for this specific drug combination are not available. Dosage must be determined on a case-by-case basis by a physician, considering the patient's condition and other factors.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications based on patient-specific factors (renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms) should be determined by a physician.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Dry mouth, dizziness, drowsiness, blurred vision, nausea, constipation.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Angioedema, apnea, confusion, memory problems, hallucinations.


### **Long-Term Effects**

Limited information. Prolonged antacid use may cause electrolyte imbalances and rebound acidity. Chronic anticholinergic use may lead to cognitive impairment.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Any unusual or severe reaction should be reported immediately.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any component; gastrointestinal obstruction; severe ulcerative colitis; toxic megacolon; unstable cardiovascular status; severe myasthenia gravis; glaucoma (especially angle-closure); obstructive uropathy.

## **Drug Interactions**

Antacids can affect drug absorption; take other medications 1–2 hours apart. Avoid alcohol. Anticholinergics may exacerbate anticholinergic effects. CNS depressants may increase drowsiness. Drugs affecting GI motility may antagonize dicyclomine.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult a physician before use. Safety is not fully established.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

Refer to individual sections for this information, as a specific profile summary for this combination is not readily available. Dosage, monitoring parameters, and other aspects should be determined in consultation with a physician based on individual patient needs.

## **Popular Combinations**

Information specific to common combinations with this formulation is limited. This combination itself is intended to address multiple aspects of gastrointestinal discomfort.

## **Precautions**

General precautions: pre-screening for allergies, metabolic disorders, organ dysfunction. Specific populations: consult a physician for pregnancy/breastfeeding, children/elderly use, and other special cases. Lifestyle: avoid alcohol, and consider driving restrictions.
