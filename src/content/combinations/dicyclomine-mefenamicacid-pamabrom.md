## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation), including menstrual cramps, bloating, and abdominal discomfort.  It is also used to treat other colicky pain, such as intestinal, biliary, and ureteric colic.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Dicyclomine: Anticholinergic, Antispasmodic
* Mefenamic Acid: Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID), Analgesic
* Pamabrom: Diuretic

**Mechanism of Action:**  This combination targets menstrual discomfort through multiple pathways. Dicyclomine relaxes the smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal tract, reducing spasms and cramps. Mefenamic acid inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, thereby decreasing pain and inflammation. Pamabrom, a mild diuretic, helps reduce water retention and bloating.


## **Alternate Names**

Some alternate names for this combination include Pamaspas Plus, Mefbrom Spas, Twagic Spas, MEFTAL-SPAS, and MEFTAL-SPAS DS. Several brand names exist for this drug combination depending on the manufacturer and region.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Dicyclomine:** Acts as an anticholinergic agent, blocking the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors in the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract.  This leads to relaxation of the muscles and reduced spasms.
* **Mefenamic Acid:** Inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, responsible for prostaglandin synthesis.  Prostaglandins contribute to pain, inflammation, and fever. By reducing prostaglandin levels, mefenamic acid alleviates pain and inflammation.
* **Pamabrom:** Acts as a mild diuretic, increasing urine production and reducing water retention.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Dicyclomine:** Well absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, and excreted in the urine and feces.
* **Mefenamic Acid:** Rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 2-4 hours.  It is highly protein-bound and undergoes hepatic metabolism, with metabolites primarily excreted in the urine.
* **Pamabrom:** Absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and excreted in the urine.

**Mode of Action:**  The combined action of these drugs provides comprehensive relief from menstrual discomfort. Dicyclomine addresses muscle spasms, while mefenamic acid reduces pain and inflammation, and pamabrom alleviates bloating by reducing water retention.
