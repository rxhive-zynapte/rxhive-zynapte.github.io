## **Usage**

Dicyclomine + Omeprazole is prescribed for the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).  It is also indicated for other gastrointestinal conditions involving spasms and increased acid production.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Dicyclomine: Anticholinergic, Antispasmodic
* Omeprazole: Proton Pump Inhibitor

**Mechanism of Action:**

Dicyclomine relaxes the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract by blocking acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. Omeprazole reduces gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system (proton pump) in the parietal cells of the stomach.


## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for this specific drug combination itself. However, the individual components have various names:
* **Dicyclomine:**  Dicycloverine Hydrochloride, Dicyclomine HCl. Brand name: Bentyl.
* **Omeprazole:** Brand names: Prilosec, Losec, Zegerid


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* Dicyclomine: Relaxes smooth muscles, reduces motility of the GI tract
* Omeprazole: Suppresses gastric acid secretion.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Dicyclomine**: Well-absorbed orally. Time to peak concentration (Tmax): 1-1.5 hours. Metabolized in the liver, primarily excreted in urine.
* **Omeprazole**: Rapidly absorbed.  Extensively metabolized by the liver (CYP2C19 and CYP3A4). Eliminated primarily in the urine.

**Mode of Action:**

Dicyclomine acts as an anticholinergic agent, blocking acetylcholine's effects on muscarinic receptors in the smooth muscle of the GI tract. This leads to decreased muscle tone and reduced spasms.

Omeprazole irreversibly inhibits the H+/K+ ATPase in gastric parietal cells, effectively blocking the final step of acid production.

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**

* Dicyclomine:  Muscarinic receptor antagonist. Also antagonizes bradykinin and histamine.
* Omeprazole: H+/K+ ATPase inhibitor.

**Elimination pathways:**

* Dicyclomine: Primarily renal excretion.
* Omeprazole: Hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Dicyclomine:
Initial: 20 mg orally four times a day.
Maintenance: Up to 40 mg orally four times a day.

Omeprazole: 20–40 mg once daily. Higher doses may be used in certain conditions such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (up to 120mg/day).


#### **Children:**

Dicyclomine is generally not recommended for use in children younger than 6 months old, due to increased risk of serious side effects. When prescribed, dosing is based on the child's weight and age.

Omeprazole dosing in children is weight-based. The usual dose is 0.7–1.4 mg/kg once daily, but this should be determined by a doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Start with lower doses due to increased sensitivity to anticholinergic effects. Monitor closely.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be needed.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Reduce dosage.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized dosing is necessary.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This drug combination is not typically used in the clinical settings you listed (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, emergency situations).


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications should be based on individual patient characteristics (age, renal/hepatic function, other medical conditions) and response to treatment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Dry mouth
* Blurred vision
* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Headache



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (angioedema, anaphylaxis)
* Urinary retention
* Worsening of glaucoma
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Confusion, hallucinations (especially in elderly)


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term use of omeprazole might be associated with an increased risk of certain infections (e.g. *Clostridium difficile*) and fractures.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any severe allergic reactions, signs of anticholinergic toxicity (confusion, hallucinations, dilated pupils, rapid heart rate, difficulty breathing), or signs of liver problems (jaundice, dark urine) requires immediate intervention.




## **Contraindications**
