## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, and discomfort associated with conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), intestinal colic, biliary colic, renal colic, and spasmodic dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation).  It is also used to relieve symptoms of trapped gas.
- **Pharmacological Classifications:**  Antispasmodic, analgesic, antipyretic, antiflatulent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination works through the synergistic actions of its components. Dicyclomine, an anticholinergic/antispasmodic, relaxes smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal tract by blocking acetylcholine's action. Paracetamol acts as an analgesic and antipyretic by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Simethicone, an anti-foaming agent, reduces gas by breaking down gas bubbles in the gut.

## **Alternate Names**

- While there isn't a universally recognized alternate name for this specific combination, each component has synonyms. Dicyclomine is also known as Dicycloverine. Paracetamol is also known as Acetaminophen. Simethicone may also be called Activated Dimethicone.
- **Brand Names:** Trispas, others (availability varies by region).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dicyclomine acts peripherally to reduce spasms and cramping by inhibiting muscarinic receptors and decreasing smooth muscle motility in the GI tract. Paracetamol's central action reduces pain and fever by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Simethicone alters the surface tension of gas bubbles, allowing them to coalesce and be expelled more readily.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Dicyclomine is well-absorbed orally. Paracetamol is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 30-60 minutes. Simethicone is not absorbed and is eliminated unchanged in the feces.
- **Mode of Action:**  Dicyclomine acts as an anticholinergic, competitively inhibiting the actions of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. Paracetamol's precise mechanism of action is not fully understood but involves inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the central nervous system, reducing prostaglandin synthesis.  Simethicone, being inert, does not have a pharmacological mode of action.  It works physically by reducing the surface tension of gas bubbles.
- **Elimination:** Dicyclomine is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted via renal and biliary pathways. Paracetamol is extensively metabolized in the liver, and metabolites are excreted in the urine. Simethicone is not absorbed and is excreted unchanged in the feces.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One tablet/capsule (containing Dicyclomine 10-20 mg, Paracetamol 500 mg, and Simethicone 40-80 mg) three to four times daily, taken orally 30-60 minutes before meals.


#### **Children:**

Dosing for children below 12 years old should be determined by a pediatrician and is based on the child's age and weight. Safety and efficacy have not been established for children under 6 months.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses due to potential for increased sensitivity to anticholinergic effects. Close monitoring is recommended.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be required based on the degree of impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with glaucoma, urinary retention, prostatic hypertrophy, myasthenia gravis, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, and obstructive gastrointestinal disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of this combination in settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, and the ICU is generally not indicated, as its primary benefit lies in relieving gastrointestinal symptoms like pain and bloating.  In emergency situations, it does not have a role.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are crucial in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and those with comorbid conditions. Always consider patient-specific factors, including drug interactions and potential for adverse effects.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Dry mouth, blurred vision, dizziness, drowsiness, constipation, nausea, urinary hesitancy.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), difficulty breathing, confusion, hallucinations, rapid or irregular heartbeat, urinary retention.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic use of paracetamol can lead to hepatotoxicity.  Long-term use of dicyclomine can lead to tolerance.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis,  acute angle-closure glaucoma, paralytic ileus.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication.
- Glaucoma (especially angle-closure).
- Obstructive gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., pyloric stenosis, paralytic ileus).
- Myasthenia gravis.
- Severe ulcerative colitis.
- Toxic megacolon.
- Obstructive uropathy.
- Infants under 6 months of age.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Anticholinergic agents (additive effects).
- Amantadine (additive effects).
- Tricyclic antidepressants (additive anticholinergic effects).
- Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) (additive anticholinergic effects).
- Antihistamines (additive anticholinergic effects).
- Antipsychotics (additive anticholinergic effects).
- Benzodiazepines (increased sedation).
- Quinidine (additive anticholinergic effects).
- Antacids (reduced dicyclomine absorption).
- Alcohol (increased drowsiness).
- Metoclopramide (decreased efficacy of metoclopramide).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Dicyclomine should be used with caution during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk. Paracetamol is generally considered safe. Simethicone is not systemically absorbed and is unlikely to pose a risk.
- **Breastfeeding:** Dicyclomine is contraindicated during breastfeeding as it may be excreted in breast milk.  Paracetamol can be used while breastfeeding.  Simethicone is unlikely to be present in breast milk.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Dicyclomine: Anticholinergic/antispasmodic, Paracetamol: Analgesic/antipyretic, Simethicone: Antiflatulent.
- **Side Effects:** Dry mouth, blurred vision, dizziness, drowsiness, constipation; rarely, allergic reactions, urinary retention.
- **Contraindications:** Glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, obstructive GI disorders, paralytic ileus, infants under 6 months.
- **Drug Interactions:** Other anticholinergics, amantadine, antidepressants, antihistamines, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, quinidine, antacids, alcohol.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Dicyclomine should be avoided; paracetamol is generally safe; simethicone is unlikely to pose a risk.

## **Popular Combinations**

Dicyclomine is often combined with other medications for synergistic effects. For example, it is sometimes combined with mefenamic acid for period pain.  The current combination, with paracetamol and simethicone, addresses both pain and gas.


## **Precautions**
