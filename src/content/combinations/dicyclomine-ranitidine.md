## **Usage**

Dicyclomine + Ranitidine is prescribed for the relief of abdominal pain and discomfort associated with gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcers, and functional dyspepsia.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Dicyclomine: Anticholinergic/antispasmodic
* Ranitidine: H2 receptor antagonist

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination medication works through two distinct mechanisms:

* Dicyclomine relaxes the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract, reducing spasms and cramps. It achieves this by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter responsible for muscle contraction.
* Ranitidine decreases the production of stomach acid by blocking histamine H2 receptors in the stomach lining. This helps to relieve heartburn, acid reflux, and promotes the healing of ulcers.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for the combination product itself. However, the individual components are known by their generic names (dicyclomine hydrochloride and ranitidine) and various brand names.

**Brand Names:**  A commonly marketed brand name for this drug combination was *Zanocin*. However, this is no longer available as ranitidine has been withdrawn from the market in many countries due to safety concerns.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* Dicyclomine: Relaxes smooth muscle in the GI tract by blocking the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors.
* Ranitidine: Reduces gastric acid secretion by blocking histamine H2 receptors on parietal cells.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* Dicyclomine: Well absorbed orally. Metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted mainly in urine.
* Ranitidine: Absorbed rapidly after oral administration. Undergoes some hepatic metabolism but primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.


**Mode of Action:**

* Dicyclomine acts as a competitive antagonist at muscarinic receptors, preventing acetylcholine from binding and triggering muscle contraction.
* Ranitidine competitively inhibits the binding of histamine to H2 receptors on parietal cells, reducing the activation of adenylate cyclase and consequently, gastric acid secretion.

**Elimination Pathways:**

* Dicyclomine: Primarily hepatic metabolism, with subsequent renal excretion.
* Ranitidine: Primarily renal excretion, with some hepatic metabolism.
