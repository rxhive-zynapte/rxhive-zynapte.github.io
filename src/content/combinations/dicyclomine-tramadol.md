## **Usage**

- Dicyclomine + Tramadol is prescribed for the management of moderate to severe acute pain, particularly pain associated with gastrointestinal spasms or cramps, such as in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other functional bowel disorders.  It can also be used for other types of acute pain as well.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Analgesic, Antispasmodic. Tramadol is an opioid analgesic, Paracetamol is a non-opioid analgesic and antipyretic, and dicyclomine is an anticholinergic antispasmodic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Tramadol acts on opioid receptors in the central nervous system, reducing pain perception. It also inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, further contributing to analgesia.  Paracetamol inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, reducing pain and fever. Dicyclomine relaxes smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal tract by blocking acetylcholine, relieving spasms and cramps.


## **Alternate Names**

- No internationally recognized non-proprietary name exists for this specific combination, as it is composed of three separate active ingredients. 
- **Brand Names:**  Numerous brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region. Some examples based on Indian pharmaceutical market include Proxywel Spas Plus (which contains paracetamol in addition to dicyclomine and tramadol) and numerous other brand names exist for similar combination products with slight variations in ingredients and strengths. (Please note that brand names can change frequently.  Consulting a current pharmaceutical directory is essential for the latest information).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dicyclomine exerts its antispasmodic effects by blocking the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors in the smooth muscle of the GI tract. Tramadol acts as a centrally acting analgesic, primarily through its action on mu-opioid receptors, and also inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.  Paracetamol's mechanism is thought to involve central inhibition of COX enzymes as well as other mechanisms, leading to reduced pain and fever.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Dicyclomine is well-absorbed orally. Tramadol is also well-absorbed after oral administration. Metabolism occurs primarily in the liver, with both drugs being metabolized by CYP enzymes, primarily CYP2D6 for tramadol and CYP3A4 for dicyclomine.  Both drugs are primarily excreted in the urine.  Paracetamol is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is primarily metabolized in the liver via conjugation with glucuronide and sulfate, and a small amount undergoes oxidative metabolism by CYP enzymes. Paracetamol is excreted primarily in the urine.
- **Mode of Action:**  Dicyclomine competitively inhibits muscarinic receptors. Tramadol binds to mu-opioid receptors, modulating pain pathways in the CNS. It also blocks norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake. Paracetamol's exact mode of action is debated, but likely involves COX inhibition and TRPA1 receptor modulation, acting centrally to modulate pain perception.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Dicyclomine is mainly excreted in the urine, both as the unchanged drug and metabolites. Tramadol is extensively metabolized in the liver, mostly through O-demethylation and N-demethylation and glucuronidation or sulfation, and eliminated primarily in the urine.  Paracetamol is largely conjugated in the liver and excreted in the urine, primarily as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

-  A common dosage form contains 10 mg dicyclomine, 325 mg paracetamol, and 50 mg of tramadol.  One tablet is taken every 4-6 hours as needed for pain.  Dosage should be individualized based on pain severity and patient response.   Maximum daily doses should be considered for each individual drug (e.g. 4000 mg for paracetamol).


#### **Children:**

- This combination is generally not recommended for children under 12 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric populations, and the combination of an opioid (tramadol) and an anticholinergic (dicyclomine) can have unpredictable effects on children. Alternative pain management strategies are preferred for this age group.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Lower starting doses may be necessary in elderly patients, along with careful monitoring for adverse effects due to potential age-related decrease in drug clearance and increased sensitivity.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are necessary based on the degree of renal impairment.  Caution should be exercised due to the potential accumulation of both drugs and/or their metabolites.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction or avoidance may be necessary as both dicyclomine and tramadol are metabolized in the liver.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration is necessary in patients with conditions like glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, urinary retention, severe respiratory conditions, asthma, or a history of seizures, where the drugs’ effects may be exacerbated.



### **Clinical Use Cases**


- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, Emergency Situations**: The combination of dicyclomine and tramadol is typically not used in these settings.  These situations often require specific pain management approaches tailored to the individual patient's needs and the clinical context. Tramadol alone may be used in some cases, but careful monitoring for respiratory depression and other side effects is essential. Dicyclomine is not generally used in these settings.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments are made based on the patient's response to therapy, renal and hepatic function, age, and other comorbidities. For patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, dose reductions may be required. Drug interactions with other medications must be considered.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Constipation
- Dry mouth
- Dizziness
- Drowsiness
- Blurred Vision


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Seizures
- Serotonin syndrome
- Respiratory depression
- Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
- Hepatotoxicity (especially with paracetamol overdose)


### **Long-Term Effects**
- Dependence and tolerance (with chronic tramadol use)
- Cognitive impairment (with chronic tramadol use)


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
- Any severe manifestation of the above-mentioned side effects requires urgent medical attention.  QT interval prolongation with tramadol.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication
- Severe respiratory depression
- Acute or severe asthma
- Paralytic ileus
- Severe hepatic impairment
- Concurrent use of MAO inhibitors


## **Drug Interactions**
