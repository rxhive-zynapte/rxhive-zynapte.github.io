This combination, while theoretically possible, is **not recommended** in clinical practice. The recommended combination for HIV treatment includes Efavirenz + Lamivudine + Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate.  Co-administration of this combination with Didanosine is not recommended due to significant increase in Didanosine exposure when combined with Tenofovir, leading to a higher risk of pancreatitis and lactic acidosis.  This document will therefore focus on the recommended combination of Efavirenz + Lamivudine + Tenofovir.

## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** This fixed-dose combination (FDC) medication is prescribed for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and children (weight dependent). It is used as a complete antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen. Note that this medication does not cure HIV, nor does it prevent transmission.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antiretroviral (includes nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)).

- **Mechanism of Action:** This FDC combines three antiretrovirals that work together to inhibit HIV replication.  Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and Lamivudine are NRTIs that interfere with the reverse transcription of viral RNA into DNA. Efavirenz is an NNRTI that directly inhibits the reverse transcriptase enzyme. This multifaceted approach targets multiple steps in the viral life cycle.



## **Alternate Names**

This combination is available under the brand names Symfi (600 mg/300 mg/300 mg) and Symfi Lo (400 mg/300 mg/300 mg), with variations in the Efavirenz component.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  The combination suppresses HIV replication by inhibiting reverse transcriptase, preventing the formation of proviral DNA.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Administered orally, ideally on an empty stomach and at bedtime to mitigate side effects.
    - **Metabolism:** Efavirenz is primarily metabolized by the CYP450 system, specifically CYP2B6, with minor contributions from CYP3A4 and CYP2A6. Lamivudine and Tenofovir are minimally metabolized.
    - **Elimination:** Lamivudine and Tenofovir are primarily renally excreted. Efavirenz metabolites are primarily excreted in feces, with a small amount in urine.

- **Mode of Action:** Tenofovir and Lamivudine, after intracellular phosphorylation, compete with natural nucleosides, incorporating into the viral DNA chain, causing chain termination. Efavirenz directly binds to reverse transcriptase at a site distinct from NRTIs, causing allosteric inhibition.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Symfi Lo: For patients weighing 35 kg or more, one tablet (400 mg efavirenz/300 mg lamivudine/300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) orally once daily at bedtime.  Symfi: For patients weighing 40 kg or more, one tablet (600 mg efavirenz/300 mg lamivudine/300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) orally once daily at bedtime.

#### **Children:** Symfi and Symfi Lo are not indicated for children weighing less than 35kg and 40kg respectively. Dosing adjustments may be required in children weighing 35kg/40kg and above based on weight bands. Efavirenz dosing may also be based on CYP2B6 genotype in children over 3 months old.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Exercise caution due to potential age-related decreases in hepatic, renal, or cardiac function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 50 mL/min or end-stage renal disease.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Not recommended for moderate to severe hepatic impairment. Use with caution in mild hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Close monitoring is necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  
The dosage remains consistent across various clinical settings, as described in the standard adult dosage.

### **Dosage Adjustments**  
Adjustments are primarily based on renal and hepatic function as outlined above.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:** Rash, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, insomnia, abnormal dreams, depression, anxiety.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**  Lactic acidosis, severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, pancreatitis, renal impairment including Fanconi syndrome, severe skin reactions, suicidal ideation.

### **Long-Term Effects:**  Changes in bone mineral density, kidney problems, fat redistribution.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication.
- Coadministration with drugs that significantly interact with efavirenz, lamivudine, or tenofovir, such as elbasvir/grazoprevir and voriconazole.
- Severe hepatic impairment.

## **Drug Interactions**

Numerous drug interactions exist. Refer to a comprehensive drug interaction resource for a complete list. Significant interactions can occur with certain anticonvulsants, antifungals, antimycobacterials, and some herbal supplements.  CYP450 enzyme inducers or inhibitors may affect Efavirenz metabolism.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Breastfeeding is not recommended while on this medication due to the potential for infant exposure and unknown effects. Use during pregnancy requires careful consideration of the risks and benefits, as efavirenz has been associated with birth defects in animal studies.  Close monitoring is necessary.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

Refer to the sections above for detailed explanations of the mechanism of action, side effects, contraindications, drug interactions, pregnancy/breastfeeding considerations, and dosage.  

- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Renal function (creatinine, phosphorus, urine glucose, urine protein), liver function tests, HIV viral load, CD4 count, bone mineral density.

## **Popular Combinations**
This FDC is intended as a complete regimen and should not be combined with other antiretrovirals without specialist consultation.


## **Precautions**

- Pre-screening for HBV is essential.
- Monitor renal and hepatic function closely.
- Assess for mental health issues.
- Counsel patients about potential side effects, including neuropsychiatric symptoms.
- Advise patients about drug interactions and the importance of adherence.
