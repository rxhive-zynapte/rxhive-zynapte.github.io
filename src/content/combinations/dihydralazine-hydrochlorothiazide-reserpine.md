## **Usage**

- This drug combination is primarily prescribed for **essential hypertension** (high blood pressure).  It was also previously used to treat severe agitation in patients with mental disorders, but these uses are much less common. (Note: Reserpine, a component of this combination, is no longer readily available in the US).
- **Pharmacological Classification**: Antihypertensive (a combination of a vasodilator, thiazide diuretic, and central sympatholytic).
- **Mechanism of Action**: This combination lowers blood pressure through multiple mechanisms:
    - **Dihydralazine**: Directly relaxes vascular smooth muscle, causing vasodilation and reducing peripheral vascular resistance.
    - **Hydrochlorothiazide**: Increases the excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys, reducing blood volume and lowering blood pressure. It also has some direct vasodilatory effects.
    - **Reserpine**: Depletes norepinephrine stores in peripheral nerve endings, reducing sympathetic nervous system activity, which leads to vasodilation and decreased heart rate.

## **Alternate Names**

- No commonly used alternate generic names exist.
- Brand names (many are discontinued, especially those containing reserpine): Ser-Ap-Es, Serathide, Serpazide, Serpex, Hydrap-ES, Marpres, Unipres, and others.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**:
    - Dihydralazine's primary effect is direct arterial vasodilation. This can lead to reflex tachycardia.
    - Hydrochlorothiazide causes diuresis and has some vasodilatory effects. It can cause electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hyponatremia).
    - Reserpine depletes catecholamines, leading to decreased sympathetic tone, reduced heart rate, and vasodilation.  It can cause sedation, depression, and nasal congestion.
- **Pharmacokinetics**:
    - All three drugs are absorbed orally, but bioavailability varies.
    - Metabolism: Dihydralazine undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism via acetylation (genetic polymorphism influences metabolism); Hydrochlorothiazide is not extensively metabolized; Reserpine undergoes significant hepatic metabolism.
    - Elimination: Metabolites of all three drugs are primarily excreted renally.
- **Mode of Action**:
    - Dihydralazine likely acts by increasing intracellular cGMP, which leads to smooth muscle relaxation.
    - Hydrochlorothiazide inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron.
    - Reserpine inhibits the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT), which transports norepinephrine into storage vesicles in presynaptic nerve terminals.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**
#### **Adults**:
- Initial dose: Typically one tablet daily, containing a standard combination like reserpine 0.1 mg, hydralazine 25 mg, and hydrochlorothiazide 15 mg.
- Maintenance dose: Titrated based on patient response up to 2 tablets per day (or equivalent doses of the individual components), divided into two doses. Note: Exceeding 0.25 mg/day of reserpine is not recommended.
#### **Children**: No established standard dosing exists for this combination in children; using it in pediatric patients is not routinely recommended.
#### **Special Cases**:
- **Elderly Patients**: Start at lower doses and titrate cautiously due to increased sensitivity to side effects (e.g., dizziness, hypotension).
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Hydrochlorothiazide is less effective with creatinine clearance <25 mL/min. Caution and dose reduction are advised.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Caution is advised due to the hepatic metabolism of the drugs. Close monitoring is necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Patients with coronary artery disease, lupus erythematosus, peptic ulcer disease, ulcerative colitis, gout, diabetes mellitus, and asthma need individualized dosage adjustments and careful monitoring.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  
This fixed-dose combination is not typically recommended for acute clinical situations such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergencies. Individual agents may be utilized if appropriate.

### **Dosage Adjustments**  
Dosage titration is required based on individual blood pressure response. Renal/hepatic dysfunction and other comorbid conditions necessitate specific dose adjustments.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**: Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, fatigue, nasal congestion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, depression, nightmares, anxiety.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**: Heart failure, orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, syncope, angioedema, blood dyscrasias, lupus-like syndrome, severe depression, suicidal ideation.


### **Long-Term Effects**:  Electrolyte imbalances, gout, lupus-like syndrome.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**: Allergic reactions (rash, pruritus, angioedema), hepatotoxicity, blood dyscrasias, severe hypotension.

## **Contraindications**
- Hypersensitivity to any component, anuria, depression (especially with reserpine), lupus erythematosus, aortic stenosis, constrictive pericarditis, AV block.

## **Drug Interactions**

- **Dihydralazine**: Interacts with MAO inhibitors, beta-blockers (can exacerbate heart failure), NSAIDs (reduce antihypertensive effect), nitrates.
- **Hydrochlorothiazide**: Interacts with other antihypertensives (additive effect), digoxin (hypokalemia increases digoxin toxicity), lithium, corticosteroids (hypokalemia), NSAIDs.
- **Reserpine**: Interacts with MAO inhibitors (hypertensive crisis), tricyclic antidepressants, digitalis glycosides, sympathomimetics.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category**: C (for the combination)  Individual agents have different risk profiles.
- Fetal risks: Reserpine has shown teratogenicity in animals.  Thiazides can cause fetal thrombocytopenia and electrolyte disturbances. Dihydralazine can cause fetal distress. Use only if benefit clearly outweighs risk.
- Breastfeeding: All three drugs are excreted in breast milk.  Reserpine can cause nasal congestion and lethargy in infants.  Hydrochlorothiazide can suppress lactation. Use alternative medications if possible.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** See above.
- **Side Effects:** See above.
- **Contraindications:** See above.
- **Drug Interactions:** See above.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Not recommended unless absolutely necessary.
- **Dosage:** See above.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, heart rate, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), renal function, signs of heart failure, mental status (with reserpine).

## **Popular Combinations**

Historically, this fixed-dose combination has been used on its own. However, current practice often favors using individual agents titrated to optimal response.

## **Precautions**
- Monitor for side effects, especially in elderly patients.
- Electrolyte monitoring is important, especially potassium levels.
- Psychiatric monitoring may be necessary with reserpine.
- Caution in patients with heart failure, renal/hepatic impairment, diabetes.
- Avoid abrupt discontinuation.
