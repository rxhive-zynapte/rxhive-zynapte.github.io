## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the treatment of diarrhea and dysentery, especially caused by *Entamoeba histolytica* (amoebiasis) and *Giardia lamblia* (giardiasis). It's effective against both intestinal and extraintestinal amoebiasis.  It can also be used for other parasitic infections in the gastrointestinal tract.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antiprotozoal, Antibacterial, Anti-flatulent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Metronidazole acts as an antibiotic and antiprotozoal agent, disrupting DNA synthesis in anaerobic bacteria and protozoa. Diloxanide furoate is an amoebicide targeting *Entamoeba histolytica* trophozoites in the intestine. Dimethicone, an anti-flatulent, reduces the surface tension of gas bubbles, aiding their expulsion and relieving bloating.

## **Alternate Names**

- Diloxanide furoate + Metronidazole + Dimethicone.
- **Brand Names:**  Mylone. Several other brand names exist depending on the manufacturer.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Metronidazole disrupts DNA synthesis in anaerobic microorganisms. Diloxanide acts within the intestinal lumen to eliminate amoebas. Dimethicone reduces gas bubble surface tension, facilitating their expulsion and relieving bloating.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - *Metronidazole:* Well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, excreted in urine and feces.
    - *Diloxanide furoate:* Absorbed from the GI tract, hydrolyzed to diloxanide, conjugated, and excreted in urine.
    - *Dimethicone:* Not systemically absorbed; acts locally in the GI tract and is eliminated in feces.
- **Mode of Action:** Metronidazole inhibits DNA synthesis. Diloxanide's exact mechanism is unclear but it is directly amoebicidal. Dimethicone is not absorbed; it works locally in the gut lumen to reduce gas formation and aid expulsion.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal for metronidazole and diloxanide; dimethicone is eliminated in feces.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** One tablet (containing 200-400 mg metronidazole, 250-500 mg diloxanide furoate, and 100 mg dimethicone) three times daily for 5-10 days.

#### **Children:** Dosage should be determined by a pediatrician based on weight or age. A common recommendation is 20 mg/kg daily of diloxanide, divided into three doses for 10 days.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be needed due to age-related decline in hepatic and renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be needed based on the degree of impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution; dose adjustment may be required, especially in severe liver disease.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider interactions and contraindications with other conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The primary use of this combination is for gastrointestinal infections. There are no standard dosage guidelines for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be necessary based on individual patient factors like renal or hepatic impairment.
