## **Usage**

- This combination medication is prescribed for the treatment of intestinal amoebiasis, a parasitic infection of the intestines caused by *Entamoeba histolytica*. It is effective against both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases.  It also provides relief from gas, bloating, and abdominal discomfort associated with these conditions.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antiamoebic, Antiprotozoal, Antimicrobial, Antiflatulent
- **Mechanism of Action:** Diloxanide furoate acts as a luminal amoebicide, directly targeting amoebae in the intestinal lumen. Ornidazole is a nitroimidazole derivative that disrupts DNA synthesis and protein synthesis in anaerobic bacteria and protozoa. Simethicone is an anti-foaming agent that reduces the surface tension of gas bubbles, aiding their expulsion and relieving bloating.

## **Alternate Names**
- There are no officially recognized alternate names for this specific combination. However, the individual components are sometimes referred to as:
    - Diloxanide furoate: Diloxanide
    - Ornidazole: Ornidazol
    - Simethicone: Activated dimethicone
- **Brand Names:**  Amicline Plus, Amirid, Entrogyl-OZ, Metrogyl Compound Plus


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Diloxanide furoate acts directly on amoebae within the intestinal lumen, exhibiting amoebicidal activity.  Ornidazole, a prodrug, enters the microbial cell where it is reduced to its active form. This active form interacts with the organism's DNA, causing strand breakage, inhibition of DNA repair and ultimately cell death.  Simethicone reduces the surface tension of gas bubbles, facilitating their coalescence and promoting passage. It does not reduce the formation of gas but alleviates its effects.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Diloxanide furoate is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. It is then hydrolyzed to diloxanide, the active form. Ornidazole is also well-absorbed orally. Both diloxanide and ornidazole are metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine.  Simethicone is not absorbed and is eliminated unchanged in the feces.
- **Mode of Action:** Diloxanide's exact mechanism of action is not completely understood, but it appears to act directly on amoebae. Ornidazole interacts with microbial DNA to cause cellular damage. Simethicone physically alters the surface tension of gas bubbles.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Not applicable for this combination. Simethicone works through a physical mechanism and does not involve receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation. The exact mechanism for diloxanide is uncertain. Ornidazole inhibits DNA synthesis.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Diloxanide and Ornidazole are metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily through the kidneys.  Simethicone, being unabsorbed, is eliminated via the feces.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**
#### **Adults:**  One tablet containing Diloxanide furoate 375mg, Ornidazole 250mg, and Simethicone 25mg, taken three times a day, for 10 days.
#### **Children:** For children weighing more than 25 kg, Diloxanide can be given at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight per day, divided into three doses, for 10 days. Ornidazole pediatric dosing needs to be determined based on clinical guidelines.
#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically necessary, but monitor for adverse effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dosage adjustment may be needed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution as both diloxanide and ornidazole are metabolized in the liver.
