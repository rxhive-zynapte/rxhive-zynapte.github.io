## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the treatment of intestinal amoebiasis, a parasitic infection caused by *Entamoeba histolytica*. It is also effective against giardiasis, and sometimes used for amebic liver abscess, trichomoniasis, and bacterial vaginosis.  It addresses not only the infection itself, but also helps alleviate the associated gastrointestinal symptoms like bloating, flatulence, and stomach cramps.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antiprotozoal, Antibiotic, Antiflatulent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Diloxanide furoate acts as a luminal amoebicide, targeting the parasite within the intestinal lumen. Tinidazole, a nitroimidazole antibiotic, disrupts the parasite's DNA, leading to its demise.  Simethicone, an anti-foaming agent, reduces gas bubbles in the GI tract, providing relief from bloating and discomfort.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination.
- **Brand Names:** Tinilox-MPS, Entrogyl, Metrodif MPS (Note: Brand availability may vary regionally.)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Diloxanide furoate exerts its antiamoebic action primarily in the intestinal lumen. Tinidazole exhibits broad-spectrum activity against various protozoa and anaerobic bacteria. Simethicone decreases the surface tension of gas bubbles, aiding their coalescence and expulsion.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Diloxanide furoate is poorly absorbed from the GI tract, which concentrates its action within the intestines. Tinidazole achieves good systemic absorption after oral administration, reaching peak plasma levels in about two hours. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine. Simethicone is not absorbed systemically, and is eliminated unchanged in the feces.
- **Mode of Action:** Diloxanide furoate's precise mode of action is not fully elucidated, but may involve interference with the parasite's energy metabolism. Tinidazole is reduced intracellularly within the microorganism, forming cytotoxic free radicals that damage DNA, thus inhibiting microbial growth. Simethicone acts physically to reduce gas formation and accumulation, without affecting chemical processes.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Diloxanide furoate is mostly excreted unchanged in the feces. Tinidazole is predominantly eliminated via renal excretion, while simethicone passes through the GI tract and is eliminated in the feces.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Tablets: One tablet (Diloxanide 250mg + Tinidazole 300mg + Simethicone 25mg or similar strength) three times daily for 5-10 days.
- Suspension: 5ml containing a proportionated pediatric dose, based on age or weight, three times daily for 5-10 days, or as prescribed by a doctor.

#### **Children:**

- Dosage is weight or age-dependent and should be determined by a physician. Suspension formulations are typically used for children.
- **Pediatric Safety Considerations:** Use with caution in children younger than 3 years.  Close monitoring for adverse effects is crucial.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment might be necessary depending on renal and hepatic function. Start with lower doses and adjust based on clinical response.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Administer with caution. Dose reduction may be necessary based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Administer with caution. Dose adjustment might be needed due to reduced metabolic capacity.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate for potential drug interactions and consider any underlying diseases that could influence drug metabolism or clearance.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources focus primarily on amebiasis and giardiasis treatment. Dosing for other specific clinical situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use is not provided. Dosage recommendations for these cases should be made on a patient-specific basis by the attending physician.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage should be individualized according to the patient's clinical condition, age, weight, and renal/hepatic function.  Therapeutic drug monitoring may be beneficial in certain cases to ensure efficacy and minimize adverse effects.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, dry mouth, metallic taste, dizziness, fatigue, abdominal pain, skin rash.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe skin rash, hives, difficulty breathing, unusual tiredness or weakness, paresthesias, ataxia, seizures, blood dyscrasias, and other hypersensitivity reactions.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term use of tinidazole can lead to peripheral neuropathy.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Serious ADRs require immediate medical attention and may include anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and blood dyscrasias.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any of the components (diloxanide furoate, tinidazole, or simethicone), other nitroimidazole derivatives or any component of the formulation.
- First trimester of pregnancy.
- Patients with active neurological disorders, blood dyscrasias, or severe hepatic impairment.
- History of seizures or other neurological conditions that might be exacerbated by the medication.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Alcohol: Avoid alcohol during therapy and for at least 72 hours after the last dose due to disulfiram-like reactions (flushing, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and palpitations).
- Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin): Enhanced anticoagulant effect. Monitor INR closely and adjust warfarin dose as needed.
- Lithium: Tinidazole can increase lithium levels. Monitor lithium levels and adjust dosage as needed.
- Phenytoin:  Tinidazole may elevate phenytoin levels. Monitor phenytoin serum concentrations and adjust its dosage accordingly.
- Disulfiram: Concurrent use may result in neurotoxicity.
- CYP450 substrates: Tinidazole is a CYP3A4 inhibitor and could affect the metabolism of drugs metabolized by this pathway.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Use only if clearly needed and after careful assessment of the risks and benefits. Avoid use during the first trimester.
- **Breastfeeding:** Tinidazole is excreted in breast milk. Interrupt breastfeeding during therapy and for at least 72 hours after the last dose.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Diloxanide furoate is a luminal amoebicide; Tinidazole damages DNA of microorganisms; Simethicone reduces gas accumulation.
