## **Usage**

Diltiazem + Lidocaine is prescribed for the treatment of anal fissures.  It is also used for hemorrhoids and other anal discomforts. This combination may also be considered, under the guidance of a healthcare professional, for other conditions involving muscle spasms and localized pain, such as with hemorrhoids.

Pharmacologically, Diltiazem is classified as a calcium channel blocker, and Lidocaine is a local anesthetic.  They are usually compounded together for this indication in an ointment or cream.

Diltiazem works by relaxing the smooth muscles in the anal sphincter, reducing resting pressure and improving blood flow to promote healing. Lidocaine provides local pain relief.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no officially recognized alternate names for the combination product. However, it may be referred to as Diltiazem/Lidocaine ointment/cream.

Brand names vary depending on the compounding pharmacy.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, inhibits calcium influx into smooth muscle cells, causing vasodilation and reducing anal sphincter pressure. Lidocaine blocks sodium channels, inhibiting nerve impulse transmission and providing local anesthesia.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Both drugs are absorbed locally. When applied rectally, systemic absorption of Lidocaine is minimal.  Diltiazem, even when applied topically, has the potential for systemic absorption although it would be expected to be much less than orally administered Diltiazem. Diltiazem is primarily metabolized by the liver (CYP3A4 enzyme) and excreted in the urine and feces. Lidocaine is also metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine.


**Mode of Action:** Diltiazem's vasodilatory effect increases blood flow to the anal fissure, promoting healing. Lidocaine's anesthetic action relieves pain and discomfort associated with the fissure.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Diltiazem blocks L-type calcium channels. Lidocaine blocks voltage-gated sodium channels.

**Elimination Pathways:** Diltiazem is primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism (CYP3A4 enzymes) with renal and fecal excretion. Lidocaine is mainly eliminated through hepatic metabolism.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  A pea-sized amount of the ointment is typically applied intra-anally three times a day, often for six weeks, then reduced to once or twice daily for another six weeks. Some sources recommend insertion of the finger at least halfway into the rectum.


#### **Children:** Pediatric dosing should be determined by a healthcare professional based on weight and age. Safety and effectiveness in children have not been formally established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary due to age-related decline in hepatic and renal function. Start with a lower dose and titrate slowly.  Elderly are at greater risk for dizziness and light-headedness and so caution and slow titration of dose is warranted.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Exercise caution. Adjust dose based on the degree of impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Exercise caution. Reduce the dose as Diltiazem is metabolized by the liver.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider underlying cardiovascular conditions and other medications the patient may be taking as interactions are possible.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage and administration for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, and ICU use are not applicable to this combination, as it is intended for topical application for anal fissures.


### **Dosage Adjustments**
Adjustments should be based on individual patient response and tolerance, as well as hepatic and renal function.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**
Local reactions such as itching or burning at the application site, headache, nausea, dizziness, light-headedness


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Severe dizziness, fainting, fast/pounding heartbeat, paleness, sweating, blurred vision, dry mouth, dark urine, bluish lips/skin/nails, unusual tiredness, severe weakness, seizures.

### **Long-Term Effects:**
Data regarding chronic complications from prolonged use is limited.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** As above - contact prescriber immediately if any appear.

## **Contraindications**
Hypersensitivity to diltiazem or lidocaine, severe anemia, recent myocardial infarction or pulmonary congestion, concurrent use of rifampin. Pre-existing medical conditions, especially of the heart or liver, should be discussed with the prescriber.

## **Drug Interactions**

Diltiazem interacts with several medications, including certain antihypertensives, antiarrhythmics, and CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin). Grapefruit juice can increase blood levels. Smoking may reduce the effectiveness of Lidocaine. Beta-blockers and antiarrhythmics can interact with Lidocaine. The interactions may vary depending on the dosage form and route of administration. 

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
Consult with a healthcare professional regarding the use of this medication during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Safety during pregnancy has not been well-established and risks should be carefully considered. Lidocaine appears to be safe while breastfeeding but it is recommended to wait an hour after applying ointment before breastfeeding.
