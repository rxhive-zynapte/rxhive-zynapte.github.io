## **Usage**

Dimethicone + Hydrocortisone is prescribed for the relief of inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, including eczema, atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, and other skin irritations and rashes.  It is a topical corticosteroid combined with a skin protectant.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Anti-inflammatory (corticosteroid), skin protectant.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Hydrocortisone, a corticosteroid, reduces inflammation by binding to glucocorticoid receptors, which inhibits inflammatory pathways, ultimately decreasing swelling, redness, and itching. Dimethicone acts as a barrier, protecting the skin from irritants and helping to retain moisture.



## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication might be referenced by the individual components, hydrocortisone and dimethicone. It doesn't have specific international nonproprietary names (INNs) beyond those. Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Hydrocortisone exerts its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the skin. This leads to the suppression of inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, reducing the inflammatory response. Dimethicone forms a protective barrier, preventing water loss and protecting the skin from further irritation.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Hydrocortisone, when applied topically, is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation. However, absorption can increase with factors like application to large surface areas, prolonged use, or use under occlusive dressings. Dimethicone is not absorbed systemically. Hydrocortisone is metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted in the urine. Dimethicone is not metabolized and is eliminated unchanged.

- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Hydrocortisone exerts its effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a thin film to the affected area two to four times daily.

#### **Children:**

For children 2 years and older, apply to the affected area two to four times daily. Consult a doctor for children under 2 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically necessary but use with caution due to potential for skin thinning. Monitor for systemic absorption.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically necessary.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments may not be necessary, but caution is advised, and monitoring for systemic absorption is crucial.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Patients with conditions like diabetes, Cushing's syndrome, or infections at the application site should use with caution and under close medical supervision.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is not typically indicated for clinical use cases involving intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary use is for the topical management of dermatological conditions.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjust dosage based on the severity of the skin condition and patient response. If symptoms persist or worsen after a few days, consult a physician.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Burning, stinging, itching, dryness, irritation, redness, and skin thinning at the application site.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic contact dermatitis, skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, hypertrichosis, secondary infection. Signs of systemic absorption (e.g., weight gain, moon face, buffalo hump, hyperglycemia) may occur with prolonged use or application over large areas.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, and hypopigmentation may occur with prolonged use, especially with high-potency corticosteroids.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis), adrenal suppression, Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone, dimethicone, or any component of the formulation. Viral, bacterial, or fungal skin infections (unless used in conjunction with appropriate antimicrobial therapy). Tuberculosis of the skin. Rosacea. Perioral dermatitis.


## **Drug Interactions**

No significant drug interactions have been reported with topical application of dimethicone + hydrocortisone. However, inform your physician about all other medications, including topical products, being used.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Use only if clearly needed. Topical application is generally considered low risk, but minimize use and avoid applying to large areas. Consult your doctor before using.
- **Breastfeeding:** Consult your doctor before use. Topical application poses a minimal risk, but avoid applying to the nipple area before breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**
