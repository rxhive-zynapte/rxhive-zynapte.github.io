## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as a skin protectant to treat and prevent minor skin irritations like diaper rash, itching, and dryness. It is also effective against chafed, cracked, chapped, or windburned skin.  It is for topical use only.  It doesn't fall under a single pharmacological classification, but the combined action could be described as emollient, protectant, and adsorbent.  Dimethicone acts as an emollient and barrier, light kaolin absorbs excess oil and moisture, and zinc oxide provides a physical barrier and promotes healing.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for the combination. Brand names include Miradex Cream.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Dimethicone:** Forms a hydrophobic barrier on the skin, reducing water loss and protecting against irritants.  It also acts as a lubricant, reducing friction.
* **Light Kaolin:** Absorbs excess moisture and oils from the skin surface, providing a drying effect without completely dehydrating the skin.
* **Zinc Oxide:** Acts as a physical barrier against irritants, offering additional protection. It also has mild astringent and antiseptic properties.


**Pharmacokinetics:**

Topical application limits systemic absorption of these ingredients. Minimal information exists regarding the specific pharmacokinetics of the combination, as it primarily exerts its effects locally.  The small amount absorbed should be metabolized in the liver and cleared renally or through fecal matter.

**Mode of Action:**
The combination does not have specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation activity. Its mechanism of action involves creating physical and chemical barriers on the skin, absorbing moisture, and promoting a healthy skin environment.  Elimination of the minimal absorbed drug is through both renal and hepatic routes.
