## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of gastrointestinal discomfort caused by excess gastric acid, gas, and associated pain.  Conditions it is used for include:

* Dyspepsia (Indigestion)
* Heartburn
* Acid Indigestion
* Sour Stomach
* Bloating
* Flatulence
* Gastritis
* Peptic Ulcers
* Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)

**Pharmacological Classification:**  This is a combination product containing an antacid, an anti-flatulent, and a local anesthetic.

**Mechanism of Action:** Magaldrate neutralizes excess stomach acid. Simethicone (activated dimethicone) reduces the surface tension of gas bubbles in the GI tract, facilitating their expulsion. Oxetacaine provides local anesthetic action, numbing the lining of the stomach and esophagus to relieve pain.


## **Alternate Names**

There are no officially recognized alternate names for this specific combination drug itself, other than variations in the order of the ingredients (e.g., Oxetacaine + Magaldrate + Dimethicone). However, several brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region, which are discussed later. Dimethicone is also known as activated polydimethylsiloxane and simethicone.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Magaldrate:**  Reacts with hydrochloric acid in the stomach to form aluminum and magnesium chloride, water, and raising the gastric pH.  It has a relatively slow onset but prolonged duration of action. Poorly absorbed systemically.
* **Simethicone:**  A surface-active agent that decreases the surface tension of gas bubbles, allowing them to coalesce into larger bubbles that are easier to expel. Does not prevent gas formation.
* **Oxetacaine:**  A local anesthetic that blocks voltage-gated sodium channels in nerve fibers, inhibiting pain signal transmission from the esophageal and gastric mucosa.  Minimally absorbed systemically.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Magaldrate and oxetacaine are minimally absorbed systemically. Simethicone is not absorbed and is eliminated unchanged in the feces.
* **Metabolism:**  Negligible metabolism for all three components.
* **Elimination:**  Magaldrate is primarily excreted through feces; any absorbed aluminum or magnesium is excreted renally. Simethicone is eliminated unchanged in the feces.  Oxetacaine may undergo some hepatic metabolism with subsequent renal excretion of metabolites.

**Mode of Action:** Described above under pharmacodynamics. There is no known receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation (other than the local effect of oxetacaine on nerve conduction).


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  The typical dose is 1-2 tablespoons (15-30 mL) or 1-4 chewable tablets (depending on formulation) taken 20-60 minutes after meals and at bedtime as needed. Shake the bottle well before each use if using the suspension.

#### **Children:**  Use in children under 12 years of age is generally not recommended due to limited safety and efficacy data. Some sources mention using an appropriate proportion of the adult dose, while others consider the medication unsafe for children. Consult a pediatrician for specific dosing recommendations in special circumstances, if necessary.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are typically required, but monitor renal function and electrolyte levels.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Use with caution as aluminum and magnesium accumulation may occur.  Dose reduction may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific dose adjustments are usually required for oxetacaine, but exercise caution.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider individual patient factors, such as electrolyte imbalances, and other medications being taken, before prescribing.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of this specific combination is not generally indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It is primarily used for symptomatic relief of gastrointestinal discomfort as outlined in the Usage section.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

As mentioned before, dose adjustments are primarily necessary for patients with renal impairment.  Consider drug interactions and comorbid conditions for other potential adjustments.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Intestinal Pain
* Chalky Taste
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Dry mouth
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Severe dizziness or lightheadedness
* Difficulty breathing
* Electrolyte imbalances (with prolonged use or renal impairment)
* Intestinal obstruction (in susceptible individuals)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

* Osteomalacia (with prolonged, high-dose magaldrate use, particularly in patients with low phosphate levels)
* Aluminum toxicity (in patients with renal impairment)


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** The severe adverse effects listed above would warrant immediate intervention.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any of the components.
* Severe renal impairment.
* Intestinal obstruction or ileus.
* Hypophosphatemia.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Antacids (aluminum or magnesium-containing):**  May increase the risk of constipation or diarrhea.
* **Antibiotics (tetracyclines, quinolones):**  Magaldrate can reduce their absorption.
* **Levothyroxine:**  Magaldrate may reduce its absorption.
* **Phenytoin:**  Absorption may be reduced by magaldrate.
* **Alcohol:**  May increase gastric acid production, counteracting the effect of magaldrate.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety:  Consult with a doctor before using during pregnancy.  Safety has not been fully established, and potential risks to the fetus should be weighed against the benefits to the mother.

Breastfeeding: Consult with a doctor before using while breastfeeding. The extent of excretion into breast milk is unknown, and potential effects on the neonate should be considered.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

See information summarized above in the preceding sections.

## **Popular Combinations**

This particular combination is itself a common formulation. Sometimes, domperidone, a prokinetic agent, is added to this combination.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Evaluate renal function, electrolyte levels, and any history of gastrointestinal obstruction before prescribing.
* **Specific Populations:**  See above regarding pregnancy, breastfeeding, children, and the elderly.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Advise patients to avoid alcohol and smoking, maintain a balanced diet, and report any persistent or worsening side effects.
