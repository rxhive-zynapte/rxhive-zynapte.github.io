## **Usage**

Dimethicone + Magaldrate is prescribed for the relief of symptoms associated with gas, bloating, indigestion, heartburn, and stomach upset, including acid indigestion, sour stomach, and peptic ulcers.  It is also used to treat hyperphosphatemia and magnesium deficiency. It falls under the pharmacological classifications of antacid and antiflatulent.

The mechanism of action involves two components: Magaldrate, an antacid, neutralizes excess stomach acid. Dimethicone, an anti-flatulent, reduces the surface tension of gas bubbles, facilitating their expulsion and preventing further accumulation in the digestive tract.

## **Alternate Names**

Simethicone is sometimes referred to as activated dimethicone. Brand names include Riopan Plus, Ron Acid Plus, Rantac MPS Syrup, and Siloxine Suspension, among others.  Many regional and generic formulations exist.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Magaldrate increases gastric pH by neutralizing hydrochloric acid.  Dimethicone disperses and prevents the formation of mucus-surrounded gas pockets in the gastrointestinal tract.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Magaldrate is not systemically absorbed and acts locally in the GI tract.  It is eliminated through feces.  Dimethicone is also not absorbed and is excreted unchanged in the feces.

**Mode of Action:** Magaldrate chemically neutralizes stomach acid through a reaction with hydrochloric acid.  Dimethicone alters the surface tension of gas bubbles, causing them to coalesce and be more easily expelled.  There is no receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation involved with this combination.

**Elimination:** Primarily via fecal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

5-10 mL (1-2 teaspoonfuls or 540-1080 mg of Magaldrate) taken orally 20 minutes to 1 hour after meals and at bedtime, or as needed. The maximum dose is 80 mL (16 teaspoonfuls) within a 24-hour period.

#### **Children:**

Safety and efficacy have not been established for children younger than 12 years. For children over 12 years, an appropriate proportion of the adult dose can be used, but not to exceed 5 mL three times a day for those under 5. Dosing should be based on the child's age and weight and guided by a healthcare professional.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** The standard adult dose is generally appropriate, but dose adjustments may be necessary depending on renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised, and dose reduction may be needed due to the magnesium component.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments are typically required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution should be used in patients with Alzheimer's disease, colostomy, or ileostomy.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage for specific clinical situations is not routinely adjusted for this medication. It is typically given as needed for symptom relief in various settings, including during hospitalization, intubation, surgical recovery, mechanical ventilation, or ICU care.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be required based on individual patient response and tolerance.  Particular attention should be given to renal function.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Constipation, diarrhea, intestinal pain, chalky taste, nausea, and vomiting are common side effects.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Aluminum intoxication, hypermagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, osteomalacia, and allergic reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Prolonged use may lead to hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions requiring urgent medical intervention.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any component, severe renal impairment, bowel obstruction, abdominal pain of unknown origin.

## **Drug Interactions**

May interact with various medications, including statins, certain antibiotics (e.g., nitrofurantoin, isoniazid), antipsychotics (e.g., chlorpromazine), NSAIDs (e.g., indomethacin), antiparkinson drugs (e.g., levodopa), levothyroxine, phenytoin, and other antacids. May also interact with alcohol, which can exacerbate acidity.  This combination can also interfere with the absorption of other drugs.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category:  Not formally classified by the FDA.  Use with caution during pregnancy only if benefits clearly outweigh risks.  It is unknown if the drug is excreted in breast milk. Use with caution while breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Magaldrate neutralizes stomach acid; dimethicone reduces gas bubble formation.
* **Side Effects:** Constipation, diarrhea, chalky taste, nausea, vomiting.  Rarely: aluminum intoxication, hypermagnesemia, hypophosphatemia.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe renal impairment, bowel obstruction.
* **Drug Interactions:** Multiple drug interactions possible (see Drug Interactions section).
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
* **Dosage:**  Adults: 5-10 mL after meals and at bedtime. Children:  Not recommended for children under 12.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Renal function, magnesium levels (especially in renal impairment).

## **Popular Combinations**

Often combined with oxetacaine or domperidone to provide broader relief of GI symptoms.

## **Precautions**

* General precautions include screening for allergies, renal impairment, and other relevant medical conditions. Monitor magnesium levels in patients with renal impairment.  Inform patients about potential drug interactions.
* Pregnant Women: Use with caution if the benefit outweighs the risk.
* Breastfeeding Mothers:  Caution advised; the drug may be excreted in breast milk.
* Children & Elderly:  Not recommended for use in children under 12.  Dose adjustment may be needed in the elderly based on organ function.
