## **Usage**

- Diosmin + Hesperidin is prescribed for the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI),  hemorrhoids (piles), and venous leg ulcers. It is also used to alleviate symptoms associated with CVI, such as heavy legs, pain, nocturnal leg cramps, and early morning restless legs.
- **Pharmacological classification:**  Phlebotonic, venoprotective, vasculoprotective, capillary stabilizing agent.
- **Mechanism of action:** Diosmin + Hesperidin improves venous tone by inhibiting the breakdown of norepinephrine. It also strengthens capillaries and reduces capillary permeability, thereby decreasing microcirculation damage and inflammation.  

## **Alternate Names**

- Micronized Purified Flavonoid Fraction (MPFF)
- **Brand Names:** Daflon 500, Detralex, Diovenor, Barosmin, Flebosten, Litosmil, Venosmine

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Diosmin + Hesperidin enhances venous tone, reduces venous capacitance and distensibility, normalizes capillary permeability and resistance, and increases venous emptying time. It also exhibits anti-inflammatory effects by reducing leukocyte activation and inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators (free radicals and prostaglandins).
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Diosmin is metabolized in the intestine to diosmetin, its active aglycone metabolite. Diosmetin is then further degraded into phenolic acids and their glycine conjugates. It's primarily eliminated through renal excretion (urine), with some elimination through the feces.
- **Mode of action:**  Improves venous tone by inhibiting the breakdown of norepinephrine.  Reduces capillary permeability and fragility. Exerts anti-inflammatory actions by decreasing leukocyte activation and inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators.
- **Receptor binding/Enzyme inhibition/Neurotransmitter modulation:** Inhibits the breakdown of norepinephrine.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion (urine) with some elimination through the feces.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- **Chronic Venous Insufficiency:** 1000 mg daily, either as two 500 mg doses (one midday and one evening) or a single 1000 mg dose in the morning.
