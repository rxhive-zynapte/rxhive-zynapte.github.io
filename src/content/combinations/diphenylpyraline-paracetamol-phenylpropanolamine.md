## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of the common cold and influenza. It addresses symptoms such as nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, headache, fever, and body aches.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing a first-generation antihistamine (diphenylpyraline), an analgesic/antipyretic (paracetamol), and a decongestant (phenylpropanolamine).
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Paracetamol reduces fever and relieves pain by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Diphenylpyraline blocks histamine H1 receptors, alleviating allergic symptoms like runny nose and sneezing. Phenylpropanolamine acts as a sympathomimetic, constricting blood vessels in the nasal mucosa to reduce congestion.


## **Alternate Names**

- While there isn't a universally recognized alternate name for the combination itself, the individual components have various names (e.g., acetaminophen for paracetamol).
- **Brand Names:** This combination is marketed under various brand names like Cofmol.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Paracetamol exerts its analgesic and antipyretic effects centrally, while diphenylpyraline acts peripherally to block histamine H1 receptors. Phenylpropanolamine, as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, causes vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Paracetamol is rapidly absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, and excreted renally. Diphenylpyraline is also well-absorbed orally, with hepatic metabolism and renal excretion. Phenylpropanolamine is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and it is also primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine.
- **Mode of Action:** Paracetamol inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the central nervous system, reducing prostaglandin production. Diphenylpyraline competitively antagonizes histamine at H1 receptors. Phenylpropanolamine stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle, causing vasoconstriction.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for all three components, following hepatic metabolism. Paracetamol is conjugated with glucuronide and sulfate, while diphenylpyraline undergoes various metabolic pathways.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  The usual dose for adults is one tablet or a measured dose of oral suspension every 4-6 hours as needed.  The maximum daily dose should not be exceeded.

#### **Children:**  Dosage should be based on the child's weight or age as advised by the doctor. Pediatric safety considerations should be addressed, and appropriate formulations (e.g., syrup) should be used.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments might be required based on renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dosage modification is needed, considering creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Adjustments are necessary due to altered drug metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or other relevant conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of this combination in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, and the ICU isn't standard practice.  Individual components may be used in these settings under appropriate monitoring.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are necessary based on individual patient characteristics, including renal/hepatic function and comorbid conditions.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, restlessness, insomnia.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), hepatotoxicity (with paracetamol overdose), cardiovascular effects (hypertension, palpitations, arrhythmias), stroke (associated with phenylpropanolamine), seizures.

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Potential for hepatotoxicity with chronic paracetamol overuse.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hepatic failure, hypertensive crisis, stroke.


## **Contraindications**

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (Phenylpropanolamine). Use only if benefits outweigh risks.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Paracetamol is considered compatible with breastfeeding, but the safety of diphenylpyraline and phenylpropanolamine in breastfeeding is uncertain. Exercise caution and consider risks versus benefits.
