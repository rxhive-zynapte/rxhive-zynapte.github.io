## **Usage**

This combination vaccine is indicated for active immunization against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), hepatitis B, poliomyelitis (polio), and invasive disease caused by *Haemophilus influenzae* type b (Hib) in infants and young children.  It is crucial to administer this vaccine according to the official recommendations of the relevant health authority.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Vaccine (Combined). This classification signifies its role as an active immunizing agent.

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination vaccine stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies against the included toxoids (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis) and antigens (hepatitis B, filamentous hemagglutinin, pertactin, Hib capsular polysaccharide, and poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3).  This generates active immunity, protecting the vaccinated individual against the targeted diseases.


## **Alternate Names**

There is no official international non-proprietary name (INN) for this specific combination vaccine. The name typically used is a description of its components.

**Brand Names:** Infanrix hexa


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** This vaccine works by introducing inactivated toxins (toxoids) and antigens into the body. These components mimic the natural infection without causing the actual disease. The immune system recognizes these components as foreign and produces specific antibodies. These antibodies remain in the body, providing long-term protection against future exposure to the pathogens.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The pharmacokinetic profile of this complex combination vaccine isn't typically described in traditional terms (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination).  The individual components are processed differently.  For example, the polysaccharide component of Hib is primarily processed by the reticuloendothelial system. Toxoids are processed like proteins. The aluminum salts in the vaccine act as adjuvants to enhance the immune response.  The immune response, namely antibody titers, is the key measure of the vaccine's effectiveness.

**Mode of Action:** The vaccine components stimulate B lymphocytes to produce antibodies specific to each pathogen's antigens or toxoids. This immune response provides immunological memory, enabling the body to quickly recognize and neutralize the actual pathogens upon future encounters, thus preventing disease onset.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

**Infants:** The primary vaccination schedule typically consists of three doses (0.5 mL each), administered at 2, 4, and 6 months of age.  A booster dose is recommended later, according to official recommendations.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Common side effects at the injection site may include pain, redness, and swelling.  Fever, irritability, and loss of appetite can also occur.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Rarely, more serious side effects such as high fever, persistent crying, allergic reactions, or neurological events have been reported.  Immediate medical attention is necessary if such reactions occur.


## **Contraindications**

Contraindications include a history of severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine or after a previous dose of a similar vaccine.


## **Drug Interactions**

Immunosuppressant medications may reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine. Concurrent administration with other vaccines is generally well-tolerated, but it is crucial to follow official recommendations regarding the timing and administration of multiple vaccines.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

This vaccine is not intended for use in pregnant or breastfeeding individuals.
