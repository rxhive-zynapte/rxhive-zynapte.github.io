      + Pertussis Toxoid + Tetanus Toxoid?**


      **A:** For children, the primary series consists of three 0.5 mL doses at
      2, 4, and 6 months of age, with boosters at 15-18 months and 4-6 years.
      Adults who didn't receive the vaccine in childhood should receive a single
      dose of Tdap, followed by Td boosters every 10 years.  Pregnant women
      should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27-36 weeks of
      gestation.

## **Usage**

This combination vaccine is prescribed for the prevention of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), and hepatitis B. It's a crucial part of routine childhood immunizations.  It belongs to the pharmacological class of vaccines.

The vaccine works by stimulating an active immune response.  The toxoids (inactivated toxins) of diphtheria and tetanus and the antigens from pertussis and hepatitis B virus trigger the body to produce antibodies against these pathogens.  This creates immunity without causing the actual diseases.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination vaccine may be referred to as DTP-HepB, or as a pentavalent vaccine when combined with Hib.  Brand names can vary regionally; one example is Pediarix when combined with Polio and Hib.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The vaccine components stimulate the immune system, specifically B lymphocytes, to produce antibodies against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and hepatitis B.  These antibodies provide long-term immunity against these diseases.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The vaccine is administered intramuscularly. The toxoids and antigens are slowly released from the injection site.  The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of individual components may vary. It is important to remember that this is a vaccine to prevent a disease and the elimination of the antigens is not relevant.

**Mode of Action:**  The vaccine introduces inactivated toxins (toxoids) for diphtheria and tetanus, along with specific pertussis antigens and hepatitis B surface antigen.  These components are recognized by the body as foreign, triggering an immune response. This results in the production of specific antibodies that neutralize the toxins or pathogens upon subsequent exposure.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Children:**

The standard dosage for children is a series of three primary doses, given at 2, 4, and 6 months of age.  Booster doses are recommended at 15-18 months and 4-6 years of age.  Each dose is 0.5 mL administered intramuscularly, preferably in the anterolateral thigh for infants and young children or the deltoid muscle in older children.

#### **Adults:**

For adults who have not previously received pertussis vaccination, a single dose of Tdap (tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine) is recommended, followed by Td (tetanus and diphtheria toxoids) boosters every ten years.  Tdap is also recommended during each pregnancy, ideally between 27 and 36 weeks gestation.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Premature Infants:** Premature infants may experience apnea after vaccination and therefore should be monitored post-vaccination.  The decision to vaccinate premature infants should be made on a case-by-case basis.

* **Immunocompromised Patients:** Individuals with severe immunodeficiency should not receive live vaccines, but may be able to receive inactivated vaccines like DTP-HepB.  Consult specialized guidelines.

* **Patients with Chronic Illnesses:** Patients with chronic illnesses like diabetes or cardiovascular disease should receive the vaccine as recommended.  Dose modifications are typically not necessary.

### **Clinical Use Cases:**  The combination vaccine is used for *primary and booster immunization* against the target diseases.  It is not used in acute management situations related to intubation, surgery, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency conditions.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Common side effects include soreness, redness, and swelling at the injection site, low-grade fever, fussiness, drowsiness, loss of appetite, vomiting, and diarrhea.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Serious side effects are rare, but may include allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), seizures, high fever (≥105°F or 40.5°C), persistent crying, and hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes (collapse or shock-like state).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term side effects from DTP-HepB are extremely rare.

## **Contraindications**

Contraindications include a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose or to a vaccine component, and encephalopathy within 7 days of a prior dose of pertussis-containing vaccine not attributable to another identifiable cause.


## **Drug Interactions**

Immunosuppressants can reduce the immune response to the vaccine and increase the risk of infection from concomitant live vaccines. Corticosteroids can also reduce the immune response.  While these medications don't necessarily contraindicate DTP-HepB administration, caution is advised.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The vaccine is considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding and it is recommended in every pregnancy, ideally between 27 and 36 weeks gestation.  Maternal antibodies may be passed to the infant through breast milk, offering additional protection.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Stimulates active immunity against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and hepatitis B.
* **Side Effects:**  Common: local reactions, fever, fussiness.  Rare: allergic reactions, seizures, high fever.
* **Contraindications:** Severe allergy to vaccine components, encephalopathy following prior pertussis vaccination.
* **Drug Interactions:** Immunosuppressants, corticosteroids.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Safe and recommended.
* **Dosage:**  Series of three doses in infancy, boosters in childhood and adolescence, and during each pregnancy.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for adverse reactions, particularly in the 48 hours following vaccination.

## **Popular Combinations**

DTP-HepB is often combined with inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) and *Haemophilus influenzae* type b (Hib) vaccine. This creates a hexavalent or pentavalent vaccine, reducing the number of injections required.


## **Precautions**

Screen for contraindications before administration.  Monitor for adverse events after vaccination. For premature infants, evaluate the risk of apnea.  Counsel patients on possible side effects. Ensure appropriate spacing between doses.
