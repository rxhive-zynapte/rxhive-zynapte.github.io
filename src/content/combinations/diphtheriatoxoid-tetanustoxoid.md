## **Usage**

- Diphtheria Toxoid + Tetanus Toxoid (DT/Td) vaccine is prescribed for active immunization against diphtheria and tetanus infections. DT is used for primary and booster vaccination in children under 7 years old. Td, with a reduced diphtheria toxoid concentration, is utilized for primary and booster vaccination in individuals 7 years and older. 
- Pharmacological Classification:  Vaccine/Toxoid
- Mechanism of Action: Stimulates active immunity by inducing the production of specific antitoxins against diphtheria and tetanus toxins. These antitoxins neutralize the bacterial toxins, thereby preventing the diseases.

## **Alternate Names**

- Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids Adsorbed (DT/Td)
- Tetanus and Diphtheria Toxoids Adsorbed (Td)
- Brand names include but are not limited to TDVAX, TENIVAC, DECAVAC, and MassBiologics' Td.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: DT/Td vaccines work by triggering the body's immune system to produce antibodies (antitoxins) that specifically target and neutralize the toxins generated by *Corynebacterium diphtheriae* and *Clostridium tetani*, respectively.  This prevents the toxins from binding to their target receptors and causing cellular damage.
- **Pharmacokinetics**:  The toxoids are adsorbed onto an aluminum adjuvant, which enhances immunogenicity by creating a depot effect at the injection site, leading to slow release and prolonged antigen exposure. The toxoids are then processed by antigen-presenting cells, ultimately leading to B-cell activation and antibody production.  Elimination of the toxoid and its byproducts is believed to occur via normal metabolic pathways. Detailed pharmacokinetic parameters are not typically studied for vaccines.
- **Mode of Action**:  The toxoids in DT/Td vaccines act as antigens, stimulating both humoral and cellular immune responses.  Aluminum phosphate (or aluminum hydroxide) is commonly used as an adjuvant in vaccines.  An adjuvant enhances the immunogenicity of the vaccine by triggering immune activation via the innate immune system and promoting antigen uptake by antigen-presenting cells, like macrophages and dendritic cells.  They also prolong the duration of antigen presentation and stimulate a local inflammatory response at the site of injection to enhance immune stimulation and recruitment of lymphocytes, leading to activation and antibody production by B cells. The antibodies generated against the toxoids neutralize the biologically active toxins produced by the bacteria.
- **Elimination Pathways**: The elimination pathways are not completely characterized, but metabolic processes and typical protein clearance mechanisms are likely involved.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (Td):**

- 0.5 mL IM injection into the deltoid muscle.
- Primary immunization: Three doses administered at 0, 4-8 weeks, and 6-12 months.
- Booster dose: Every 10 years thereafter.


#### **Children (DT):**

- 0.5 mL IM injection.
- Primary immunization: Three doses at 2, 4, and 6 months of age.
- Booster doses: One dose at 15-18 months, and another at 4-6 years.



#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Standard adult dose.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Standard adult dose.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Standard adult dose.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Generally, the standard dose is recommended, but individual patient considerations may necessitate adjustments.


### **Clinical Use Cases:**

DT/Td is not typically indicated for acute management in clinical settings like intubation, surgery, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU. It is primarily used for prevention. Emergency situations involving potential exposure to *C. tetani* might require tetanus immunoglobulin in addition to or instead of Td, depending on the patient's vaccination history.


### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Specific dosage adjustments may be needed for immunocompromised individuals or in cases of adverse reactions to previous doses. These adjustments would involve personalized assessments and medical guidance.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

- Local reactions at the injection site: pain, redness, swelling, induration.
- Systemic reactions: low-grade fever, malaise, headache, myalgia, arthralgia.



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions: rash, urticaria, pruritus, anaphylaxis (rare).
- Neurological events:  brachial neuritis, Guillain-Barré syndrome (very rare).



### **Long-Term Effects:**

No specific long-term adverse effects are associated with DT/Td vaccination.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Serious allergic reactions require immediate medical attention.
- Neurological events, though rare, warrant thorough evaluation.


## **Contraindications**

- History of severe allergic reaction to any vaccine component, including tetanus or diphtheria toxoid.
- Encephalopathy within 7 days of a previous dose of a pertussis-containing vaccine (for Tdap).
- Guillain-Barré syndrome within 6 weeks of a previous tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccine (for tetanus-containing vaccines).
- Moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever (vaccination should be postponed).


## **Drug Interactions**

- Immunosuppressants (e.g., corticosteroids, cyclosporine): May reduce the immune response to the vaccine.
- Concomitant administration of other vaccines: Generally safe but administer with separate syringes at different injection sites.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Pregnancy Safety Category:  Benefit generally outweighs risk.  Tdap is recommended during the third trimester of each pregnancy.
- Breastfeeding:  No specific contraindications. Vaccination is generally considered safe during breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Induces active immunity by stimulating antibody production against diphtheria and tetanus toxins.
- **Side Effects:** Commonly local injection site reactions and mild systemic symptoms; rarely severe allergic reactions or neurological events.
- **Contraindications:** Severe allergy to vaccine components, encephalopathy after prior pertussis vaccination, Guillain-Barré syndrome after tetanus-containing vaccines, moderate/severe acute illness.
- **Drug Interactions:** Immunosuppressants, concomitant vaccines.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe; Tdap recommended during pregnancy.
- **Dosage:** Adults/Children: 0.5 mL IM; specific schedules for primary and booster doses. See sections above for more information.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Observation for immediate allergic reactions; monitor for local and systemic reactions.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Tdap (for adolescents and adults):  Combines tetanus, diphtheria (reduced dose), and acellular pertussis vaccines.
- Other combinations containing DT/Td with various pediatric vaccines, such as Hepatitis B, Hib, and IPV.


## **Precautions**

- Screen for contraindications and prior reactions.
- Postpone vaccination in cases of moderate or severe acute illness.
- Pregnant women: Tdap is recommended during the third trimester.
- Breastfeeding mothers: Generally safe.
- Children and elderly: Adhere to age-specific schedules.
- Lifestyle considerations:  No specific restrictions.
