## **Usage**

- Docaravimab + Miromavimab is prescribed for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) of rabies following suspected exposure to the rabies virus.  This includes bites, scratches, or other forms of contact with potentially infected animals.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Rabies monoclonal antibody cocktail.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Docaravimab and Miromavimab are monoclonal antibodies that bind to different epitopes on the rabies virus glycoprotein, neutralizing the virus before it can establish infection in the nervous system. This provides passive immunity, bridging the gap until the individual develops their own active immune response through vaccination.


## **Alternate Names** 
- Twinrab™, Rabimabs™
- **Brand Names:** Twinrab


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Docaravimab and Miromavimab neutralize rabies virus by binding to distinct epitopes on the viral glycoprotein. This prevents the virus from entering host cells and replicating.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** The medication is administered via intramuscular injection, ideally infiltrating the wound site if applicable.  The antibodies are then distributed systemically. Specific data on metabolism and elimination pathways are limited, but it's expected that they are handled similarly to other monoclonal antibodies.
- **Mode of Action:**  The antibodies physically block the interaction between the rabies virus and host cell receptors, preventing viral entry and subsequent replication.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** The primary mechanism is receptor blocking of the rabies virus glycoprotein. No significant enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation is involved.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Data on specific elimination pathways are limited, but similar to other monoclonal antibodies, elimination is likely to be primarily through proteolytic degradation.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**  
#### **Adults and Children:**  
- 40 IU/kg body weight as a single dose administered intramuscularly. The dose should be infiltrated around the wound site as much as anatomically feasible. Any remaining volume can be administered intramuscularly at a distant site.

#### **Special Cases:**  
- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustment is generally required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustment is generally required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustment is generally required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider comorbidities on a case-by-case basis, but generally no specific dose adjustment is required for Docaravimab + Miromavimab.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  
Docaravimab + Miromavimab is indicated for all WHO Category II and III exposures to suspected rabid animals.  It does not replace the need for rabies vaccination in these cases but is given in conjunction.  It is not typically indicated for pre-exposure prophylaxis.

### **Dosage Adjustments**  
No standard dosage adjustments based on renal/hepatic function or drug interactions are currently established.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
- Localized injection site reactions (pain, swelling, redness).
- Mild fever.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.

### **Long-Term Effects**  
No long-term adverse effects are known as it is a single-dose treatment.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
- Anaphylaxis (requires immediate intervention).


## **Contraindications**
- Known hypersensitivity to Docaravimab, Miromavimab, or any component of the formulation.


## **Drug Interactions**
- No clinically significant drug interactions have been specifically documented.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
- Limited data are available regarding use in pregnancy and breastfeeding. The benefits of rabies prevention should be weighed against potential, but unknown, risks to the fetus or infant. 


## **Drug Profile Summary**
- **Mechanism of Action:** Neutralization of rabies virus by binding to the glycoprotein.
- **Side Effects:** Injection site reactions, fever, rarely anaphylaxis.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:** No significant interactions known.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Limited data; weigh benefits versus potential risks.
- **Dosage:** 40 IU/kg, single intramuscular dose.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Observe for signs of allergic reactions.



## **Popular Combinations**
-  Always administered in conjunction with a rabies vaccine.


## **Precautions**
- Assess for prior allergic reactions to monoclonal antibodies.
- Monitor for signs and symptoms of allergic reactions post-administration.
- Ensure appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis with rabies vaccine according to established guidelines.
