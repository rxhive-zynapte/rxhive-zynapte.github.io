## **Usage**

Domperidone + Ilaprazole is prescribed for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcers, dyspepsia, and gastroparesis.  It is also used to treat nausea and vomiting.  This combination medication falls under the pharmacological classifications of gastrointestinal agents, specifically proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and antiemetics.

Domperidone increases the movements or contractions of the stomach and intestines, speeding up the transit of food through the digestive system. Ilaprazole decreases the amount of acid produced in the stomach.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for this specific combination drug, although it may sometimes be referred to as Ilaprazole/Domperidone.  Brand names may vary regionally.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Domperidone is a dopamine antagonist that blocks dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) and the vomiting center, reducing nausea and vomiting.  It also acts peripherally to increase esophageal peristalsis and accelerate gastric emptying. Ilaprazole is a proton pump inhibitor. It irreversibly binds to the hydrogen-potassium ATPase enzyme (proton pump) in gastric parietal cells, inhibiting gastric acid secretion.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Domperidone is rapidly absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 30-60 minutes.  It undergoes hepatic metabolism, primarily via CYP3A4. Ilaprazole is also rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP enzymes, primarily CYP3A4 and CYP2C19. Both drugs are primarily eliminated through hepatic routes, with some renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

Dosage guidelines should be individualized based on the patient's condition and response.  Always consult with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate dose.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
A common adult dosage is one tablet containing 10mg Ilaprazole and 30mg Domperidone, taken once daily, 15-30 minutes before a meal.  However, the specific formulation and dosage may vary depending on the indication and the prescribing physician's judgment.

#### **Children:**
The safety and effectiveness of Domperidone + Ilaprazole have not been established in children under 12 years old.  Some sources indicate its use in children over 12 years old, but specific dosing recommendations vary.  Consult a pediatrician for appropriate guidance.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Dosage adjustments may be required based on renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Domperidone + Ilaprazole should be used with caution, and dosage adjustments are typically required.  In moderate to severe hepatic impairment, it may be contraindicated.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Adjustments may be necessary based on the specific condition.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The fixed-dose combination of Domperidone + Ilaprazole is not typically used in the context of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  In these cases, separate formulations and individualized dosing of each drug are preferred to provide greater control over treatment.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on patient-specific factors such as age, renal function, hepatic function, and comorbidities.  Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism, particularly CYP2C19, may also influence drug efficacy and require dose modifications.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Diarrhea
- Stomach pain
- Flatulence
- Dry mouth
- Headache
- Dizziness
- Fatigue

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
- Cardiac arrhythmias (QT prolongation)
- Extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g., tremors, dystonia)
- Hyperprolactinemia

### **Long-Term Effects:**
- Increased risk of fractures with long-term PPI use
- Potential for vitamin B12 deficiency
- Increased risk of *Clostridium difficile* infection


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to domperidone, ilaprazole, or any component of the formulation
- Gastrointestinal bleeding
- Mechanical obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract
- Perforation of the gastrointestinal tract
- Prolactinoma
- Moderate to severe hepatic impairment
- Concomitant use of drugs that prolong the QT interval (e.g., certain antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics)
- Concomitant use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole)

## **Drug Interactions**

- Ketoconazole, itraconazole (CYP3A4 inhibitors) can increase plasma concentrations of both domperidone and ilaprazole.
- Drugs that prolong the QT interval (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol, certain antipsychotics) may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
- Antacids may decrease the absorption of ilaprazole.
- Ilaprazole may decrease the absorption of certain drugs that require an acidic environment (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts).

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Domperidone + Ilaprazole should be used with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Consult a healthcare professional to assess the benefit-risk ratio.  Limited data are available on the use of this combination during pregnancy. Domperidone is excreted in breast milk, and while amounts are small, its use during breastfeeding should be evaluated carefully.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Domperidone is a dopamine antagonist that increases gastrointestinal motility and reduces nausea and vomiting. Ilaprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that reduces gastric acid secretion.
- **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, stomach pain, flatulence, dry mouth, headache, dizziness, and QT prolongation.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, GI bleeding or obstruction, prolactinoma, hepatic impairment, concomitant use of QT-prolonging drugs or potent CYP3A4 inhibitors.
- **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors, QT prolonging drugs, antacids.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution.  Consult a healthcare professional.
- **Dosage:** Varies depending on indication and patient factors. Typically one tablet containing 10mg ilaprazole and 30mg domperidone, taken once daily before meals.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Electrolytes, liver function tests, ECG for QT interval, symptoms of adverse effects.

## **Popular Combinations**

While Domperidone + Ilaprazole is itself a combination,  other drugs, like antacids for symptom relief may be added to the therapeutic regimen.  However, the need for such combinations should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

## **Precautions**

- Patients with renal or hepatic impairment should be closely monitored.
- Baseline ECG should be considered, especially in patients at risk of QT prolongation.
- Monitor for extrapyramidal symptoms, particularly in elderly patients.
- Monitor for signs and symptoms of hyperprolactinemia (e.g., galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia).
