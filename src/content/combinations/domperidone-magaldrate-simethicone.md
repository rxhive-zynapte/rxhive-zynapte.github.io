## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of gastrointestinal discomfort associated with conditions like dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), heartburn, bloating, and gas.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing a gastroprokinetic (domperidone), an antacid (magaldrate), and an anti-flatulent (simethicone).

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Domperidone blocks dopamine receptors, increasing gastrointestinal motility and reducing nausea and vomiting. Magaldrate neutralizes stomach acid, offering relief from heartburn and indigestion. Simethicone reduces the surface tension of gas bubbles, facilitating their expulsion.


## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination. Several brand names are available depending on the manufacturer and region. Some examples include Aciset-7D, Ambifast, Antav D, Kastdom, Domheal, Antaric DM, and Wellcid-D.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Domperidone, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, enhances gastric emptying and reduces esophageal reflux. Magaldrate, a combination of magnesium and aluminum hydroxides, neutralizes gastric acid. Simethicone, a surfactant, disperses gas bubbles.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Domperidone is rapidly absorbed orally, metabolized by the liver (CYP3A4), and excreted in urine and feces. Magaldrate is not absorbed systemically, acting locally in the gastrointestinal tract and excreted in feces. Simethicone is not absorbed, passing through the digestive system unchanged and eliminated in feces.

- **Mode of Action:** Domperidone acts on dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and the gastrointestinal tract.  Magaldrate chemically neutralizes hydrochloric acid in the stomach. Simethicone alters the surface tension of gas bubbles, causing them to coalesce and be expelled more easily.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Domperidone: Hepatic metabolism (CYP3A4), renal and fecal excretion. Magaldrate: Fecal excretion. Simethicone: Fecal excretion unchanged.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The typical adult dosage is 5-10 ml of the suspension, taken orally three times daily, after meals and at bedtime. Dosage may vary based on the formulation and should be taken as directed by a physician.

#### **Children:**

Use in children under 12 is generally not recommended. For children over 12, the adult dose may be appropriate, but a doctor should be consulted.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised, and dosage adjustments may be required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Domperidone metabolism may be affected, requiring dosage adjustments.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration is required in patients with heart conditions due to the potential for QT prolongation with domperidone.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is not specifically indicated for use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU.  It primarily addresses symptomatic relief of gastrointestinal issues.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments should be made based on patient-specific factors such as renal and hepatic function, cardiac conditions, and concomitant medications.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, altered taste, headache, dizziness, drowsiness.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions, cardiac arrhythmias (QT prolongation), extrapyramidal symptoms (with high doses of domperidone).

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term use of domperidone may be associated with an increased risk of cardiac events, particularly in older adults and those with underlying cardiac conditions.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Serious ADRs are rare but may include cardiac arrhythmias, hypersensitivity reactions, and neurologic effects.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any component, gastrointestinal bleeding, mechanical obstruction or perforation of the GI tract, prolactinoma, concurrent use of QT prolonging drugs, severe hepatic or renal impairment.


## **Drug Interactions**

QT prolonging drugs, anticholinergic drugs, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, antacids containing aluminum or magnesium, certain antihypertensives, alcohol.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Consult a healthcare professional for guidance.  Domperidone is excreted in breast milk.
