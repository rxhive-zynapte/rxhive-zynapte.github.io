## **Usage**

Domperidone + Naproxen is prescribed for the treatment of migraine headaches, relieving symptoms such as headache, nausea, and vomiting. It is also used to reduce pain associated with various conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, acute gout, tendinitis, menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea), and other muscle and bone disorders.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Naproxen: Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID)
* Domperidone: Antiemetic, Prokinetic

**Mechanism of Action:**

Naproxen reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, primarily by blocking cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes.  Domperidone is a dopamine antagonist that acts on receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the brain and the gastrointestinal tract. It enhances gastrointestinal motility, reduces nausea, and prevents vomiting. Combining these two drugs provides synergistic relief for conditions involving both pain and nausea/vomiting.


## **Alternate Names**

There is no internationally recognized non-proprietary name for this combination. Alternate names are often based on brand names.

**Brand Names:**
Some examples include Naproxzen D, Naprita D, Naxolid. (Note: Brand names can vary regionally.)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

Naproxen exerts its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Domperidone acts as a dopamine antagonist, primarily in the gastrointestinal tract and the CTZ, leading to increased gastric emptying and reduced nausea and vomiting.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Naproxen:** Well absorbed orally.  Metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 enzymes. Excreted mainly in urine.
* **Domperidone:**  Orally absorbed, but bioavailability is low due to first-pass metabolism. Metabolized in the liver, including by CYP3A4. Excreted in urine and feces.

**Mode of Action:**

* **Naproxen:** Inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, decreasing prostaglandin production.
* **Domperidone:** Antagonizes dopamine D2 receptors in the gastrointestinal tract and the CTZ.

**Elimination Pathways:**

* **Naproxen:** Primarily renal excretion.
* **Domperidone:** Renal and hepatic excretion.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Dosage varies depending on the specific condition and the formulation used. A common dose is one tablet of Naproxen 500 mg + Domperidone 10 mg twice daily. It's typically recommended to take the medication with food to reduce gastrointestinal irritation.  For Naproxen 250 mg + Domperidone 10 mg, the dosage could be one tablet two to three times daily.


#### **Children:**

Dosage is determined by weight or age, and the combination is generally not recommended for children under 12 years of age unless specifically directed by a physician. A liquid formulation may be more appropriate for younger children if prescribed. 


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Lower doses are generally recommended, starting with the lowest effective dose and adjusting as needed. Close monitoring for adverse effects is crucial.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment is necessary based on the degree of impairment. Close monitoring is essential.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction is recommended, and careful monitoring is required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and gastrointestinal disorders. Dose adjustment may be necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The specific use of Domperidone + Naproxen in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations is not routinely indicated.  Pain management in these settings usually employs different analgesics and antiemetics based on the patient’s condition.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are required for patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, based on the severity of the impairment. In patients with other comorbid conditions, adjustments should be made on a case-by-case basis, considering potential drug interactions and the patient’s overall health status.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Nausea
* Abdominal discomfort
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth
* Fluid retention



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers
* Myocardial infarction
* Stroke
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Cardiac arrhythmias (with Domperidone)
* Extrapyramidal symptoms (with Domperidone)


### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term use of NSAIDs like Naproxen may increase the risk of cardiovascular events and gastrointestinal complications. Chronic use of Domperidone can lead to hormonal imbalances, including increased prolactin levels.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs include severe gastrointestinal bleeding, allergic reactions, and cardiac events. With Domperidone, ADRs can include QT interval prolongation and extrapyramidal symptoms.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to Naproxen, Domperidone, or other NSAIDs.
* Active peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Severe liver or kidney impairment.
* Pregnancy (especially third trimester).
* Breastfeeding.
* Patients with certain cardiac conditions, including QT prolongation or significant electrolyte disturbances.
* Concurrent use of drugs that prolong the QT interval.


## **Drug Interactions**

* Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin)
* Other NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, ketorolac)
* Antihypertensives (e.g., ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers)
* Corticosteroids
* Antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel)
* Some antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs)
* Drugs that prolong the QT interval (e.g., some antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics)
* CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers (can affect Domperidone metabolism)



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Naproxen is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy due to the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. Use in earlier trimesters should be avoided unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk.  Domperidone is excreted in breast milk and may have adverse effects on the nursing infant. It's generally advised to avoid its use during breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Naproxen: COX inhibitor; Domperidone: Dopamine antagonist.
* **Side Effects:** Common: Nausea, GI upset, headache. Serious: GI bleeding, cardiovascular events.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, peptic ulcer, severe liver/kidney disease, pregnancy (3rd trimester), breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, other NSAIDs, antihypertensives.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in the 3rd trimester and during breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** Varies depending on the condition. Common adult dose: Naproxen 500 mg + Domperidone 10 mg twice daily.

## **Popular Combinations**

Domperidone is sometimes combined with other NSAIDs for similar indications. However, it’s crucial to assess potential drug interactions and adjust dosages accordingly.


## **Precautions**

Pre-screening for allergies, cardiovascular disease, renal or hepatic impairment, and gastrointestinal disorders is important before initiating therapy.  Caution is advised in elderly patients and those with pre-existing medical conditions.  Avoid alcohol during treatment with Naproxen.  Monitor for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and other adverse effects.
