## **Usage**

Domperidone + Omeprazole is prescribed for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), dyspepsia, and other gastrointestinal motility disorders where delayed gastric emptying contributes to symptoms like nausea, vomiting, bloating, and epigastric discomfort.  It is also indicated for the treatment of heartburn, acid reflux, and stomach ulcers.

This combination medication falls under the following pharmacological classifications:

* **Domperidone:** Dopamine antagonist, antiemetic, prokinetic.
* **Omeprazole:** Proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

**Mechanism of Action:**  Omeprazole reduces gastric acid secretion by irreversibly inhibiting the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system (proton pump) in the parietal cells of the gastric mucosa. Domperidone, on the other hand, is a peripheral dopamine receptor antagonist that blocks the inhibitory effects of dopamine on gastrointestinal motility. This increases lower esophageal sphincter pressure and accelerates gastric emptying and transit.

## **Alternate Names**

This drug combination is most commonly referred to as Domperidone + Omeprazole. There isn't a single international non-proprietary name (INN) for the combination. It is generally identified by the names of its two active constituents.

**Brand Names:**  Limzer, Omez-DSR. Other brand names may exist regionally.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Omeprazole suppresses gastric acid secretion, leading to a decrease in gastric acidity.  Domperidone increases lower esophageal sphincter tone, improves antral and duodenal motility, and coordinates gastroduodenal activity to promote gastric emptying. It does not affect gastric secretions.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Omeprazole:** Absorption begins after it leaves the stomach (due to enteric coating), reaching peak plasma levels in 0.5-3.5 hours. Bioavailability is 30-40% due to first-pass metabolism.  It is highly protein-bound (95%) and metabolized by CYP450 enzymes. Elimination half-life is 0.5-1 hour, primarily via hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.
* **Domperidone:**  Absorption is rapid, but bioavailability is low due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Peak plasma levels are achieved in about an hour. It is also highly protein-bound and extensively metabolized in the liver, predominantly by CYP3A4.  Elimination is primarily through hepatic metabolism with some renal excretion.


**Mode of Action:**  Omeprazole irreversibly blocks the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme system in parietal cells, reducing acid secretion. Domperidone antagonizes peripheral dopamine D2 receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, facilitating motility.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition:** Omeprazole inhibits the proton pump (H+/K+-ATPase).  Domperidone antagonizes dopamine D2 receptors.

**Elimination Pathways:** Both drugs are primarily metabolized by the liver (CYP450 enzymes) and excreted via the kidneys.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The usual recommended dose is one capsule of Omeprazole 20mg + Domperidone 30mg once daily before meals. For domperidone monotherapy, the dosage can be 10mg three or four times a day, and may increase up to 20 mg three to four times daily if needed.

#### **Children:**

Safety and efficacy have not been established in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is generally required.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is generally required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution should be used in patients with severe liver impairment. Liver enzymes should be monitored regularly during treatment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Dose adjustments might be needed based on coexisting conditions. Consult current clinical guidelines and consider drug interactions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of domperidone and omeprazole is not typically indicated for use in clinical situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Other medications might be more appropriate in these scenarios.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient factors like hepatic or renal dysfunction, other metabolic disorders, or pharmacogenetic variations affecting drug metabolism.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Headache, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, and fatigue.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Cardiac arrhythmias (QT prolongation), extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g., tardive dyskinesia), hyperprolactinemia, gynecomastia, galactorrhea.

### **Long-Term Effects:**
Potential long-term effects are primarily associated with Domperidone, including the aforementioned extrapyramidal effects and endocrine disturbances with prolonged high doses. Long-term use of PPIs like Omeprazole has been associated with an increased risk of certain infections (e.g., *Clostridium difficile*), vitamin B12 deficiency, and potentially, fractures.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
Any signs of cardiac arrhythmias, extrapyramidal reactions, or severe hypersensitivity should prompt immediate discontinuation and medical attention.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to either domperidone or omeprazole.
* Gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction, or perforation.
* Prolactin-releasing pituitary tumor (prolactinoma).
* Concomitant use with drugs that prolong the QT interval.
* Conditions where increased gastrointestinal motility could be harmful (e.g., gastrointestinal bleeding).


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Omeprazole:** May interact with drugs metabolized by CYP450 enzymes, potentially altering their efficacy. Can affect the absorption of drugs whose bioavailability is pH-dependent (e.g., ketoconazole).
* **Domperidone:** Interacts with drugs that prolong the QT interval, increasing the risk of arrhythmias. May interact with dopamine agonists and anticholinergic drugs.
*  Concomitant use of Domperidone with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, atazanavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir) should be avoided as these inhibit the metabolism of domperidone, which can increase the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Domperidone is generally considered low risk during pregnancy but should only be used if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Omeprazole should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed. Data from large-scale studies indicate no adverse effects of Omeprazole on pregnancy outcome. Omeprazole is excreted in breast milk, but the risk of effects on the infant at therapeutic doses seem unlikely. Domperidone is contraindicated during breastfeeding.
