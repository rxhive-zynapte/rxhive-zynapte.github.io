## **Usage**

Domperidone + Ranitidine is a combination medication primarily used to treat gastrointestinal disorders where delayed gastric emptying and excess stomach acid are contributing factors.  Conditions this drug is prescribed for include:

* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
* Dyspepsia (indigestion)
* Nausea and vomiting associated with gastroparesis
* Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (a rare condition causing excessive stomach acid production)


It's **pharmacological classification** includes a prokinetic agent (domperidone) and a histamine H2-receptor antagonist (ranitidine).

Domperidone increases the movement of the stomach and intestines, speeding up gastric emptying. Ranitidine decreases stomach acid production.


## **Alternate Names**

While "Domperidone + Ranitidine" is the generic name, brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region.  One example is Rantac DOM. Motilium is an alternate name for Domperidone.


## **How It Works**

**Domperidone:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Domperidone is a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), located outside the blood-brain barrier. It also acts as a peripheral dopamine D2-receptor antagonist in the upper gastrointestinal tract, enhancing gastric motility and accelerating gastric emptying.
* **Pharmacokinetics:**  Domperidone is rapidly absorbed after oral administration.  It undergoes hepatic metabolism primarily via CYP3A4. The drug is excreted in both urine and feces.

**Ranitidine:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Ranitidine competitively inhibits the action of histamine at H2 receptors of the parietal cells in the stomach, reducing basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion.
* **Pharmacokinetics:**  Ranitidine is absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations reached in about 2 hours. It is partially metabolized in the liver. Excretion is primarily renal.

The combination of domperidone and ranitidine provides synergistic relief by addressing both gastric motility and acid secretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
The standard dose is one tablet of Domperidone 10mg + Ranitidine 150mg, taken three times a day, preferably 15-30 minutes before meals. In some cases, the dose may be increased to 20mg of Domperidone and 300 mg of Ranitidine, taken twice a day, or as prescribed by the physician.

#### **Children:**
Domperidone + Ranitidine is generally not recommended for children.  If used, the dose should be calculated based on the child's weight (1.2-2.4 mg/kg/day of domperidone and 2-4 mg/kg/day of ranitidine), divided into three or four doses. Pediatric use requires careful consideration of potential cardiac risks associated with domperidone.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary. Start with a lower dose and monitor for side effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Reduce the dose of both drugs based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Reduce the dose, particularly for domperidone.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Carefully assess potential drug interactions, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Domperidone + Ranitidine is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on individual patient characteristics, including renal and hepatic function, comorbid conditions, and concomitant medications.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Diarrhea or constipation
* Dry mouth
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Cardiac arrhythmias (QT prolongation)
* Extrapyramidal symptoms (movement disorders)
* Gynecomastia (breast enlargement in males)
* Galactorrhea (milk production)


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term use of this combination, especially domperidone, should be avoided due to the potential for cardiac side effects.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any signs of cardiac arrhythmia, extrapyramidal symptoms, or hypersensitivity reactions should prompt immediate discontinuation and medical intervention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to domperidone or ranitidine.
* Gastrointestinal hemorrhage or obstruction.
* Prolactinoma (a pituitary tumor).
* Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole).
* Patients with long QT syndrome or other cardiac conduction abnormalities.


## **Drug Interactions**

* Ketoconazole, itraconazole, and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increase domperidone levels.
* Antacids may reduce the absorption of ranitidine.
* Drugs that prolong the QT interval (e.g., some antiarrhythmics, macrolides) may increase the risk of arrhythmias.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Domperidone is excreted in breast milk.  Its use during breastfeeding should be carefully considered. Ranitidine's safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Domperidone: Dopamine D2 receptor antagonist; Ranitidine: H2 receptor antagonist.
* **Side Effects:** See sections above.
* **Contraindications:** See section above.
* **Drug Interactions:** See section above.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution.
* **Dosage:** See section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  ECG (for QT prolongation), liver function tests, renal function tests.
