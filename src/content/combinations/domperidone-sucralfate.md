## **Usage**

Domperidone + Sucralfate is prescribed for the treatment of peptic ulcers, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), indigestion, acidity, and nausea/vomiting associated with these conditions.  It falls under the pharmacological classifications of gastrointestinal agents, antiemetics, and mucosal protectants.  The combination works by protecting the stomach lining and promoting ulcer healing (sucralfate) while also reducing nausea and vomiting (domperidone).

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for the combination itself. However, the individual components have various international and regional variations. Domperidone may be known as Motilium in some regions.  Brand names for the combination product vary depending on the manufacturer and country, and include Domsafe and Sucrafil D.

## **How It Works**

**Sucralfate:** This agent acts locally in the stomach, forming a viscous, adhesive paste that binds to the ulcer base, creating a protective barrier against gastric acid, pepsin, and bile salts. This promotes ulcer healing and reduces pain.  It has limited systemic absorption, and what is absorbed is primarily excreted renally.

**Domperidone:**  This is a dopamine antagonist that acts primarily on peripheral dopamine D2 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) located outside the blood-brain barrier. It blocks dopamine's action in the CTZ, preventing nausea and vomiting. It increases lower esophageal sphincter pressure, and improves gastric emptying.  Domperidone undergoes hepatic metabolism primarily via CYP3A4.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The typical adult dose is 1 gram of sucralfate and 10 mg of domperidone, administered orally, 15-30 minutes before meals and at bedtime for 4-8 weeks for active duodenal ulcer and up to 1 year for prophylaxis.

#### **Children:**

Dosage in children must be determined by a physician. Recommendations range from 200-80 mcg/kg/dose of domperidone and 40-80 mg/kg/day of sucralfate given three to four times daily.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Begin therapy at the lower end of the dosing range and monitor renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Sucralfate contains aluminum, which can accumulate in renal failure.  Dosage adjustments may be required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Domperidone should be used with caution in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment due to the risk of increased serum concentrations. Dosage adjustments may be needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiac conditions. Domperidone has been linked to QT interval prolongation.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is primarily used for peptic ulcer disease and associated symptoms.  Dosage does not typically vary for clinical settings like intubation, surgery, or ICU use.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Always consider renal and hepatic function when prescribing this combination.  Dosage modifications are based on individual patient factors and clinical response. Monitor electrolyte levels in patients with renal impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Constipation, dry mouth, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), irregular heartbeat (QT prolongation), extrapyramidal symptoms (tremors, muscle rigidity).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Hyperprolactinemia and associated side effects such as galactorrhea, gynecomastia, and menstrual irregularities may be seen with long-term domperidone use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), cardiac arrhythmias, neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to domperidone or sucralfate, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical bowel obstruction, prolactinoma, QT prolongation, concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.

## **Drug Interactions**

Domperidone interacts with CYP3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin) and inducers (rifampin, phenytoin). Sucralfate can reduce the absorption of other drugs; administer other medications at least 2 hours apart. Antacids may decrease sucralfateâ€™s effectiveness.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Domperidone is generally considered safe during pregnancy.  However, it is excreted in breast milk.  Consult a physician before using during breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Sucralfate: Mucosal protectant; Domperidone: Dopamine antagonist.
* **Side Effects:** Constipation, dry mouth, headache, dizziness, extrapyramidal symptoms (rare).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, GI bleeding, obstruction, prolactinoma, QT prolongation.
* **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers, antacids.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Relatively safe in pregnancy, excreted in breast milk.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 1g sucralfate + 10mg domperidone 15-30 minutes before meals and at bedtime;  Pediatric dosage varies.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** ECG (for QT prolongation), renal function tests (for aluminum accumulation).

## **Popular Combinations**

Frequently combined with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2 blockers in managing peptic ulcer disease.

## **Precautions**

Screen for allergies, cardiac conditions, and renal/hepatic dysfunction. Caution advised in elderly patients.  Avoid alcohol.
