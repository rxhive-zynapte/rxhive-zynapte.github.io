## **Usage**

Donepezil + Memantine is prescribed for moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimer's type in patients stabilized on Donepezil 10 mg.  It belongs to the pharmacological classifications of cholinesterase inhibitors (Donepezil) and NMDA receptor antagonists (Memantine). Donepezil increases acetylcholine levels in the brain by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase. Memantine modulates the effects of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, by blocking NMDA receptors, thus potentially protecting neurons from excitotoxicity.

## **Alternate Names**

A common brand name for Donepezil + Memantine is Namzaric. Other brand names include Namzaric Titration Pack. There are no widely used alternate generic names.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Donepezil enhances cholinergic function by reversibly inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, increasing acetylcholine levels in the synaptic cleft. Memantine noncompetitively blocks NMDA receptors, modulating the effects of excessive glutamate, which can contribute to neuronal damage in Alzheimer's disease.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Donepezil is well-absorbed orally, metabolized primarily by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and eliminated mainly through hepatic metabolism and renal excretion. Memantine is also well-absorbed orally, minimally metabolized, and primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.

**Mode of Action:** Donepezil increases acetylcholine levels, thereby enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission, which is important for cognitive function. Memantine blocks the excessive stimulation of NMDA receptors by glutamate, potentially preventing excitotoxicity and neuronal damage.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Donepezil inhibits the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Memantine blocks NMDA receptors. This combination of mechanisms addresses both the cholinergic deficit and glutamatergic excitotoxicity implicated in Alzheimer's disease.

**Elimination Pathways:** Donepezil is eliminated through hepatic metabolism (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) and renal excretion. Memantine is primarily excreted unchanged through the kidneys.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
The recommended starting dose for patients stabilized on Donepezil 10 mg and not currently taking Memantine is Donepezil 10 mg + Memantine 7 mg once daily in the evening. The Memantine component can be increased in 7 mg increments weekly (to 14 mg/10 mg, then 21 mg/10 mg, finally reaching 28 mg/10 mg) up to the recommended maintenance dose of Donepezil 10 mg + Memantine 28 mg once daily, provided the previous dose is well-tolerated. For patients already stabilized on Donepezil 10 mg and Memantine (10 mg twice daily or 28 mg extended-release once daily), they can be switched directly to Donepezil 10 mg + Memantine 28 mg once daily. This switch should occur the day following the last doses of the individual medications.

#### **Children:**
The safety and efficacy of Donepezil + Memantine have not been established in pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Generally, no dosage adjustments are recommended based solely on age. However, close monitoring for adverse effects is essential.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  For patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 5 to 29 mL/min), the recommended maintenance dose is Donepezil 10 mg + Memantine 14 mg once daily.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  For patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, no dosage adjustment is necessary. Caution is advised in patients with severe hepatic impairment, and close monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Pre-existing conditions like asthma, cardiac disease, seizures, gastrointestinal ulcers, and urinary problems should be carefully considered before initiating therapy.

### **Clinical Use Cases**
Donepezil + Memantine is specifically indicated for moderate to severe Alzheimer's dementia. It is not indicated for use in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
Dosage adjustments may be required based on individual patient factors, including renal or hepatic impairment, comorbid conditions, and drug interactions.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, headache, dizziness, and easy bruising.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Syncope, bradycardia, seizures, severe or persistent vomiting, difficulty urinating, worsening breathing problems, and gastrointestinal bleeding.


### **Long-Term Effects:**
The long-term effects of Donepezil + Memantine are primarily related to the progression of Alzheimer's disease itself.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Clinically significant ADRs include severe gastrointestinal symptoms, cardiac arrhythmias, syncope, and seizures.


## **Contraindications**
Hypersensitivity to donepezil, memantine, piperidine derivatives, or any component of the formulation.


## **Drug Interactions**

Donepezil + Memantine can interact with numerous medications, including anticholinergics, antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine), antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole), antiepileptics (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine), and certain cardiovascular medications. Alcohol may exacerbate drowsiness.  Concomitant use with other NMDA antagonists (e.g., amantadine) may increase the risk of adverse effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy:** Donepezil is Pregnancy Category C, and Memantine is Pregnancy Category B. The drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.

**Breastfeeding:** It is unknown whether Donepezil + Memantine is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when administering to breastfeeding women.
