## **Usage**

- Dorzolamide + Timolol is prescribed for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who are insufficiently responsive to beta-blockers alone.  It is also used for pseudoexfoliative glaucoma.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Ophthalmic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and beta-blocker combination.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dorzolamide inhibits carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye, reducing aqueous humor formation. Timolol is a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent that decreases aqueous humor production. The combined effect leads to a greater reduction in IOP than either drug alone.

## **Alternate Names**

- Dorzolamide hydrochloride/timolol maleate
- **Brand Names:** Cosopt, Cosopt PF

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Reduces intraocular pressure by decreasing the production of aqueous humor.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Dorzolamide is absorbed systemically following topical ocular administration. Timolol is also absorbed systemically, although to a lesser extent than dorzolamide.
    - **Metabolism:** Dorzolamide is metabolized to a single N-desethyl metabolite that has less carbonic anhydrase inhibitory activity than the parent compound. Timolol is metabolized in the liver.
    - **Elimination:** Dorzolamide and its metabolite are primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Timolol is excreted primarily by the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:**
    - Dorzolamide inhibits carbonic anhydrase II in the ciliary processes, reducing bicarbonate ion formation, which subsequently decreases sodium and fluid transport, and thus aqueous humor production.
    - Timolol blocks beta-adrenergic receptors in the ciliary epithelium, leading to reduced aqueous humor production.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**  Dorzolamide inhibits carbonic anhydrase II. Timolol blocks beta-adrenergic receptors (non-selective).
- **Elimination pathways:**  Primarily renal excretion for both dorzolamide and timolol.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- One drop in the affected eye(s) twice daily (morning and evening).

#### **Children:**

- 2 years and older: One drop in the affected eye(s) twice daily.
- Younger than 2 years: Safety and efficacy have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Not recommended in severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min). Use with caution in mild to moderate impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution in patients with asthma, COPD, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, myasthenia gravis.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dorzolamide/Timolol is not typically used in these clinical settings:

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations**

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- Adjustments based on renal function are described above.  Dosage may need to be individualized based on the patient's response and tolerability.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Blurred vision, burning/stinging, itching, redness, tearing, dry eyes, altered taste (bitter, sour, metallic), headache.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Bronchospasm, bradycardia, hypotension, heart failure, syncope, severe allergic reactions (angioedema, urticaria).  Corneal endothelial damage.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Potential for worsening of pre-existing respiratory or cardiovascular conditions with chronic use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- As above, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis.

## **Contraindications**

- Bronchial asthma, history of bronchial asthma, severe COPD.
- Sinus bradycardia, second- or third-degree atrioventricular block, overt cardiac failure, cardiogenic shock.
- Hypersensitivity to any component of the product.
- Severe renal impairment.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Other beta-blockers (systemic and ophthalmic): Increased risk of bradycardia, hypotension.
- CYP2D6 inhibitors: May increase timolol levels.
- Oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors: Additive systemic effects.
- Calcium channel blockers:  Additive effects on heart rate and blood pressure.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  C (Timolol). Dorzolamide: data limited.
- Fetal risks:  Potential for bradycardia, hypotension, and respiratory depression in the neonate.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Timolol is present in breast milk.  Dorzolamide's presence is unknown. Not recommended during breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Decreases aqueous humor production.
- **Side Effects:** Ocular irritation, altered taste, bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm.
- **Contraindications:** Asthma/COPD, bradycardia/heart block, heart failure.
- **Drug Interactions:** Other beta-blockers, oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Not recommended.
- **Dosage:** One drop twice daily.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** IOP, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory function.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Often used as a standalone therapy, but may be combined with other IOP-lowering medications like prostaglandin analogs or alpha-agonists if additional IOP reduction is needed.

## **Precautions**

- Monitor for respiratory and cardiovascular side effects.
- Caution in patients with diabetes, hyperthyroidism, myasthenia gravis.
- Assess renal and hepatic function before initiating therapy.
- Educate patients on proper administration technique.
