## **Usage**

Doxofylline + Montelukast is prescribed for the treatment and management of respiratory conditions, primarily asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It is also used to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB).

This combination drug falls under the pharmacological classifications of bronchodilator (doxofylline) and leukotriene receptor antagonist (montelukast).

Doxofylline works by relaxing the airway muscles and widening the bronchi, facilitating easier breathing.  Montelukast inhibits the action of leukotrienes, inflammatory mediators that contribute to bronchoconstriction, mucus production, and airway inflammation.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Doxofylline + Montelukast" represents the generic name, various brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region. Some common examples include Doxolin M, Doxiflo-M, Doxoford-M, ABIDOX-M, Kivodoxo-M, Ishdox-M and Monteluke DX.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Doxofylline, a xanthine derivative, acts as a bronchodilator by inhibiting phosphodiesterases, enzymes that break down cyclic AMP.  This leads to increased intracellular cAMP levels, promoting smooth muscle relaxation in the airways. It also exhibits some anti-inflammatory properties. Montelukast antagonizes leukotriene receptors, particularly LTD4 receptors, thereby reducing bronchoconstriction, mucus secretion, and airway edema associated with leukotriene activity.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Doxofylline is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentration in 1-2 hours for immediate-release formulations, while sustained-release preparations have longer time to reach peak concentrations. Doxofylline is metabolized in the liver and primarily eliminated via renal excretion. The elimination half-life varies.

Montelukast is rapidly absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentration in 3-4 hours. Food doesn't significantly affect its absorption.  Montelukast is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. It is excreted mainly in bile, with minimal renal elimination. The elimination half-life is typically 2.7 to 5.5 hours in adults.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard dose for adults and adolescents 15 years and older is one tablet containing Doxofylline 400 mg and Montelukast 10 mg, taken orally once daily, usually in the evening for asthma and morning or evening for allergic rhinitis. For patients with both asthma and allergic rhinitis, a single evening dose is recommended.

#### **Children:**

For children younger than 15 years, the dosage should be determined by a pediatrician based on age, weight, and the specific condition.  Montelukast 10 mg tablets are generally not recommended for children under 15. Doxofylline dosage needs adjustment in pediatric population based on weight or body surface area.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustment is usually required for elderly patients unless significant renal or hepatic impairment is present.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustment may be required in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, particularly for doxofylline.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration is needed for patients with cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer disease, and seizure disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Doxofylline + Montelukast is not recommended for acute exacerbations of asthma or COPD.  It is intended for long-term management of these chronic respiratory conditions. In emergency situations like status asthmaticus or severe bronchospasm, short-acting bronchodilators and other appropriate interventions are necessary. Doxofylline + Montelukast is not indicated for specific clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or general ICU use, beyond its role in managing underlying chronic asthma or COPD within those settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments might be needed depending on individual patient responses, the severity of the disease, and the presence of renal or hepatic impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dizziness, fatigue, insomnia, irritation, sore throat, increased heart rate, and flu-like symptoms.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (rash, urticaria, angioedema), neuropsychiatric events (agitation, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation),  and cardiovascular effects (palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

The potential long-term adverse effects of Doxofylline + Montelukast require further investigation. Monitoring for neuropsychiatric effects is especially important with prolonged montelukast use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, significant mood or behavioral changes (including suicidal thoughts or behavior), and severe cardiovascular effects are potentially serious ADRs requiring prompt medical intervention.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to doxofylline, montelukast, or any component of the formulation; acute myocardial infarction; severe hypotension; active peptic ulcer disease; Status epilepticus.


## **Drug Interactions**

Doxofylline + Montelukast may interact with several medications, including:

* Xanthines (theophylline, aminophylline)
* CYP2C8 inhibitors and inducers (gemfibrozil, rifampicin)
* CYP3A4 inhibitors (itraconazole, ketoconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin)
* H2 receptor antagonists (cimetidine, ranitidine)
* Phenytoin
* Allopurinol

Alcohol should be limited as it may enhance drowsiness and other side effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of Doxofylline + Montelukast during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.  It should be used only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus or infant.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Doxofylline: Bronchodilation via phosphodiesterase inhibition. Montelukast: Leukotriene receptor antagonist.
* **Side Effects:** Headache, nausea, dizziness, neuropsychiatric events, allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, acute MI, severe hypotension.
* **Drug Interactions:** Xanthines, CYP2C8 inhibitors/inducers, CYP3A4 inhibitors, H2 antagonists.
