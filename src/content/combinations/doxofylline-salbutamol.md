## **Usage**

Doxofylline + Salbutamol is prescribed for the treatment of reversible obstructive airway diseases, primarily asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  This combination therapy is indicated for the relief of bronchospasm and improvement of lung function in these conditions. It is not intended for the management of acute asthma attacks.

* **Pharmacological Classification:** Bronchodilator (a combination of a xanthine derivative and a beta-2 agonist).

* **Mechanism of Action:** Doxofylline inhibits phosphodiesterase enzymes, increasing intracellular cyclic AMP and relaxing bronchial smooth muscle. It also exhibits some anti-inflammatory activity. Salbutamol, a beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, directly relaxes bronchial smooth muscle.  The combination results in synergistic bronchodilation.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Doxofylline + Salbutamol" represents the generic name, various brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and geographical location. Salbutamol is also referred to as Albuterol, especially in the United States.  Some examples of brand names include Carbasma S, Doxoril Plus, and Gazodox S.

## **How It Works**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Doxofylline acts as a bronchodilator and exhibits mild anti-inflammatory properties. It relaxes the smooth muscles of the airways, reducing bronchospasm and improving airflow. Salbutamol, by stimulating beta-2 adrenergic receptors, also relaxes bronchial smooth muscle and promotes bronchodilation.

* **Pharmacokinetics:** Doxofylline is metabolized in the liver and primarily excreted via the kidneys. It reaches peak serum concentration in approximately 2 hours when administered orally. Salbutamol is also metabolized in the liver and excreted through the kidneys and in feces.

* **Mode of Action:** Doxofylline inhibits phosphodiesterase enzymes, leading to an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP. This, in turn, relaxes the bronchial smooth muscles. Salbutamol directly activates beta-2 adrenergic receptors, also leading to bronchial smooth muscle relaxation.

* **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Doxofylline primarily acts through phosphodiesterase enzyme inhibition. It demonstrates a significantly lower affinity for adenosine receptors compared to theophylline. Salbutamol directly binds to and activates beta-2 adrenergic receptors.

* **Elimination Pathways:** Both Doxofylline and Salbutamol are metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Doxofylline: 400 mg twice or three times daily (BID or TID), with a maximum daily dose of 1200 mg.

Salbutamol: Dosage depends on the administration route (inhalation, nebulization, oral) and the severity of symptoms. Common inhaled doses are 100-200 mcg per puff via metered-dose inhaler (MDI) or dry powder inhaler (DPI), up to four times daily. Oral doses range from 2mg to 8mg three to four times a day.

#### **Children:**

Doxofylline: Limited safety and efficacy data are available for children under 18. Doxofylline use in children is generally not recommended. If necessary, use with caution under specialist supervision. Doses may range from 6-9 mg/kg BID for children under 12, up to 200 mg BID or TID for children over 12. Salbutamol dosage is also dependent on age and the severity of symptoms and is usually 1-2 puffs via MDI or 2.5-5 mg by nebulizer up to four times per day.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Reduce Doxofylline dose to 200 mg BID or TID. Salbutamol: Start with a lower dose, such as 2mg three times a day.


* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Doxofylline dose reduction is recommended. Salbutamol is mostly excreted through urine and should be used with caution and possibly dose reduction.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Doxofylline and Salbutamol dose reduction might be necessary.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider dose adjustments for cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer disease, etc.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The Doxofylline + Salbutamol combination is typically not specifically indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It is generally intended for maintenance therapy of chronic airway diseases.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications should be considered based on individual patient factors such as renal/hepatic impairment, metabolic disorders, concomitant medications, and other relevant clinical conditions.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Headache, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, irritability, insomnia, palpitations, tachycardia, throat irritation, dysphagia, difficulty urinating.

## **Popular Combinations**

Doxofylline is sometimes combined with other bronchodilators, corticosteroids, or mucolytics for enhanced therapeutic effects in managing COPD or asthma.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Evaluate patients for pre-existing medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, hepatic or renal dysfunction, and peptic ulcer disease.
