## **Usage**

Doxycycline is an antibiotic prescribed for various bacterial infections, including respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, sexually transmitted infections (chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis), skin infections, Lyme disease, and certain types of pneumonia. It is also used for malaria prophylaxis and as an adjunct in periodontal disease.  Vitamin C is an antioxidant and is sometimes used in combination with doxycycline. This combination may exhibit synergistic effects, especially against cancer stem cells (CSCs), by inhibiting both mitochondrial biogenesis and glycolysis. However, the clinical significance and widespread use of this combination for infections require further research. Doxycycline is classified as a tetracycline antibiotic.

Doxycycline exerts its antibacterial effect by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. It binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit, blocking the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex. This prevents the addition of amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain and halts protein synthesis, leading to bacterial growth inhibition or death. Vitamin C has not been shown to have a direct impact on doxycycline's antibiotic mechanism.

## **Alternate Names**

Doxycycline is also known as doxycycline hyclate (the salt form most commonly used).  There are several brand names under which doxycycline is marketed, including Vibramycin, Doryx, Acticlate, Atridox, and Doxycin.  Vitamin C is also known as ascorbic acid. This combination does not have a specific international nonproprietary name (INN).

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Doxycycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. This primarily exerts a bacteriostatic effect at clinically achievable concentrations, though it can be bactericidal against certain susceptible organisms at higher concentrations. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that can scavenge free radicals, enhancing the immune response. Studies suggest a synergistic effect of doxycycline and vitamin C against cancer stem cells by targeting both mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Doxycycline is well-absorbed orally, with bioavailability exceeding 90%.  It is widely distributed in tissues, including bone, teeth, and lungs, achieving therapeutic concentrations in most body fluids.  Doxycycline undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism and is primarily excreted in the feces via biliary excretion and to a lesser extent in urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 18-22 hours, allowing for once or twice-daily dosing.  Vitamin C is readily absorbed orally and distributed throughout the body. Excess vitamin C is excreted renally.

**Mechanism of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Doxycycline's primary mechanism involves binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit in bacteria. It does not interact with specific receptors or enzymes in human cells in the same way as, for example, receptor antagonists or enzyme inhibitors. However, its activity against matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) has been observed in some studies. The role of this activity in epileptic seizure modulation remains to be fully understood. Vitamin C primarily functions as an antioxidant but can also modulate various cellular pathways, including those involved in energy metabolism. 

**Elimination Pathways:** Doxycycline is primarily eliminated via biliary excretion in feces, with a small fraction excreted unchanged in the urine.  Vitamin C is excreted renally.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The usual initial dose is 200 mg on the first day (100 mg every 12 hours), followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg daily (or 50 mg every 12 hours). For more severe infections, especially chronic urinary tract infections, 100 mg every 12 hours is recommended throughout the treatment period.


#### **Children:** For children over 8 years of age, the dosage is weight-based. Children weighing 45 kg or more should follow adult dosing. Children weighing less than 45 kg require a lower dose. For severe or life-threatening infections (e.g., anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), the recommended dose is 2.2 mg/kg every 12 hours. For less severe infections, the dose is 4.4 mg/kg per day divided into two doses on the first day, followed by 2.2 mg/kg daily.  Doxycycline is generally avoided in children under 8 years due to the risk of tooth discoloration.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are typically required for elderly patients unless there is significant renal or hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustment is generally not necessary as doxycycline is primarily excreted via biliary routes. 
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment may be needed in severe hepatic disease due to potential delayed biliary excretion.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution should be exercised in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or other relevant comorbid conditions, and appropriate monitoring is recommended.


### **Clinical Use Cases**
Doxycycline is not typically the primary antibiotic used in the clinical scenarios mentioned below.  However, it may be used in specific situations where its activity against the suspected pathogen is justified:

* **Intubation:** No specific dosage guidelines for intubation.
* **Surgical Procedures:** May be used for surgical site infection prophylaxis in specific cases.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:**  Not typically indicated.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** May be used to treat specific infections in the ICU, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), based on culture results. 
* **Emergency Situations:**  May be used in emergency situations for specific infections, such as anthrax, but other antibiotics may be preferred.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**  Doxycycline dosage adjustments are generally not required in renal impairment. In hepatic impairment, dose adjustment may be necessary in severe cases.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, photosensitivity, skin rash.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), angioedema,  *Clostridium difficile* associated diarrhea,  hepatotoxicity, intracranial hypertension, pancreatitis.

### **Long-Term Effects:** Tooth discoloration (especially in children under 8 years of age), enamel hypoplasia.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to tetracyclines, pregnancy (especially second and third trimesters), breastfeeding, children under 8 years of age (except in life-threatening situations).



## **Drug Interactions**

Antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, bismuth subsalicylate, iron supplements,  oral contraceptives (may reduce efficacy), warfarin (increased risk of bleeding),  barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine (reduced doxycycline levels).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Doxycycline is contraindicated during pregnancy, especially in the second and third trimesters, due to the risk of fetal harm, including tooth discoloration and skeletal growth retardation. It is also contraindicated during breastfeeding due to the potential for drug excretion in breast milk and subsequent effects on the infant.

## **Drug Profile Summary**


* **Mechanism of Action:**  Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit.

* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, photosensitivity, rash; rarely, severe allergic reactions, *C. difficile* infection, hepatotoxicity.

## **Popular Combinations**

A popular combination in research settings and some clinical practices is doxycycline + vitamin C, which is studied for its synergistic effect against cancer stem cells, though it is not yet standard treatment for any specific infection. Doxycycline is often combined with other antibiotics depending on the specific infection being treated.
