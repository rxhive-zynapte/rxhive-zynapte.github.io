## **Usage**

- This drug is primarily prescribed for the management of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP), often referred to as "morning sickness."  It may also be used to treat hyperemesis gravidarum (HG),  a severe form of NVP characterized by persistent nausea and vomiting leading to dehydration, weight loss, and electrolyte imbalances. Folic acid supplementation supports fetal development.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antiemetic, Antihistamine (Doxylamine), Vitamin Supplement (B6 and Folic acid)

## **Alternate Names**
- Doxylamine Succinate + Pyridoxine Hydrochloride + Folic Acid
- **Brand Names:**  Diclegis (US),  Bonjesta (US), Doxinate (India), Doxylamine-Pyridoxine-Folic Acid (generic)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Doxylamine, an antihistamine, antagonizes H1 receptors in the vestibular system and the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the brain, reducing nausea and vomiting. Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) plays a role in neurotransmitter synthesis, potentially modulating nausea pathways.  Folic acid is crucial for cell growth and development, especially during pregnancy for neural tube development.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Doxylamine is well-absorbed orally and metabolized in the liver. Pyridoxine is also absorbed orally and converted to its active form, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate.  Folic acid is absorbed primarily in the small intestine. All components are likely renally excreted, although precise elimination pathways for doxylamine metabolites need more clinical research.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (For NVP/HG):**
- Initial: Two tablets at bedtime.
- If symptoms persist:  Two tablets at bedtime and one tablet in the morning on Day 2. May increase to a maximum of four tablets daily (1 morning, 1 mid-afternoon, 2 bedtime) as needed. Please note that Diclegis is formulated as delayed-release tablets, and Bonjesta is formulated as extended-release tablets.


#### **Children:** This combination is not recommended for children.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are mentioned in the sources, but caution is advised due to potential for increased sensitivity.
- **Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment:** Exercise caution and consider dosage adjustments. Consult a nephrologist/hepatologist for precise guidance.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in asthma, glaucoma, peptic ulcer, gastrointestinal obstruction, urinary retention, and Vitamin B12 deficiency.

### **Clinical Use Cases (Not applicable for this drug)**  
- The combination of doxylamine, folic acid, and pyridoxine is specifically indicated for NVP/HG. Its use in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations is not relevant.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
- Dosage adjustments are made empirically based on symptom control, starting low and titrating upwards. 


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**
- Drowsiness
- Dizziness
- Dry mouth
- Constipation
- Fatigue
- Headache


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Blurred vision
- Difficulty urinating

## **Contraindications**
- Hypersensitivity to doxylamine, pyridoxine, or folic acid
- Concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)



## **Drug Interactions**
- Alcohol (increased drowsiness)
- CNS depressants (additive sedative effects)
- Anticholinergic drugs (additive anticholinergic effects)
- Folate-rich foods (potential interference with absorption, though data is lacking).




## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
- Generally considered safe for use during pregnancy (FDA Pregnancy Category A for Diclegis, Category B for Vitamin B6 and folic acid).
- Not recommended during breastfeeding due to potential for excretion in breast milk and effects on the infant.
