## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the management of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP), often referred to as morning sickness.  It is particularly useful when symptoms are not adequately controlled by lifestyle modifications or other treatments.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  This is a combination product containing an antihistamine (doxylamine),  vitamin B6 (pyridoxal 5-phosphate), and B vitamins (L-methylfolate calcium and methylcobalamin).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Doxylamine, an antihistamine, antagonizes H1 receptors, blocking the action of histamine, a chemical messenger involved in nausea and vomiting.  Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6), L-methylfolate (active form of folic acid), and methylcobalamin (active form of vitamin B12) help address potential vitamin deficiencies that may exacerbate NVP and support overall maternal health during pregnancy.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific four-component combination. However, the components are sometimes referred to by different names (e.g., pyridoxine for vitamin B6, cobalamin for B12).
- **Brand Names:**  Brand names may vary depending on the region. Some examples include Doxinate XT and Diclectin (Canada).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Doxylamine exerts its antiemetic effect primarily through H1 receptor antagonism in the central nervous system. The B vitamins play essential roles in various metabolic processes, including neurotransmitter synthesis, red blood cell production, and DNA synthesis. They contribute to maternal health and may help alleviate NVP symptoms associated with vitamin deficiency.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Doxylamine is well-absorbed orally. The B vitamins are also absorbed following oral administration.
    - **Metabolism:** Doxylamine is extensively metabolized in the liver. B vitamins undergo metabolic conversion to their active forms.
    - **Elimination:** Doxylamine is primarily excreted in urine. B vitamins are excreted in urine, with some biliary excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** Doxylamine competitively binds to H1 receptors, preventing histamine from binding and exerting its effects.  The B vitamins act as cofactors and substrates in various enzymatic reactions supporting cellular function and metabolic pathways.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- *Doxylamine/Pyridoxine Extended-Release Tablets:* One tablet at bedtime on Day 1. If symptoms persist, one tablet in the morning and one tablet at bedtime on Day 2 (maximum two tablets daily).
