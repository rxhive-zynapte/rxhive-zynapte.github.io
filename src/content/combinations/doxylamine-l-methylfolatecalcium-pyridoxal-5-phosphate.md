## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the treatment of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (NVP), particularly in cases where conservative management has been ineffective.  It is not recommended for other indications without consulting a doctor.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antiemetic, Vitamin Supplement.  Doxylamine is an antihistamine (ethanolamine derivative) with antiemetic properties. Pyridoxal-5-phosphate (vitamin B6) and L-methyl folate (active form of folic acid) are vitamin/nutrient supplements that are essential for metabolic processes and cell synthesis, and are theorized to play a role in reducing NVP.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Doxylamine exerts its antiemetic action by antagonizing H1 histamine receptors, thus blocking histaminergic signaling to the vomiting center in the medulla.  Pyridoxal-5-phosphate and L-methyl folate, while their exact mechanism in alleviating NVP is not fully elucidated, contribute to overall maternal health and fetal development during pregnancy.

## **Alternate Names**

While the combination itself does not have a distinct international nonproprietary name (INN), the components do: Doxylamine succinate, Pyridoxal 5-phosphate, and L-Methylfolate calcium.
- **Brand Names:**  Diclegis®, Bonjesta®, and other regional brand names. Some brands may also include other ingredients.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Doxylamine primarily acts as an H1 receptor antagonist. This action reduces the stimulation of the vomiting center in the brain. Pyridoxal-5-phosphate and L-methyl folate act as cofactors and substrates in crucial metabolic pathways.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** The precise pharmacokinetic parameters (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of the combined formulation have not been completely characterized in the provided sources. Doxylamine is known to undergo hepatic metabolism and primarily renal excretion. Pyridoxal 5-phosphate also undergoes hepatic metabolism, while L-methylfolate is known to be involved in enterohepatic circulation.
- **Mode of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation**: Doxylamine competitively binds to H1 histamine receptors. No specific enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation has been described in the provided source, other than its interaction with the histaminergic system.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Doxylamine is largely excreted in the urine. Both Pyridoxal 5-phosphate and L-methylfolate are eliminated through various routes, including renal and hepatic pathways.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Initial Dose:** Two tablets at bedtime on Day 1.
- **Subsequent Dosing:** If symptoms persist on Day 2, take two tablets at bedtime and then commence three tablets on Day 3 (one tablet in the morning and two tablets at bedtime). If symptoms persist on Day 4, increase to four tablets daily (one tablet in the morning, one mid-afternoon, and two at bedtime).

#### **Children:**  The safety and efficacy in children have not been established. This combination is not recommended for pediatric use.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** While no specific dosage adjustments for the elderly are mentioned in provided sources, due to potential age-related decline in renal and hepatic function, caution should be exercised, and monitoring is recommended.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be needed based on the degree of impairment. Consult nephrology specialists and available resources to guide dose adjustment. 
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary. Consult hepatology specialists and available resources to guide dose adjustment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Exercise caution in patients with asthma/COPD, cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, peptic ulcer disease, bladder neck obstruction, or depression.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication is primarily used for NVP. The provided sources do not recommend use for Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU use, or Emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage should be individualized based on patient response and the presence of comorbidities or organ dysfunction. Always reassess the need for continued therapy.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe ADRs such as seizures, confusion, shortness of breath, or allergic reactions require immediate medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication
- Concurrent use of Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)


## **Drug Interactions**

- Alcohol (increased drowsiness/dizziness)
- Other antihistamines (additive sedative effects)
- Anti-anxiety medications (additive sedative effects)
- MAOIs (potentially serious interactions)
- Sedative-hypnotics (additive sedative effects)
- Drugs that affect liver enzymes (consult resources for detailed list to evaluate potential changes in metabolism of components).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Generally considered safe for use during pregnancy for the management of NVP. However, always discuss potential risks and benefits with the patient.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Not recommended during breastfeeding as doxylamine is excreted in breast milk and may cause drowsiness or irritability in infants.  If prescribed, advise patients to discontinue breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Doxylamine: H1 receptor antagonist. Pyridoxal-5-phosphate & L-methyl folate: Vitamins/Nutrients.
