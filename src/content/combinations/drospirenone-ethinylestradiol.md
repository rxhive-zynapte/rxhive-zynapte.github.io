## **Usage**

Drospirenone + Ethinyl Estradiol is primarily prescribed for:
* **Contraception (preventing pregnancy):** It is a combined oral contraceptive (COC) containing synthetic forms of estrogen (ethinyl estradiol) and progestin (drospirenone).
* **Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD):**  Used to manage the emotional and physical symptoms of PMDD, a severe form of premenstrual syndrome (PMS).
* **Moderate Acne Vulgaris:** In females at least 14 years of age who have started menstruating.

**Pharmacological Classification:**
Combined Oral Contraceptive; Progestin and Estrogen Combination

**Mechanism of Action:** Primarily prevents pregnancy by suppressing ovulation.  Secondarily alters the cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to enter the uterus and hinders implantation by changing the uterine lining.  Drospirenone also has anti-mineralocorticoid properties.


## **Alternate Names**

This medication is a combination of two active ingredients: Drospirenone and Ethinyl Estradiol. There isn't a single alternate generic name. However, various brand names exist.

**Brand Names:**
Yasmin, Yaz, Gianvi, Loryna, Ocella, Syeda, Vestura, Nikki, Zarah, etc. (Note: Brand names may vary by region.)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Ethinyl Estradiol:**  Synthetic estrogen that primarily suppresses the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland, thus inhibiting ovulation. It also influences the endometrial lining and cervical mucus.
* **Drospirenone:** Synthetic progestin with anti-mineralocorticoid and anti-androgenic activity. Contributes to preventing ovulation, thickening cervical mucus, and altering the endometrium.  Its anti-mineralocorticoid effects can be beneficial for managing PMDD symptoms like bloating and water retention.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Both components are rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Peak serum levels are generally reached within 1-2 hours. Food may slightly delay absorption, but this does not significantly impact overall effectiveness.
* **Metabolism:** Ethinyl estradiol undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver and intestines, primarily by CYP3A4. Drospirenone is also metabolized in the liver but does not involve the CYP system to the same extent.
* **Elimination:** Metabolites of both hormones are excreted mainly in urine and, to a lesser extent, in feces.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Children:**
