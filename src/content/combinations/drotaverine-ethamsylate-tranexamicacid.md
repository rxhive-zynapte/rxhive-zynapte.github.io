      How does Drotaverine + Ethamsylate + Tranexamic Acid work to reduce heavy
      menstrual bleeding?**


      **A:** Drotaverine relaxes the uterine muscles, reducing cramping pain.
      Ethamsylate enhances platelet function and capillary resistance, while

## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the management of menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) and associated pain.  It combines the antispasmodic action of drotaverine with the hemostatic effects of ethamsylate and tranexamic acid.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This drug combines medications from three classifications:
    - Drotaverine: Antispasmodic
    - Ethamsylate: Hemostatic
    - Tranexamic acid: Antifibrinolytic


- **Mechanism of Action:** Drotaverine relaxes smooth muscles in the uterus, alleviating pain from menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea). Ethamsylate enhances platelet adhesion and reduces capillary bleeding. Tranexamic acid inhibits fibrinolysis, preventing the breakdown of blood clots, thereby further reducing bleeding.

## **Alternate Names**

While no specific international non-proprietary name exists for this combination product, it may be referred to as a "Drotaverine, Ethamsylate, and Tranexamic acid combination."

- **Brand Names:**  Ethamax TD, Track D are two examples of the brand names used for this combination. Other brand names might exist.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Drotaverine, a phosphodiesterase IV inhibitor, relaxes uterine smooth muscles. Ethamsylate increases capillary resistance and promotes platelet adhesion.  Tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic, reversibly blocks lysine binding sites on plasminogen, preventing its activation to plasmin, and thereby inhibiting fibrinolysis and stabilizing clots.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Drotaverine:** Well absorbed orally, undergoes hepatic metabolism, primarily by CYP2D6.
    - **Ethamsylate:** Partially metabolized, primarily in the liver.
    - **Tranexamic Acid:**  Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine with a plasma half-life of approximately 3 hours.

- **Mode of Action:**
    - **Drotaverine:** Inhibits phosphodiesterase enzyme, increasing intracellular cAMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation.
    - **Ethamsylate:** Works by increasing capillary endothelial resistance and improving platelet aggregation.
    - **Tranexamic Acid:**  Reversibly binds to lysine receptor sites on plasminogen, inhibiting plasmin formation and thus preventing fibrinolysis.

- **Elimination Pathways:**
    - Drotaverine: Primarily hepatic metabolism.
    - Ethamsylate:  Partially hepatic metabolism with renal excretion.
    - Tranexamic Acid: Predominantly renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** One tablet (containing 80mg Drotaverine, 250mg Ethamsylate, and 250mg Tranexamic acid) two to three times daily, typically starting on the first day of menstruation and continuing for up to five days.

#### **Children:** This combination is generally not recommended for use in children. The safety and effectiveness in pediatric populations have not been well established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary depending on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is recommended, especially for tranexamic acid.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, although specific dosage adjustments may not be routinely necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Patients with a history of thromboembolic events should use this combination with caution.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Thromboembolic events (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke).  Vision changes (requiring immediate ophthalmological evaluation). Allergic reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects**

The long-term effects of continuous or repeated use of this combination have not been fully evaluated.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
