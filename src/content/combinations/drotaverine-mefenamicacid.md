## **Usage**

Drotaverine + Mefenamic Acid is prescribed for the relief of pain and muscle spasms, particularly in conditions involving smooth muscles.  It is commonly used to treat:

* Abdominal pain and cramps
* Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea)
* Renal colic
* Functional bowel disorders
* Migraine headaches
* Muscle pain
* Pain after surgery
* Heavy bleeding during periods


**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Drotaverine: Antispasmodic
* Mefenamic Acid: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)


**Mechanism of Action:**

Drotaverine acts as a direct smooth muscle relaxant by inhibiting phosphodiesterase enzyme, thereby reducing intracellular calcium levels and muscle contractions. Mefenamic acid inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, reducing pain and inflammation.

## **Alternate Names**

No commonly used alternate generic names exist. Brand names include MIFESTA-DR and Genericart Drotaverine + Mefenamic Acid. Regional variations in brand names might exist.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Drotaverine directly relaxes smooth muscles, reducing spasms. Mefenamic acid reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, particularly COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Both drugs are absorbed orally.  Mefenamic acid is highly protein-bound and metabolized in the liver. Drotaverine is also metabolized in the liver. Elimination pathways for both drugs are primarily through hepatic (liver) and renal (kidney) excretion. More research is needed to establish specific CYP enzyme involvement and details on their pharmacokinetics.

**Mode of Action:** Drotaverine inhibits phosphodiesterase enzyme, decreasing intracellular calcium, leading to smooth muscle relaxation.  Mefenamic acid inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, blocking prostaglandin synthesis, which mediates pain and inflammation.

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation**:  Drotaverine: Phosphodiesterase inhibition. Mefenamic Acid: COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme inhibition.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One tablet (typically 80mg Drotaverine + 250mg Mefenamic Acid or 80mg Drotaverine + 500mg Mefenamic Acid), taken 2-3 times daily, with or after food. The maximum dose is typically one tablet of the higher strength formulation every six hours.

#### **Children:**

Not typically recommended for children under 12.  For children over 12, the dosage and use must be determined by a doctor.  Safety and efficacy have not been established in younger children. For children 6-12, some guidelines suggest  ¼ or ½ tablet, 1-2 times daily for lower strengths and ½ or 1 tablet, 1 - 2 times daily for higher strengths.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage should be adjusted based on renal and hepatic function. Lower doses are generally recommended.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dosage adjustment is necessary based on creatinine clearance. In severe renal impairment, contraindicated.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dose adjustment may be needed. Monitor liver function tests.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, asthma, peptic ulcers, porphyria, or bleeding problems. Consider potential drug interactions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations is not specifically established for this combination and should be individualized based on the patient's condition and the reason for administration. The drug is primarily used for pain and spasm relief in less acute settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on renal and hepatic function, age, and comorbidities. No specific guidelines for metabolic disorders or genetic polymorphisms are available for this specific combination.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Potential long-term effects are not well-established for this combination. Prolonged NSAID use can increase the risk of gastrointestinal issues and cardiovascular complications.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, gastrointestinal bleeding, liver or kidney damage, cardiovascular events require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

## **Drug Interactions**

* Other NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen): Increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects
* Anticoagulants (warfarin): Increased bleeding risk
* Antihypertensives: May reduce effectiveness
* Lithium, Fluoxetine, Sertraline, Duloxetine (antidepressants): Potential for increased side effects
* Digoxin: May increase digoxin levels

* Mifepristone: May reduce effectiveness
* Alcohol: Increased risk of dizziness, drowsiness, and gastrointestinal bleeding


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy Safety Category:** Not recommended during pregnancy, especially the third trimester, due to potential risks to the fetus (premature closure of ductus arteriosus).

**Breastfeeding:** Mefenamic acid is excreted in breast milk.  The combination is not recommended during breastfeeding due to potential risks to the neonate.
