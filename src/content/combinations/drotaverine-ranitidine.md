## **Usage**

Drotaverine + Ranitidine is prescribed for the relief of spasms and pain associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome and biliary dyskinesia.  It is also used to treat peptic ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Drotaverine: Antispasmodic
* Ranitidine: H2 receptor antagonist

**Mechanism of Action:**

Drotaverine is a direct smooth muscle relaxant, primarily acting on the gastrointestinal tract. Ranitidine decreases stomach acid production by blocking histamine H2 receptors in the stomach lining. The combination provides both antispasmodic and antacid effects.

## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for the combination product itself. However, the individual components may be known by other names.

**Brand Names:**  Ranispas-DV, Averine R


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

Drotaverine directly inhibits phosphodiesterase activity, increasing intracellular cyclic AMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation. Ranitidine competitively inhibits histamine at H2 receptors of gastric parietal cells, reducing gastric acid secretion.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

Drotaverine is well-absorbed orally.  Ranitidine is also absorbed orally, with bioavailability reduced by food. Both drugs are metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily through the kidneys. Specific details on CYP enzyme involvement are not readily available for this drug.

**Mode of Action:** Drotaverine acts directly on smooth muscle, whereas ranitidine acts on H2 receptors in the stomach.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**

* Drotaverine: Phosphodiesterase inhibition
* Ranitidine: Competitive inhibition of histamine at H2 receptors.

**Elimination Pathways:**

Both are primarily excreted renally, with some hepatic metabolism. More detailed pathways and CYP enzyme information is not available.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Oral: One tablet (Drotaverine 40mg + Ranitidine 150mg) two to three times a day.  Dosages may vary based upon the indication and severity of symptoms.

#### **Children:**

Information regarding specific pediatric dosing for this fixed-dose combination is limited. Drotaverine dosing is sometimes based on age, with adjustments as needed. Ranitidine pediatric dosing is generally weight-based. Consult specialized pediatric resources for accurate dosing guidelines.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment may be needed due to decreased renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Ranitidine dose reduction is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised; dose adjustments may be needed for both drugs.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient conditions and adjust accordingly.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU. Ranitidine alone, especially in IV form, might be utilized for stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill patients. However, drotaverine is not typically employed in those situations.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are based on individual patient conditions, especially renal and hepatic function.  Consult a specialist for complex cases or comorbidities.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Headache, dizziness, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Rarely, allergic reactions including skin rash, itching or swelling, and difficulty breathing.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Limited data is available on the long-term effects.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Report any suspected ADRs promptly to the appropriate authorities.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to either drotaverine or ranitidine.  Porphyria (for drotaverine). Severe renal or hepatic impairment. Use cautiously in pregnancy and breastfeeding.

## **Drug Interactions**

Antacids may reduce the absorption of ranitidine. Drotaverine can potentiate the effects of levodopa. Ranitidine may interact with drugs metabolized by the liver.  Consult a comprehensive drug interaction resource for a complete list.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Ranitidine is excreted in breast milk. Drotaverine's effects during these periods are not well-studied.  Consult a specialist before prescribing.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Drotaverine: smooth muscle relaxant, Ranitidine: H2 receptor antagonist
* **Side Effects:** Headache, dizziness, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, porphyria, severe organ impairment
* **Drug Interactions:** Antacids, levodopa, other hepatic metabolism drugs
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use cautiously under specialist guidance.
* **Dosage:** Adults: One tablet two-three times a day. Individual adjustments necessary.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor renal and hepatic function, especially in patients with pre-existing conditions.


## **Popular Combinations**


This fixed-dose combination itself is a popular pairing for addressing abdominal pain with an acid component.


## **Precautions**

Assess for allergies and pre-existing conditions. Exercise caution in special populations.
