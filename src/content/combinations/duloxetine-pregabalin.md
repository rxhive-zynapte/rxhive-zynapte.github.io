## **Usage**

Duloxetine + Pregabalin is prescribed for the treatment of:

*   **Diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain:** This is a type of nerve damage that can occur in people with diabetes, causing pain in the extremities.
*   **Fibromyalgia:** This is a chronic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory, and mood issues.
*   **Neuropathic pain:** This refers to pain caused by damage or disease affecting the somatosensory nervous system.

**Pharmacological classification:**

*   Pregabalin: Anticonvulsant, analgesic, gabapentinoid
*   Duloxetine: Antidepressant, Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI)

**Mechanism of action:**

Pregabalin works by binding to the alpha-2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system. This action reduces the release of several neurotransmitters, including glutamate, noradrenaline, and substance P, which are involved in pain transmission.  Duloxetine inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, thereby increasing their concentrations in the synaptic cleft. This increase in neurotransmitter levels is thought to contribute to its analgesic effect in neuropathic pain. The combination of these two mechanisms provides a synergistic effect in managing chronic pain conditions.


## **Alternate Names**

This drug combination does not have an official international nonproprietary name (INN). It is typically referred to by the names of its constituent drugs.

**Brand names:**  DULOXTIME PREGA 30/75

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Pregabalin reduces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters involved in pain signaling. Duloxetine increases the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine, which modulate pain perception and mood.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Both drugs are well-absorbed orally.
*   **Metabolism:** Pregabalin is not extensively metabolized. Duloxetine is primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 enzymes.
*   **Elimination:** Pregabalin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Duloxetine is eliminated through both renal and hepatic pathways.


**Mode of action:** Pregabalin binds to the alpha-2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, reducing calcium influx and neurotransmitter release. Duloxetine inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake transporters, increasing their synaptic concentrations.


**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Pregabalin binds to alpha-2-delta subunits. Duloxetine inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake.


**Elimination pathways:** Pregabalin through renal excretion. Duloxetine through renal and hepatic pathways, involving CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 enzymes.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Initial: Pregabalin 75 mg + Duloxetine 30 mg once daily.  May increase to Pregabalin 75 mg + Duloxetine 30 mg twice daily based on response and tolerability.
Maximum: Pregabalin 600 mg/day and Duloxetine 120 mg/day.

#### **Children:**

Not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age. The safety and efficacy have not been established in this population.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Initiate at lower doses and titrate cautiously.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Pregabalin dose adjustment is necessary for moderate to severe renal impairment. Duloxetine should be avoided in severe renal impairment and end-stage renal disease.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Duloxetine is contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment. Pregabalin dose adjustment might be needed.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution and adjust dosage as needed.  Close monitoring is recommended for patients with a history of suicidal ideation, seizures, mania, bipolar disorder, or glaucoma.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of duloxetine and pregabalin is not typically used in acute clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.  It is primarily intended for chronic pain management.  In these acute settings, other medications are preferred for managing pain, sedation, and other relevant symptoms.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on patient response, tolerability, and renal or hepatic function.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, constipation, headache, dry mouth, increased sweating, loss of appetite, dizziness, and burning sensation.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Suicidal thoughts, serotonin syndrome, hepatotoxicity, mania, syncope, SIADH, hyponatremia, allergic reactions, bleeding disorders, and angle-closure glaucoma.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential long-term effects are not fully characterized but may include dependence, withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation, and other chronic complications.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs may include severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to either drug, concomitant use of MAOIs, uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma, severe renal impairment (duloxetine), and hepatic impairment (duloxetine).

## **Drug Interactions**

CYP450 interactions (duloxetine), alcohol, CNS depressants, anticoagulants, antihypertensives, and OTC drugs.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
