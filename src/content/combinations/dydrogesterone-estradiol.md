## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Dydrogesterone + Estradiol is prescribed for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in postmenopausal women experiencing symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, and sleep disturbances. It is also used to prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Additionally, some formulations are used for the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause and for dysfunctional uterine bleeding.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), estrogen and progestogen combination.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Estradiol, a form of estrogen, replaces the declining estrogen levels in the body during menopause, alleviating menopausal symptoms. Dydrogesterone, a progestogen, counteracts the effects of estrogen on the uterine lining, reducing the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.

## **Alternate Names**

- No commonly used alternate generic names.
- **Brand Names:** Femoston, Femoston Conti,  Femoston-Mini. (Note: Brand names can vary by region.)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Estradiol binds to estrogen receptors throughout the body, producing estrogenic effects such as reducing menopausal symptoms and maintaining bone density. Dydrogesterone binds to progesterone receptors in the uterus, counteracting the proliferative effects of estrogen on the endometrium.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - *Absorption:* Both estradiol and dydrogesterone are well-absorbed orally. Estradiol reaches peak plasma concentration in 1.5-2 hours, while dydrogesterone reaches peak concentration in 0.5-2.5 hours. The main active metabolite of dydrogesterone, 20α-dihydrodydrogesterone (DHD), peaks at approximately 1.5 hours. Dydrogesterone has an absolute bioavailability of 28%.
    - *Distribution:* Estradiol is widely distributed and has high concentrations in target organs. It also enters breast milk.  Estradiol is 98-99% plasma protein bound, primarily to albumin and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG).  Dydrogesterone and its metabolite are >90% bound to plasma proteins.
    - *Metabolism:* Estradiol is primarily metabolized in the liver to estrone and estriol, partly by CYP3A4 enzymes. It undergoes enterohepatic recirculation. Dydrogesterone is rapidly metabolized, primarily to DHD, its main active metabolite. Dydrogesterone metabolites retain the parent compound's 4,6-diene-3-one configuration and lack 17α-hydroxylation, which explains its lack of estrogenic and androgenic effects. DHD reaches significantly higher plasma concentrations than dydrogesterone itself after oral administration.
    - *Elimination:*  The elimination pathways of both drugs and their metabolites are primarily through hepatic metabolism and subsequent renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

#### **Children:** Not applicable; this medication is for postmenopausal women.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Standard adult dosing applies, but close monitoring is recommended.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised, especially in severe renal impairment. Dose adjustments may be needed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in active or chronic liver disease or a history of liver disease as long as liver function tests haven't returned to normal.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution in patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiac dysfunction, asthma, uterine fibroids, endometriosis, migraine, epilepsy, and other conditions.  Individualized assessment is required.

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Increased risk of breast cancer, endometrial cancer, and ovarian cancer with prolonged use, especially with higher doses.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

## **Drug Interactions**

- CYP450 enzyme inducers (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, rifabutin, nevirapine, efavirenz) can increase the metabolism and reduce the efficacy of estradiol and dydrogesterone.
- Ritonavir and nelfinavir, despite being CYP3A4 inhibitors, can exhibit inducing properties with steroid hormones.
- St. John's wort can induce metabolism.
- Estradiol can increase plasma levels of certain drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, including tacrolimus, ciclosporin, fentanyl, and theophylline.
- Alcohol can increase the risk of breast cancer.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Contraindicated in pregnancy. If pregnancy occurs during treatment, discontinue immediately.  May cause fetal harm.
