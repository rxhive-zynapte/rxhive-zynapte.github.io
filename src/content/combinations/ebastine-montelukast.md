## **Usage**

Ebastine + Montelukast is prescribed for the management of symptoms associated with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis (hay fever) in adults and children over 12 years of age. It is also indicated for the prevention of asthma exacerbations and the control of asthma symptoms.  Additionally, it can provide relief from symptoms of chronic idiopathic urticaria (hives).

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination medication includes a second-generation antihistamine (Ebastine) and a leukotriene receptor antagonist (Montelukast).

- **Mechanism of Action:** Ebastine selectively blocks H1 histamine receptors, preventing histamine-mediated allergic symptoms. Montelukast blocks leukotriene D4 receptors, reducing bronchoconstriction, inflammation, and mucus secretion in the airways.

## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination. However, various brand names are used for marketing.

- **Brand Names:**  Examples include Ebal M, Ebast M, EBAST M, Montevac EBS, EBAGRIP â€“ M. (Note: Brand names can vary by region).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ebastine reduces histamine-mediated vascular permeability, itching, sneezing, and rhinorrhea. Montelukast inhibits leukotriene-induced bronchoconstriction and inflammation in the airways.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Ebastine is rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolized to its active metabolite, carebastine, with a long half-life (about 20 hours). Montelukast is also rapidly absorbed, extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 enzymes, and primarily excreted in bile.

- **Mode of Action:** Ebastine competitively antagonizes H1 receptors, while Montelukast competitively antagonizes cysteinyl leukotriene type-1 (CysLT1) receptors.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Ebastine's metabolite, carebastine, is eliminated predominantly through biliary/fecal excretion. Montelukast is primarily excreted in bile.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One tablet (Ebastine 10 mg + Montelukast 10 mg) orally once daily. It can be taken in the morning or evening for allergic rhinitis, but evening administration is preferred for asthma.


#### **Children:**

For children aged 12 years and older, the adult dose applies. This combination is not typically recommended for children under 12.  Refer to individual drug dosing guidelines (Ebastine and Montelukast) for younger children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustment is generally required.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Monitoring of kidney function may be necessary.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Monitoring of liver function may be necessary.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and other conditions.  Individualized dose adjustments may be needed based on specific comorbidities.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Ebastine + Montelukast is not specifically indicated for use in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU care, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments might be necessary based on patient-specific factors, such as renal or hepatic dysfunction, comorbid conditions, or concomitant medications. Close monitoring and individualized adjustments are crucial.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
