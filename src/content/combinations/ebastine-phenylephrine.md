## **Usage**

Ebastine + Phenylephrine is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and the common cold.  It helps relieve symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, watery eyes, and itching.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Ebastine: Second-generation antihistamine (H1 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist).
* Phenylephrine: Decongestant (α1-adrenergic receptor agonist).

**Mechanism of Action:** Ebastine works by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical released by the body during allergic reactions.  Phenylephrine constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.

## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination. However, it's important to note that numerous brand names exist under which this combination is marketed in different regions.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ebastine competes with histamine for binding to H1 receptors, primarily in peripheral tissues, thus reducing histamine's effects like vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and smooth muscle contraction. Phenylephrine stimulates α1-adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction, which reduces nasal congestion.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Ebastine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4.  Its major active metabolite is carebastine. Both ebastine and carebastine contribute to the antihistaminic effect. Phenylephrine is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but has limited bioavailability due to first-pass metabolism.  It is primarily metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the intestine and liver. Both drugs are eliminated primarily through renal excretion.


**Mode of Action:**  Ebastine and carebastine act as inverse agonists or antagonists at the H1 receptor, stabilizing the receptor in its inactive conformation. This prevents histamine from binding and triggering downstream signaling pathways associated with allergic symptoms. Phenylephrine acts as an agonist at α1-adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle, leading to vasoconstriction.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Ebastine and carebastine bind to H1 receptors. Phenylephrine binds to α1-adrenergic receptors. Phenylephrine is metabolized by MAO.


**Elimination Pathways:** Ebastine is metabolized by CYP3A4 in the liver. Both ebastine and its metabolites are eliminated primarily through renal excretion. Phenylephrine is metabolized by MAO and excreted mainly in the urine.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  10 mg Ebastine + 10 mg Phenylephrine once daily.

#### **Children (12 years and older):**  10 mg Ebastine + 10 mg Phenylephrine once daily.
**Children (under 12 years):** Not generally recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and adjust based on tolerability and clinical response.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary. Consult current guidelines and clinical judgment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advised. Dose adjustment may be required. Consult latest recommendations. 
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with hypertension, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, or prostatic hypertrophy.  Close monitoring is recommended.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of Ebastine + Phenylephrine is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its primary use is for outpatient management of allergic rhinitis and common cold symptoms.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on age, renal and hepatic function, and other comorbid conditions as outlined above. Always consider patient-specific factors.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
* Drowsiness
* Headache
* Dry mouth
* Nausea
* Dizziness


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Tachycardia
* Palpitations
* Hypertension
* Hallucinations


### **Long-Term Effects:**

No significant long-term effects have been reported with typical use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Serious ADRs are rare but can include severe allergic reactions and cardiovascular effects.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to ebastine, phenylephrine, or any component of the formulation.
* Severe hypertension

## **Drug Interactions**

* MAOIs: Can cause a hypertensive crisis.
* Tricyclic antidepressants:  May enhance anticholinergic effects.
* Beta-blockers: May lead to paradoxical hypertension.
* Other sympathomimetics:  Additive effects may occur.
* Alcohol: May increase drowsiness and other CNS effects.
* Ketoconazole and other CYP3A4 inhibitors: May increase ebastine levels.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy:**  Safety has not been established.  Use only if clearly needed and the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus.

**Breastfeeding:**  It is unknown whether ebastine or phenylephrine are excreted in human milk.  Caution is advised.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
