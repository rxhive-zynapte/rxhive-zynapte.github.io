## **Usage**

- Efonidipine + Metoprolol Succinate is prescribed for the management of hypertension (high blood pressure).
- **Pharmacological Classification:**
    - Efonidipine: Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blocker
    - Metoprolol Succinate: Beta-1 selective adrenergic receptor blocker
- **Mechanism of Action:** Efonidipine blocks both L-type and T-type calcium channels, leading to vasodilation. Metoprolol succinate blocks beta-1 receptors in the heart, decreasing heart rate and contractility. The combined effect lowers blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

- Efonidipine Hydrochloride Ethanolate + S(-) Metoprolol Succinate
- Brand Name: EFNOCAR-MX


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Efonidipine inhibits calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle cells, causing vasodilation and reducing peripheral vascular resistance. Metoprolol selectively blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, reducing heart rate and contractility, thereby decreasing cardiac output.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Efonidipine: Absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver primarily via CYP3A4. It has a bioavailability of ~25% and a half-life of ~4 hours.
    - Metoprolol: Absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentration in 1.5-2 hours. Metabolized primarily by CYP2D6.  The half-life is 3-7 hours. Less than 5% is excreted unchanged in the urine.
- **Elimination:** Both drugs are primarily metabolized in the liver, and their metabolites are excreted mainly through the kidneys.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: One tablet of Efonidipine 40 mg + Metoprolol Succinate 25 mg once daily.
- The dose may be increased to a maximum of two tablets per day, depending on blood pressure response.

#### **Children:**

- The safety and efficacy have not been established in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. It is not recommended for pediatric use.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate therapy with caution and monitor closely for adverse effects. Dose adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Exercise caution in patients with severe renal impairment. Close monitoring of renal function is recommended. Dose adjustment might be required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use cautiously in patients with liver impairment. Dosage adjustments may be required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Closely monitor patients with asthma, bronchitis, diabetes, or other cardiovascular conditions, as this medication can exacerbate these conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical use cases, such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations, have not been specifically established for this combination. Dosage should be individualized based on the patient's blood pressure response and overall clinical condition.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, metabolic disorders, or those exhibiting potential drug interactions. Close monitoring and titration are crucial.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Dizziness
- Headache
- Fatigue
- Peripheral edema (swelling in the feet or ankles)
- Flushing

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
- Hypotension (low blood pressure), potentially leading to syncope (fainting)
- Worsening of pre-existing heart conditions
- Bronchospasm in patients with asthma or bronchitis

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic complications from prolonged use have not been extensively studied but may include worsening of underlying cardiovascular diseases if blood pressure is not adequately controlled.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs that necessitate immediate intervention include severe hypotension, bradycardia, and bronchospasm.



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to efonidipine, metoprolol, or any components of the formulation.
- Severe bradycardia or atrioventricular block
- Sick sinus syndrome
- Cardiogenic shock
- Decompensated heart failure
- Severe hepatic impairment


## **Drug Interactions**

- Other antihypertensives (additive effect)
- CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers (may affect efonidipine metabolism)
- CYP2D6 inhibitors (may affect metoprolol metabolism)
- Cimetidine (increases blood concentration of efonidipine)
- Grapefruit juice (increases blood levels of efonidipine)


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Efonidipine + Metoprolol Succinate is generally contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential risks to the fetus or neonate. Metoprolol can cross the placenta and is excreted in breast milk. Consult a physician for alternative safer options.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Efonidipine: Calcium channel blocker causing vasodilation. Metoprolol: Beta-blocker reducing heart rate and contractility.
- **Side Effects:** Dizziness, headache, fatigue, peripheral edema, flushing, bradycardia, hypotension.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe bradycardia or heart block, cardiogenic shock, decompensated heart failure, severe hepatic impairment.
- **Drug Interactions:** Other antihypertensives, CYP3A4/2D6 inhibitors/inducers, cimetidine, grapefruit juice.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
- **Dosage:** Adults: Initially one tablet daily, may increase to two. Children: Not recommended.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, heart rate, ECG.


## **Popular Combinations**(Information not found in provided sources.)


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Pre-screening for allergies, metabolic disorders, and organ dysfunction.
- **Specific Populations:**
    - **Pregnant Women:**  Contraindicated due to risks to the fetus.
    - **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Contraindicated due to the risk of neonatal exposure through breast milk.
    - **Children & Elderly:** Not recommended for children. Use with caution in the elderly.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid alcohol as it may worsen side effects like dizziness and increase blood pressure. Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how this medication affects you, as it may cause dizziness or drowsiness.
