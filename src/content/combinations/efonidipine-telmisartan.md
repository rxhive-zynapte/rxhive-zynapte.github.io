      How does Efonidipine + Telmisartan work to lower blood pressure?**


      **A:** Efonidipine relaxes blood vessels by blocking calcium channels,
      while Telmisartan blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that
      narrows blood vessels.  This combined action lowers blood pressure.

## **Usage**

- Efonidipine + Telmisartan is prescribed for the management of Stage II hypertension (high blood pressure).  It may also help reduce the risks associated with hypertension, such as heart attack, stroke, and angina (chest pain).
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination drug includes two classes: a calcium channel blocker (Efonidipine) and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) (Telmisartan).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Efonidipine works by relaxing the blood vessels, which lessens the heart's workload. Telmisartan blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that constricts blood vessels. The combined effect lowers blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

- While no direct alternate names exist for the combination itself, the individual components are sometimes known by other names.
- **Brand Names:** The combination is marketed under various brand names like Efnocar-T and Efonta-T.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Efonidipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, inhibits calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle cells, causing vasodilation.  Telmisartan, an ARB, blocks the binding of angiotensin II to its receptors, preventing vasoconstriction. This dual action results in a synergistic lowering of blood pressure.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Both drugs are orally administered.  Efonidipine is well-absorbed, metabolized by the liver (CYP3A4 enzyme), and primarily excreted in the feces. Telmisartan also has good oral absorption, undergoes minimal metabolism, and is mainly excreted unchanged in the bile.
- **Mode of Action:** Efonidipine acts on L-type calcium channels, while Telmisartan specifically targets angiotensin II type 1 receptors (AT1 receptors).  The combination doesn't involve enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation as its primary mechanisms.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Efonidipine is primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism and fecal excretion, while Telmisartan is eliminated mainly through biliary excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The usual starting dose is one tablet daily containing 20 mg of Efonidipine and 40 mg of Telmisartan. This may be increased to a maximum of two tablets daily based on blood pressure response. Individual component doses can go up to 80 mg/day.

#### **Children:**

- This combination is not recommended for children as safety and efficacy have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a low dose (20 mg Efonidipine/40 mg Telmisartan) and monitor closely for hypotension. Dosage adjustments should be made cautiously.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised, especially in those with severe renal impairment or on hemodialysis. A lower starting dose might be considered.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advised, particularly with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. Patients should be closely monitored, and dose titration should be gradual.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient factors like congestive heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases when adjusting the dose.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- The provided sources don't list dosage recommendations for specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. The drug is intended for chronic hypertension management.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on patient factors like renal/hepatic function, other medical conditions, and response to therapy. Close monitoring of blood pressure is essential during dose adjustments.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Headache, dizziness, flushing, fatigue, swelling of ankles/feet/hands.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Severe hypotension, allergic reactions, liver dysfunction.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

-  The provided sources do not detail specific long-term side effects.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Contraindicated during pregnancy, especially the second and third trimesters.
- **Fetal Risks:**  May cause fetal harm, including fetotoxicity.
- **Drug excretion in breast milk:** Unknown for the combination, but Telmisartan has been detected in rat milk. Efonidipine should be avoided during breastfeeding.
- **Safer Alternatives:** Other antihypertensive agents with established safety profiles during pregnancy and lactation should be considered.

## **Drug Profile Summary**
