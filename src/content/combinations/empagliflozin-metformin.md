## **Usage**

Empagliflozin + Metformin is prescribed for type 2 diabetes mellitus in conjunction with diet and exercise.  It improves glycemic control in adults and children 10 years and older. Additionally, it is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.  It is also used to lower the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization in patients with heart failure.  It does *not* treat type 1 diabetes.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Combination drug containing a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (empagliflozin) and a biguanide (metformin).

- **Mechanism of Action:** Empagliflozin lowers blood glucose by increasing glucose excretion through the urine. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.


## **Alternate Names**

- **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Empagliflozin/Metformin Hydrochloride
- **Brand Names:** Synjardy, Synjardy XR, Jardiamet


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Empagliflozin acts on SGLT2 in the kidneys to prevent glucose reabsorption, thus increasing urinary glucose excretion.  Metformin works through multiple mechanisms to improve glycemic control without stimulating insulin secretion.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - **Empagliflozin:**  Rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentration occurs about 1.5 hours post-dose. Primarily metabolized by glucuronidation. Excreted via urine and feces.
    - **Metformin:** Absorbed slowly and incompletely from the gastrointestinal tract. Not metabolized in the liver. Excreted unchanged primarily by the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:** Empagliflozin inhibits SGLT2 in the renal proximal tubule.  Metformin's precise mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is known to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Empagliflozin specifically inhibits SGLT2.  Metformin does not bind to receptors but acts through intracellular pathways.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Empagliflozin is eliminated via renal and hepatic routes (urine and feces). Metformin undergoes renal excretion unchanged in the urine.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Immediate-Release:** The starting dose is typically 5 mg empagliflozin/500 mg metformin twice daily or 5 mg empagliflozin/1000 mg metformin twice daily, taken with food. The dose can be titrated up as needed and tolerated to a maximum of 12.5 mg empagliflozin/1000 mg metformin twice daily (25 mg empagliflozin/ 2000 mg metformin total daily dose).
- **Extended-Release:** The starting dose is typically 10 mg empagliflozin/1000 mg metformin once daily, taken with food. The dose can be titrated up to a maximum of 25 mg empagliflozin/ 2000 mg metformin once daily.

#### **Children (10 years and older):**

Dosage must be individualized based on the patient's current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability, not to exceed the maximum daily dosage of 25 mg empagliflozin and 2000 mg metformin. Administer twice daily with meals. Gradually escalate the dose to reduce gastrointestinal side effects.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Begin with a lower dose and titrate cautiously due to age-related decline in renal function and increased risk of volume depletion.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m²). Use with caution in mild renal impairment. Dose adjustments or discontinuation may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution as metformin accumulation can occur.  Empagliflozin is primarily metabolized by glucuronidation, so hepatic impairment may not significantly affect its pharmacokinetics, but close monitoring is still recommended. 
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful assessment and dose adjustments are necessary for patients with heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, or other conditions that may predispose to volume depletion or lactic acidosis. 


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of empagliflozin + metformin in specific medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations should be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration patient-specific factors and potential risks and benefits.  Dose adjustments or temporary discontinuation may be necessary depending on the clinical situation and renal function.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary based on renal function, tolerability, and glycemic control.  Temporarily discontinue before procedures involving iodinated contrast media.
