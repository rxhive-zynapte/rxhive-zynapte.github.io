## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Emtricitabine + Tenofovir Alafenamide is prescribed in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older with body weight at least 35 kg). It is also indicated for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of HIV-1 infection in individuals at high risk.  It is not indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antiretroviral, Nucleoside/Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NRTI).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Both emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide are nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors. They are phosphorylated intracellularly to their active metabolites, which compete with natural substrates and incorporate into viral DNA, causing chain termination.  This inhibits the reverse transcription of viral RNA into DNA, thereby blocking HIV-1 replication.

## **Alternate Names**

- Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate
- FTC/TAF
- **Brand Name:** DescovyÂ®


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide interfere with viral replication within infected cells.  The active metabolites compete with natural substrates and get incorporated into the growing viral DNA chain, causing its termination.  This prevents the formation of new HIV-1 virions. Emtricitabine's active form is emtricitabine triphosphate, and tenofovir alafenamide's active form is tenofovir diphosphate.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Tenofovir alafenamide is a prodrug that is rapidly hydrolyzed to tenofovir after oral administration.  Both drugs are well absorbed.
    - **Metabolism:** Tenofovir alafenamide is metabolized to tenofovir.  Emtricitabine is minimally metabolized.
    - **Elimination:** Both drugs are primarily excreted renally, with a small amount excreted in the feces.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (HIV-1 Treatment):**

- 200 mg emtricitabine/25 mg tenofovir alafenamide orally once daily with or without food.

#### **Adults (PrEP):**

- 200 mg emtricitabine/25 mg tenofovir alafenamide orally once daily with or without food.

#### **Children (HIV-1 Treatment, age 12 years and older and weighing at least 35 kg):**

- 200 mg emtricitabine/25 mg tenofovir alafenamide orally once daily with or without food.

#### **Children (PrEP, age 12 years and older and weighing at least 35 kg):**
- 200 mg emtricitabine/25 mg tenofovir alafenamide orally once daily.

#### **Children (PrEP, weighing less than 35 kg):** Use and dose must be determined by a doctor. Specific recommendations for children based on weight brackets:
- 25kg to <35kg: 200mg/25mg once daily.
- 14kg to <25kg: 120mg/15mg once daily.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is generally required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary.  Not recommended for creatinine clearance (CrCl) below 30 mL/min for treatment.  For CrCl 15 to <30 mL/min: Not recommended for treatment. CrCl <15 mL/min on hemodialysis: One tablet once daily on hemodialysis days, after completion. Consult specific guidance.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No dosage adjustment is generally required for mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Assess for potential drug interactions and adjust dosages as needed.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to emtricitabine, tenofovir alafenamide, or any component of the formulation.
- Severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min).
- Coadministration with other medications containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Drugs that induce P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or CYP3A4 may reduce tenofovir alafenamide concentrations.
- Drugs that inhibit P-gp may increase tenofovir alafenamide concentrations.
- Coadministration with other nephrotoxic drugs may increase the risk of renal impairment.
- Some examples include: rifampin, rifabutin, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, St. John's wort, atazanavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and high-dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Insufficient data available on tenofovir alafenamide in pregnant women to inform a drug-related risk.  Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has shown no increased risk of birth defects in limited studies.  Consult latest guidance and consider risks and benefits.
- **Breastfeeding:** Not recommended due to the potential for HIV-1 transmission through breast milk. Data shows components of the drug being present in human milk.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
