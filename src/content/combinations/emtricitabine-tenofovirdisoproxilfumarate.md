      Can I drink alcohol while taking this medication?**

      **A:**  Alcohol is not known to directly interact with it, but excessive
      alcohol can damage the liver and kidneys, which may exacerbate the
      medication’s side effects.  Moderate alcohol consumption might be
      acceptable, but discuss this with your doctor.

## **Usage**

- Emtricitabine + Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is prescribed for:
    - **Treatment of HIV-1 infection:** Used in combination with other antiretroviral agents in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 17 kg.
    - **Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP):**  Reduces the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 in at-risk adults and adolescents weighing 35 kg or more, in conjunction with safer sex practices.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Nucleoside/Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NRTI/NtRTI)
- **Mechanism of Action:** These are two nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).  They act by inhibiting the reverse transcriptase enzyme, essential for HIV replication. This inhibition disrupts the viral life cycle by interfering with reverse transcription of viral RNA into DNA, thereby blocking integration of the viral genetic material into the host cell's DNA.


## **Alternate Names**
- **Generic Name:**  Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
- **Brand Name:** Truvada, and various generics.



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Emtricitabine and Tenofovir are phosphorylated intracellularly to their active metabolites, emtricitabine triphosphate and tenofovir diphosphate. These metabolites compete with natural substrates, resulting in the termination of the DNA chain during reverse transcription, thereby disrupting HIV replication.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is a prodrug rapidly absorbed and hydrolyzed to tenofovir. Bioavailability is increased when taken with food. Emtricitabine is readily absorbed.
    - **Metabolism:** Emtricitabine is minimally metabolized by the liver. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is hydrolyzed to its active component, tenofovir.
    - **Elimination:** Both drugs are primarily eliminated renally, both by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. Dose adjustments are needed in renal impairment.
- **Mode of Action:** Both drugs inhibit the activity of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase enzyme by competing with natural substrates for binding, preventing the synthesis of viral DNA.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Competitive inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase enzyme.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  One tablet (200 mg emtricitabine/300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) once daily, with or without food for HIV treatment; with food for PrEP.

#### **Children:** For HIV treatment, one appropriately dosed tablet (e.g., 167 mg/250 mg, 133 mg/200 mg, or 100 mg/150 mg) based on weight, once daily in children weighing at least 17 kg. Not recommended for PrEP in children weighing less than 35 kg.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Monitor renal function. Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustment is required based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No adjustment necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Assess other medications for potential drug interactions and adjust accordingly.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  Not indicated for use in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergencies such as status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.


### **Dosage Adjustments:** Reduce the frequency of administration according to creatinine clearance in patients with renal impairment. Not recommended for use in patients with severe renal dysfunction.
