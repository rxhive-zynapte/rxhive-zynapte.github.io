      How does Enalapril + Hydrochlorothiazide work to lower blood pressure?**

      **A:** Enalapril blocks the formation of angiotensin II, a potent
      vasoconstrictor, leading to vasodilation. Hydrochlorothiazide promotes the
      excretion of sodium and water, reducing blood volume. These actions
      combined help lower blood pressure.

      What monitoring parameters are essential when a patient is prescribed this
      medication?**

      **A:** Regular monitoring of blood pressure, serum creatinine and BUN, and
      serum electrolytes (especially potassium) is essential. If necessary,
      monitor CBC with differential periodically for patients with renal
      impairment and/or collagen vascular diseases.

## **Usage**

- Enalapril + Hydrochlorothiazide is prescribed for the treatment of essential hypertension (high blood pressure) in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by enalapril alone.  It is not suitable for initial therapy.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Combined Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitor (enalapril) and Thiazide Diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide)
- **Mechanism of Action:** Enalapril blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. This leads to vasodilation and reduced sodium retention. Hydrochlorothiazide increases the excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys, further contributing to lowering blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

- The combination is often referred to as enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide or enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide.
- **Brand Names:** Vaseretic, Lexxel(when combined with felodipine), Lotensin HCT (when combined with benazepril), Capozide (when combined with captopril), Monopril HCT (when combined with fosinopril), Prinzide or Zestoretic(when combined with lisinopril), Uniretic(when combined with moexipril), Accuretic(when combined with quinapril)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Enalapril reduces peripheral vascular resistance and blood volume, leading to a decrease in blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide increases urine output, further reducing blood volume.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Both drugs are orally absorbed, enalapril as the maleate salt which is rapidly hydrolyzed to enalaprilat, the active form. Food does not significantly affect absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Enalapril is partially metabolized to enalaprilat. Hydrochlorothiazide is not extensively metabolized.
    - **Elimination:** Enalapril and enalaprilat are primarily excreted by the kidneys. Hydrochlorothiazide is also excreted by the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:**  Enalapril competitively inhibits ACE, preventing the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Hydrochlorothiazide inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition:** Enalapril inhibits ACE. Hydrochlorothiazide inhibits sodium-chloride symporter.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly renal excretion for both drugs.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: Enalapril 5 to 10 mg + Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg once daily.
- Maintenance dose: Up to Enalapril 20 mg + Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg per day, which can be given as a single dose or in two divided doses.
- Dosage should be titrated based on blood pressure response.

#### **Children:**

- Use and dose must be determined by a doctor, but generally this medication is not recommended for use in children.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Initial dose should be lower (e.g., half a tablet daily) with careful titration based on renal function and blood pressure response.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment is required for patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min/1.73m². This medication is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is required in patients with diabetes, heart failure, and other cardiovascular diseases.
