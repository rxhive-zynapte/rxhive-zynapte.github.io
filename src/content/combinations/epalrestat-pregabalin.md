## **Usage**

Epalrestat + Pregabalin is primarily prescribed for the management of **diabetic neuropathy**, a type of nerve damage that occurs as a complication of diabetes. Symptoms include pain, numbness, tingling, burning, and weakness, usually affecting the hands and feet.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This combination includes drugs from different classifications:

* **Epalrestat:** Aldose reductase inhibitor
* **Pregabalin:** Anticonvulsant, GABA analog

**Mechanism of Action:**  Epalrestat inhibits aldose reductase, thus reducing sorbitol accumulation in nerve cells and preventing nerve damage. Pregabalin reduces the release of neurotransmitters involved in pain transmission by binding to voltage-gated calcium channels. Methylcobalamin (when included in some formulations) helps in nerve regeneration and maintenance of nerve health.


## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized international non-proprietary names for the combination product. It's often referred to by its components, "Epalrestat and Pregabalin." Popular brand names include Alrista Forte, Epalrica-MP, and Prealdonil.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Epalrestat, by inhibiting aldose reductase, decreases sorbitol levels in nerve cells, which alleviates nerve damage. Pregabalin, by binding to the alpha-2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, reduces the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate and substance P, which are involved in pain signaling. Methylcobalamin supports nerve health, function, and myelin production.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Epalrestat:** Primarily metabolized in the liver through glucuronidation and excreted through urine.
* **Pregabalin:** Minimally metabolized in the liver and excreted mainly unchanged through urine.

**Mode of Action:** Epalrestat acts by inhibiting the enzyme aldose reductase, which reduces sorbitol levels in nerve cells, thus reducing nerve damage. Pregabalin binds to the alpha-2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system, reducing the release of pain-signaling neurotransmitters.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Epalrestat inhibits the aldose reductase enzyme. Pregabalin modulates the release of neurotransmitters by binding to the alpha-2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels.

**Elimination Pathways:** Both drugs are primarily eliminated renally.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard dose is usually Epalrestat 50 mg/100 mg + Pregabalin 75 mg/150 mg twice daily or as prescribed by the physician. Dosages may be adjusted based on patient response and tolerability.

#### **Children:**

The safety and efficacy in children and adolescents under 18 years old have not been established, and its use is not recommended for this age group.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and adjust gradually based on renal function and response. Close monitoring is essential.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment is necessary based on creatinine clearance. The combination is contraindicated in patients with end-stage renal disease who are not on dialysis.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advised. Close monitoring of liver function is required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized dosing and monitoring are essential.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources do not detail dosage recommendations for specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or emergency situations.  Dosages in these scenarios should be determined by the attending physician based on individual patient needs.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are required based on individual patient factors, including renal/hepatic dysfunction, other metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism. It is essential to start with a lower dose in elderly patients and patients with renal/hepatic impairment and titrate slowly as needed.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Weight gain, somnolence (sleepiness/drowsiness), dry mouth, blurred vision, urine discoloration, thinking abnormalities (difficulty concentrating), dizziness, headache, edema (swelling in hands and feet).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions, difficulty breathing,  uncoordinated body movements, euphoria, peripheral edema, liver function abnormalities, muscle cramps/spasms, numbness/tingling.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential long-term effects are not explicitly outlined in the provided sources.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs include severe allergic reactions (angioedema), suicidal ideation, and worsening of pre-existing heart conditions.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to Epalrestat, Pregabalin, or any component of the formulation.
