## **Usage**

This combination was previously used to treat asthma and bronchospasm. It combines a bronchodilator (theophylline), a decongestant (ephedrine), and an antihistamine (hydroxyzine).  However, due to the potential for increased side effects and the availability of more effective and safer alternatives, this specific fixed-dose combination is no longer commonly prescribed.  Specifically, the FDA has withdrawn approval for fixed-dose combinations containing ephedrine and theophylline.  Theophylline and hydroxyzine can still be prescribed individually, but the fixed combination is no longer available.

## **Alternate Names**

* Marax (brand name, no longer available)


## **How It Works**

**Ephedrine:** Acts as a sympathomimetic amine, stimulating alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors leading to bronchodilation and vasoconstriction. It also indirectly increases norepinephrine release. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted renally.

**Hydroxyzine:**  An antihistamine that works by blocking the effects of histamine at H1 receptors. This can help relieve itching and reduce allergic reactions. It also has some sedative and anticholinergic properties.  It is metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, and its major metabolite is cetirizine.

**Theophylline:** A methylxanthine that acts as a bronchodilator by relaxing the smooth muscles of the airways. Its mechanism of action involves nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibition, adenosine receptor antagonism, and potentially other pathways. It is metabolized in the liver by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. Elimination is primarily through renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

The fixed-dose combination of ephedrine, hydroxyzine, and theophylline is no longer available and therefore no dosage guidelines can be given. Individualized dosing for theophylline and hydroxyzine can be determined based on patient-specific factors and clinical guidelines for each drug.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Insomnia
* Nervousness
* Gastrointestinal complaints (nausea, vomiting)
* Tachycardia
* Palpitations
* Tremors
* Dizziness
* Headache

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Seizures
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* QT prolongation

### **Long-Term Effects**

The long-term effects of this combination have not been extensively studied due to its discontinuation. However, chronic use of theophylline can lead to tolerance and dependence.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication
* Severe cardiovascular disease
* Hyperthyroidism
* Seizure disorders
* Angle-closure glaucoma
* Urinary retention
* Concurrent use of MAO inhibitors


## **Drug Interactions**

Numerous drug interactions are possible with this combination.  Some clinically significant interactions include:

* **Adrenergic agonists:** May potentiate cardiovascular effects.
* **Beta-blockers:** May antagonize the bronchodilating effects of ephedrine.
* **MAO inhibitors:** May cause severe hypertension.
* **CYP450 interacting drugs:**  Many drugs can affect the metabolism of theophylline and hydroxyzine.
* **Other CNS depressants:** May increase sedation.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

This combination should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential risks to the fetus/infant.
