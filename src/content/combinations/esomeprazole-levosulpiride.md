description: >-
  Esomeprazole + Levosulpiride is prescribed for the treatment of
  gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), particularly in patients who haven't
  responded well to a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) alone.  It is also used to
  treat other acid-related disorders like peptic ulcers and dyspepsia.

      What is the recommended dosage for Esomeprazole + Levosulpiride?**


      **A:** The standard adult dose is 40mg Esomeprazole and 75mg
      Levosulpiride, taken as a single capsule once daily before a meal.  It is
      not recommended for children under 18.

  - q: >-
      How does this combination work differently than Esomeprazole alone?**


      **A:**  Esomeprazole reduces acid production, while Levosulpiride improves
      gastric motility and emptying. Combining them can be more effective for
      GERD than just reducing acid.

## **Usage**

Esomeprazole + Levosulpiride is prescribed for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), particularly in patients who haven't responded well to a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) alone.  It is also used to treat other acid-related disorders like peptic ulcers and dyspepsia.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Esomeprazole: Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI)
* Levosulpiride: Prokinetic agent, Dopamine D2 receptor antagonist

**Mechanism of Action:**

This combination drug works through two distinct mechanisms:
1. Esomeprazole inhibits the H+/K+ ATPase pump in gastric parietal cells, thus reducing gastric acid secretion.
2. Levosulpiride increases acetylcholine release and improves gastrointestinal motility, aiding in faster gastric emptying.  


## **Alternate Names**

While there isn't a universally recognized alternate name, the drug may be referred to by the generic names of its components.  Some possible ways to refer to this combination include:
* Esomeprazole/Levosulpiride
* Levosulpiride/Esomeprazole
* Esomeprazole magnesium + Levosulpiride

**Brand Names:** Some popular brand names include Esomac L, Esomeprazole and Levosulpiride Tablets and others.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* Esomeprazole: Suppresses gastric acid secretion by irreversibly binding to the proton pump.
* Levosulpiride:  Enhances gastric motility and improves the pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* Esomeprazole: Absorbed in the small intestine, metabolized by the liver (CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 enzymes), and excreted primarily through the kidneys.
* Levosulpiride: Absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, minimal hepatic metabolism, eliminated primarily by the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:**

* Esomeprazole: Inhibits the final step of gastric acid production by blocking the H+/K+ ATPase pump, which exchanges potassium for hydrogen ions across parietal cell membranes.
* Levosulpiride: Acts as a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist in the gastrointestinal tract, enhancing acetylcholine release, thus increasing peristalsis and improving gastric emptying.
Elimination: Via renal/hepatic excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The usual dose is one capsule (40mg Esomeprazole + 75mg Levosulpiride) once daily, taken orally on an empty stomach, preferably an hour before meals. Treatment duration is typically 4-8 weeks but depends on the specific condition.

#### **Children:**  

This combination is generally not recommended for use in children below 18 years as its safety and efficacy have not been established in this population.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Exercise caution. Dose adjustments may be needed in patients with renal impairment. Elderly patients are more susceptible to side effects like postural hypotension, sedation, and extrapyramidal symptoms.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in mild to moderate renal impairment; dose reduction might be necessary. Contraindicated in severe renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Avoid in patients with hepatic impairment as a precautionary measure.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Specific adjustments may be required for patients with certain comorbidities like diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Consult a physician for personalized guidance.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of Esomeprazole + Levosulpiride is primarily focused on GERD management.  Its use in the specific clinical settings you mentioned (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, emergency situations) is not specifically indicated.  Other medications are preferred for gastric acid suppression in these situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary based on patient-specific factors like renal/hepatic dysfunction. 


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, dry mouth, dizziness, rash, pruritus, somnolence, breast pain/tenderness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe allergic reactions, extrapyramidal symptoms (movement disorders), cardiac arrhythmias, and hypomagnesemia (low magnesium).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term PPI use might be associated with an increased risk of bone fractures, *Clostridium difficile* infection, vitamin B12 deficiency, and fundic gland polyps.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** 

Any severe or unusual side effects, like angioedema or Stevens-Johnson syndrome, should be reported immediately.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to Esomeprazole, Levosulpiride, or substituted benzimidazoles.
* Concurrent use of rilpivirine.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding, mechanical obstruction, or perforation.
* Severe renal or hepatic impairment.
* Phaeochromocytoma, pituitary prolactinoma, breast cancer.
* Epilepsy, mania.
* Concurrent use of levodopa or other antiparkinson drugs.
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding
