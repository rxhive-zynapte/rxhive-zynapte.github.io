## **Usage**

Esomeprazole + Naproxen is prescribed for the relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis in adults and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in children 12 years and older.  It is specifically indicated for patients at risk of developing NSAID-associated gastric ulcers.

It is a combination drug belonging to the following pharmacological classifications:

* **Naproxen:** Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) - analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic.
* **Esomeprazole:** Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) - antacid.

The mechanism of action involves Naproxen's inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, thereby diminishing inflammation and pain. Esomeprazole suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the H+/K+-ATPase in gastric parietal cells, thus protecting the gastric mucosa from NSAID-induced damage.


## **Alternate Names**

* **Generic Name:** Esomeprazole/Naproxen
* **Brand Name:** Vimovo

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Naproxen exerts its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, reducing prostaglandin production. Esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, irreversibly binds to H+/K+-ATPase, blocking the final step in gastric acid secretion, thus reducing intragastric acidity.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Naproxen and esomeprazole are both absorbed orally. Naproxen's absorption is delayed when taken with food. Esomeprazole is formulated as an enteric-coated component in Vimovo to protect it from degradation in the stomach acid and to delay its release. The enteric coating dissolves at higher intestinal pH, triggering the release of esomeprazole in the intestine. This is necessary to ensure appropriate absorption of esomeprazole and to minimize acid-related side effects.
* **Metabolism:** Naproxen is extensively metabolized in the liver primarily via CYP450 enzymes (CYP1A2 and CYP2C9). Esomeprazole is also metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4.
* **Elimination:** Naproxen is primarily excreted in the urine, with a small amount eliminated in the feces. Esomeprazole is also mainly excreted in the urine, as metabolites.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** One tablet (375 mg naproxen/20 mg esomeprazole or 500 mg naproxen/20 mg esomeprazole) twice daily, taken orally at least 30 minutes before a meal.

#### **Children:**

* **12 years and older and weighing 38 kg to less than 50 kg:** One tablet (375 mg naproxen/20 mg esomeprazole) twice daily.
* **12 years and older and weighing 50 kg or more:** One tablet (375 mg naproxen/20 mg esomeprazole or 500 mg naproxen/20 mg esomeprazole) twice daily.
* **Younger than 12 years:** Use and dose must be determined by a doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Elderly patients are more susceptible to adverse events associated with NSAIDs. Close monitoring is recommended, and dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min). Dose adjustment may be necessary in mild to moderate renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Dose adjustment of the naproxen component may be considered in mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is recommended in patients with conditions such as hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, asthma, or a history of gastrointestinal bleeding.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of esomeprazole and naproxen is not specifically indicated for use in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its primary use is for chronic management of inflammatory arthritis.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments should be made based on patient-specific factors like renal function, hepatic function, and other comorbid conditions as described above. Individualized therapy is crucial for optimizing efficacy and minimizing risks.

## **Drug Interactions**

Esomeprazole + Naproxen interacts with numerous medications, including:

* **CYP450 substrates:**  May alter the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4.
* **Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin):**  May increase the risk of bleeding.
* **Antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel):** Increased risk of bleeding.
* **Methotrexate:** May enhance methotrexate toxicity.
* **Tacrolimus:**  May increase tacrolimus levels.
* **Antihypertensives:** May reduce the effectiveness of antihypertensive medications.
* **Diuretics:** May lead to impaired response to diuretic therapy.
* **Lithium:**  May increase lithium levels.
* **Rilpivirine:**  Contraindicated due to potential for interaction.

Additionally, alcohol, smoking, and certain foods (e.g., grapefruit juice) may also interact with this medication. Consult a detailed drug interaction resource for comprehensive information.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Use is not recommended after 20 weeks of gestation due to the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Use between 20 and 30 weeks should only be considered if the potential benefit outweighs the risk. Use is contraindicated after 30 weeks of gestation.
* **Breastfeeding:** Naproxen is excreted in breast milk. It is unknown if esomeprazole is excreted in breast milk.  Use during breastfeeding is not recommended.
