While the prompt mentions Estradiol in combination with the listed Testosterone esters, available information pertains to a combination of Testosterone esters (Sustanon) without Estradiol. This response will focus on the Testosterone combination product.  If a combined product with Estradiol exists, further information is required to accurately describe its properties.

## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** This combination of testosterone esters (commonly known as Sustanon) is prescribed for Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) in males with hypogonadism, where testosterone deficiency is confirmed by clinical features and biochemical tests. It is also used as supportive therapy for female-to-male transsexuals.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Androgen, Anabolic Steroid, Hormone Replacement Therapy.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Sustanon delivers testosterone via its ester components. These esters are metabolized to release free testosterone, which then exerts its effects by binding to androgen receptors in various tissues. This leads to the development and maintenance of male secondary sexual characteristics,  increased protein synthesis, and enhanced libido and sexual function.

## **Alternate Names**

- Sustanon 250 (common name representing the concentration of 250 mg/mL)
- Other brand names may vary regionally.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Testosterone, the active component, binds to intracellular androgen receptors. This complex then translocates to the nucleus, affecting gene expression and influencing protein synthesis. This results in anabolic effects (muscle growth, bone density), masculinization (hair growth, voice deepening), and erythropoiesis.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  The different esters in Sustanon are absorbed at varying rates after intramuscular injection, leading to a prolonged release of testosterone.
    - **Absorption:** The esters are hydrolyzed to release testosterone.
    - **Metabolism:** Testosterone is primarily metabolized in the liver.  A portion converts to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and estradiol.
    - **Elimination:** Testosterone and its metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine, with a small portion in feces.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (including elderly):**

- The usual dose is 1 mL (250 mg) intramuscularly every 3 weeks. Dosage should be individualized based on the patient's response and testosterone levels.

#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy have not been established in children. Use with caution in pre-pubertal children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- Dose adjustment may be needed in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  Careful monitoring of testosterone levels is important.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The listed clinical use cases (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations) are not relevant for Sustanon. Sustanon is used for long-term hormone replacement, not for acute medical situations.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Injection site pain, acne, increased red blood cell count (polycythemia), gynecomastia (breast enlargement), prostate enlargement, fluid retention.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Venous thromboembolism, sleep apnea, liver dysfunction, cardiovascular events.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

-  Prostate cancer risk, infertility.


## **Contraindications**

- Known or suspected prostate or breast cancer.
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding.
- Hypersensitivity to testosterone or any components of the formulation (including arachis oil - peanut allergy).

## **Drug Interactions**

- Anticoagulants (may potentiate their effects).
- Corticosteroids (increased risk of fluid retention).
- Diabetes medications (may alter glucose control).



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential virilization of the fetus/infant.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Testosterone replacement.
- **Side Effects:** Injection site pain, acne, gynecomastia, polycythemia, prostate enlargement.
- **Contraindications:** Prostate/breast cancer, pregnancy, breastfeeding.
- **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, corticosteroids, diabetes medications.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
- **Dosage:** 1 mL IM every 3 weeks.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Testosterone levels, PSA, hematocrit.

## **Popular Combinations**

Sustanon is not typically combined with other drugs for its primary indication of hypogonadism. In transgender hormone therapy, it may be used in conjunction with estrogen preparations.

## **Precautions**

- Monitor for signs of prostate cancer, polycythemia, sleep apnea.
- Caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, liver or kidney disease.
