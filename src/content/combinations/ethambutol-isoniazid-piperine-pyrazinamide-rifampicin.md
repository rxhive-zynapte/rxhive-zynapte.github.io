## **Usage**

- This fixed-dose combination (FDC) medication is primarily prescribed for the treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), specifically during the intensive phase of treatment.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Anti-tuberculosis agents, combination drug.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination targets *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* through multiple pathways, exerting a bactericidal effect.  Rifampicin inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase. Isoniazid disrupts mycolic acid synthesis. Pyrazinamide disrupts mycobacterial cell membrane metabolism. Ethambutol inhibits arabinosyl transferases, enzymes involved in cell wall synthesis. Piperine enhances bioavailability of the other drugs, especially rifampicin.


## **Alternate Names**
- Rifampicin + Isoniazid + Pyrazinamide + Ethambutol + Piperine
- Anti-tuberculosis combination therapy (containing Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol, and Piperine)
- RIPE + Piperine

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The combination exerts a bactericidal effect against *M. tuberculosis* by targeting different aspects of bacterial metabolism and cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial death.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Orally administered; absorption of rifampicin is affected by food. Best taken on an empty stomach.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily hepatic metabolism for rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide. Ethambutol is partially metabolized.
    - **Elimination:** Renal excretion is the major route for all components, except for rifampicin, which is primarily biliary excreted.
- **Mode of Action:** See "Mechanism of Action" under "Usage."


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Dosage is based on body weight, aligned with WHO guidelines:
    - 30-37 kg: 2 tablets/day as a single dose
    - 38-54 kg: 3 tablets/day as a single dose
    - 55-70 kg: 4 tablets/day as a single dose
    - ≥ 71 kg: 5 tablets/day as a single dose

Intensive phase typically lasts two months, followed by a continuation phase with a different drug regimen.

#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy not established in children under 13 years old (or weighing less than 20 kg). Alternative formulations and dosing strategies are required for pediatric patients. Refer to WHO guidelines for pediatric dosing of individual components.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Administer with caution; closely monitor liver and renal function. Dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Individual components require dose adjustments based on creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Close monitoring of liver function is essential. Dosage adjustments may be necessary for isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide due to hepatic metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful evaluation and potential dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with diabetes, HIV, or other conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of this specific FDC is limited to the treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary TB. The listed scenarios (intubation, surgical procedures, etc.) are not relevant to the use of this FDC.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose modifications are necessary based on patient-specific factors, including renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism. Consider therapeutic drug monitoring for optimization.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
- Nausea, vomiting
- Loss of appetite
- Abdominal discomfort
- Mild skin rash, itching
- Headache, dizziness
- Flu-like symptoms
- Reddish-orange discoloration of body fluids (urine, sweat, tears) – harmless effect of rifampicin

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Hepatotoxicity (liver damage) – evidenced by jaundice, dark urine, pale stools
- Optic neuritis (ethambutol) – changes in vision, blurred vision, eye pain
- Peripheral neuropathy (isoniazid) – numbness, tingling, burning in hands and feet
- Thrombocytopenia, purpura, hemolytic anemia (rifampicin)
- Severe hypersensitivity reactions – fever, chills, joint pain, skin rash, difficulty breathing

### **Long-Term Effects**
- Chronic liver disease (with prolonged use of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide)
- Persistent peripheral neuropathy


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

ADRs are essentially the same as the rare but serious side effects. Any sign of hepatotoxicity, optic neuritis, peripheral neuropathy, or severe hypersensitivity requires immediate discontinuation of the drug and prompt medical intervention.


## **Contraindications**
- Hypersensitivity to any of the components (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, piperine)
- Severe liver disease (acute or chronic)
- Acute gout
- Concurrent use with voriconazole or HIV protease inhibitors
- Optic neuritis (ethambutol contraindicated unless benefits outweigh risks)
- Porphyria (use rifampicin with caution)



## **Drug Interactions**
- **Rifampicin:** Induces CYP450 enzymes, decreasing the effectiveness of many drugs, including warfarin, oral contraceptives, some anticonvulsants, antifungals, corticosteroids, and HIV medications.
- **Isoniazid:** Inhibits metabolism of certain drugs, such as phenytoin. Can enhance the effects of alcohol.
- **Pyrazinamide:** Can increase serum uric acid levels, interacting with medications for gout.
- **Ethambutol:** Avoid concomitant use of other drugs that can cause optic neuritis.
- **Food Interactions:** Avoid alcohol while on this medication. Consult a dietitian for dietary recommendations.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  While individual components have generally shown a good safety record, caution is advised during pregnancy. Use only if benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  Pyridoxine supplementation is recommended with isoniazid.
- **Breastfeeding:** All components are excreted in breast milk to varying degrees. Monitor infants for potential side effects.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
- **Mechanism of Action:** Targets *M. tuberculosis* through multiple pathways inhibiting RNA synthesis, mycolic acid synthesis, cell wall synthesis, and disrupting cell membrane function. Piperine enhances bioavailability.
- **Side Effects:** Common: Nausea, vomiting, rash, headache. Serious:  Hepatotoxicity, optic neuritis, peripheral neuropathy.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe liver disease, acute gout, concomitant use with certain drugs, optic neuritis.
- **Drug Interactions:** Rifampicin induces CYP450; isoniazid inhibits metabolism of some drugs; interactions with anticoagulants, anticonvulsants, antifungals.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution; monitor infants.
