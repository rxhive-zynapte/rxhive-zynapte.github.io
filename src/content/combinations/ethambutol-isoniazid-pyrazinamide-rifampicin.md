## **Usage**

- This combination drug is prescribed for the treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. It is used for the initial, intensive phase of treatment.
- **Pharmacological classification**:  Anti-tuberculosis agents,  combination antibiotic.
- **Mechanism of Action**: This four-drug combination acts synergistically to target different aspects of *M. tuberculosis* metabolism and reproduction.  Isoniazid inhibits cell wall synthesis, rifampicin inhibits RNA polymerase, pyrazinamide disrupts bacterial metabolic processes, and ethambutol inhibits cell wall biosynthesis.

## **Alternate Names**

- This combination is often referred to as RIPE (Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol), 4-drug FDC, or 4FDC.
- Brand names: Rifater, Voractiv, Myrin-P Forte, Akit-4.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**:  The combined bactericidal action of the four drugs rapidly reduces the bacterial load, leading to clinical improvement.
- **Pharmacokinetics**:
    - **Absorption**: All four drugs are absorbed orally, though rifampicin absorption is best on an empty stomach. Food can reduce bioavailability.
    - **Metabolism**: Rifampicin is a potent inducer of CYP450 enzymes, especially CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Isoniazid inhibits CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Pyrazinamide is metabolized in the liver. Ethambutol is partially metabolized and largely excreted unchanged.
    - **Elimination**: Rifampicin is primarily excreted in bile and feces; isoniazid is renally excreted; pyrazinamide is renally excreted; and ethambutol is excreted primarily in urine and partially in feces.
- **Mode of Action**:
    - Isoniazid inhibits mycolic acid synthesis, a crucial component of the mycobacterial cell wall.
    - Rifampicin inhibits bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, preventing RNA synthesis.
    - Pyrazinamide disrupts mycobacterial membrane potential and energy production.
    - Ethambutol inhibits arabinosyl transferases, disrupting cell wall synthesis.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults**:

- **Weight-based dosing is recommended:**
    - **30-35 kg**: 150 mg Rifampicin/75 mg Isoniazid/400 mg Pyrazinamide/275 mg Ethambutol (2 tablets Rifater, if using a combination product)
    - **36-45 kg**: 200 mg Isoniazid, 300 mg Rifampicin, 800 mg Pyrazinamide, 600 mg Ethambutol. This can sometimes be simplified as 3 tablets Rifater, if using a combination product.
    - **46-55 kg**: 300 mg Isoniazid, 450 mg Rifampicin, 1000-1200 mg Pyrazinamide, 800-1000 mg Ethambutol. This can sometimes be simplified as 4 tablets Rifater, if using a combination product.
    - **56-70 kg**: 300 mg Isoniazid, 450-600 mg Rifampicin, 1200-1600 mg Pyrazinamide, 1000-1200 mg Ethambutol. This can sometimes be simplified as 5 tablets Rifater, if using a combination product.
    - **&gt;70 kg**: 300 mg Isoniazid, 600 mg Rifampicin, 1600-2000 mg Pyrazinamide, 1200 mg Ethambutol. This can sometimes be simplified as 6 tablets Rifater, if using a combination product.
- Administered orally once daily.


#### **Children**:

- **Weight-based dosing is essential**: Refer to WHO guidelines for detailed weight-band specific dosing using dispersible or liquid formulations. Fixed-dose combination tablets are not suitable for children weighing less than 25 kg as dose adjustments are difficult with these. 
- **Pediatric Safety Considerations**: Monitor closely for adverse reactions, especially hepatotoxicity.



#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: Assess renal and hepatic function for potential dose adjustments.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**:  Dose reduction of all components might be necessary, depending on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Use with caution and monitor closely for hepatotoxicity. Dose reduction may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Consider drug interactions and potential exacerbations of pre-existing conditions.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

- The primary use case is the initial phase of drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis treatment.  These specific settings (intubation, surgical procedures, etc.) are not relevant for the drug's clinical use in TB treatment.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments are based on renal/hepatic function, drug interactions, and adverse reactions. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) can be helpful in optimizing drug levels.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**:
- Nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort
- Loss of appetite, fatigue
- Mild rash, itching
- Arthralgias, myalgias
- Peripheral neuropathy (especially with isoniazid â€“ administer pyridoxine 10 mg/day prophylactically)
- Discoloration of body fluids (reddish-orange) due to rifampicin.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**:
- Hepatotoxicity (monitor liver function tests)
- Optic neuritis (ethambutol - perform regular eye exams)
- Thrombocytopenia, purpura, haemolytic anaemia
- Acute kidney injury
- Seizures (isoniazid)
- Gout (pyrazinamide - monitor uric acid levels)


### **Long-Term Effects**:
- Peripheral neuropathy can persist after discontinuation of isoniazid.
- Visual impairment from ethambutol can be permanent if not detected and treated promptly.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**:
- Severe hypersensitivity reactions (rash, fever, eosinophilia, angioedema)
- Drug-induced hepatitis
- Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)



## **Contraindications**

- Acute liver disease
- Severe renal impairment
- Previous hypersensitivity reaction to any component drug
- Porphyria (use with caution)
- Concurrent use with voriconazole or certain protease inhibitors


## **Drug Interactions**

- Rifampicin is a potent inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 and interacts with numerous drugs.
- Isoniazid inhibits CYP2C19 and CYP3A4.
- Avoid concomitant use with phenytoin, valproic acid, disulfiram.
- Interactions occur with:  anticoagulants, anticonvulsants, antifungals, oral contraceptives, some HIV medications, immunosuppressants.
- Alcohol should be avoided due to increased risk of hepatotoxicity and dizziness.
