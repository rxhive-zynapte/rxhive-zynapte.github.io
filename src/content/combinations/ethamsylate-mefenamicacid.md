## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) and associated pain (dysmenorrhea).  Ethamsylate is a haemostatic agent, and mefenamic acid is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).

- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Ethamsylate is a haemostatic, antihemorrhagic agent. Mefenamic acid is an NSAID (analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic).

- **Mechanism of Action:** Ethamsylate works by enhancing platelet adhesion and improving capillary resistance, thereby promoting clot formation and reducing bleeding. Mefenamic acid inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, which reduces pain and inflammation.


## **Alternate Names**

There is no internationally recognized non-proprietary name for this combination. It's often referred to by the names of its components. Several brand names exist, including Osemic-MF and Tenxima MF.  Regional variations may also exist.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ethamsylate promotes hemostasis by enhancing platelet aggregation and adhesion, leading to reduced bleeding time. Mefenamic acid reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, decreasing prostaglandin production.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Ethamsylate is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 4 hours. It is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Mefenamic acid is also well-absorbed orally, with peak plasma levels achieved in 2-4 hours. It undergoes hepatic metabolism and is excreted primarily in the urine and bile.

- **Mode of Action:** Ethamsylate works by increasing interaction between endothelial cells and platelets.  Mefenamic acid inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, leading to reduced prostaglandin synthesis.

- **Elimination Pathways:**  Ethamsylate primarily through renal excretion. Mefenamic acid through hepatic metabolism and renal and biliary excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The typical dose is one tablet (containing 250mg mefenamic acid and 500 mg of tranexamic acid or 500 mg of etamsylate) two to three times a day, starting on the first day of menstruation or as prescribed by the physician. It's often recommended to take the medication with food to reduce gastrointestinal side effects.

#### **Children:**

Use in children under 14 is generally not recommended, as safety and efficacy haven't been established in this age group.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment may be necessary, starting with the lower end of the dosing range.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised, and dose reduction may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution, as dose adjustments might be required.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with a history of thromboembolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, or gastrointestinal problems.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of ethamsylate and mefenamic acid isn't typically used in the following clinical settings: intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, and emergency situations. In such cases, intravenous tranexamic acid might be utilized alone or in combination with other agents, depending on the clinical context. Ethamsylate may be used in surgery to minimize capillary bleeding.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are based on patient response, renal or hepatic dysfunction, and other medical conditions. Individualized dosing is crucial, emphasizing close patient monitoring.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, indigestion, heartburn, dizziness.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), thromboembolic events (chest pain, shortness of breath), gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration, visual disturbances, severe skin reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis).


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term continuous use isn't typically recommended. Prolonged use of mefenamic acid carries the risk of gastrointestinal issues, renal dysfunction, and cardiovascular complications.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, thromboembolic complications, gastrointestinal bleeding, and severe skin reactions.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to either component, active intravascular clotting, subarachnoid hemorrhage, history of thromboembolic events, severe renal impairment, severe hepatic impairment, porphyria.


## **Drug Interactions**

Anticoagulants (warfarin, heparin), other NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen), antihypertensives, hormonal contraceptives, estrogens, retinoids, some antibiotics, alcohol.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

This combination should be avoided during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, due to the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in the fetus. Mefenamic acid can be excreted in breast milk, and its use during breastfeeding isn't generally recommended.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Ethamsylate enhances platelet function and capillary resistance; mefenamic acid inhibits prostaglandin synthesis.

- **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, gastrointestinal issues, thromboembolic events.

- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, active clotting disorders, thromboembolic history, pregnancy.

- **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, NSAIDs, hormonal contraceptives.

- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid during pregnancy, especially the third trimester; use with caution during breastfeeding.

- **Dosage:** 1 tablet (250 mg mefenamic acid, 500 mg tranexamic acid or 500 mg etamsylate) 2-3 times/day during menstruation.

- **Monitoring Parameters:** Menstrual blood loss, pain scores, liver and kidney function, signs of thromboembolic complications.


## **Popular Combinations**

This specific combination is commonly prescribed, and adding other drugs isn't usually required.


## **Precautions**

Assess renal and hepatic function, history of thromboembolic events, gastrointestinal issues, and allergies before prescribing. Monitor for signs of clotting disorders and adverse reactions. Caution during breastfeeding and avoid in pregnancy, especially the third trimester.  Avoid alcohol to minimize potential adverse effects.
