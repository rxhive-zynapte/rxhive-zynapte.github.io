## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** This combination drug is primarily prescribed for contraception (preventing pregnancy). It's also used to treat menstrual disorders such as dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation), premenstrual syndrome (PMS), menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding), and irregular menstrual cycles.  It can also improve iron deficiency anemia associated with menstruation.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing a hormonal contraceptive (estrogen and progestin) and an iron supplement.  Specifically, it's classified as a combined oral contraceptive (COC) and a hematinic.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Primarily prevents pregnancy by inhibiting ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary).  It also thickens cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to enter the uterus and reach the egg, and alters the uterine lining, making implantation of a fertilized egg less likely. The ferrous fumarate component replenishes iron lost during menstruation.

## **Alternate Names**

- While the generic name is Ethinyl Estradiol + Ferrous Fumarate + Levonorgestrel, specific formulations may have various names depending on the manufacturer and region.
- **Brand Names:** Trust Pill,  Ashlyna (for Levonorgestrel + Ethinylestradiol component only), several more exist and vary by region.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, leading to decreased secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).  This prevents follicular development and ovulation.  The progestin component also thickens cervical mucus and induces endometrial atrophy. Ferrous fumarate provides supplemental iron, which is incorporated into hemoglobin.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Levonorgestrel has nearly 100% bioavailability, while ethinyl estradiol's bioavailability is lower (around 40-45%) due to first-pass metabolism. Ferrous fumarate absorption can be affected by various dietary factors.
    - **Metabolism:** Levonorgestrel is metabolized in the liver to sulfate and glucuronide conjugates. Ethinyl estradiol is metabolized by hepatic CYP3A4.
    - **Elimination:** Metabolites of both hormones are primarily excreted in urine and feces. Iron is eliminated through shedding of intestinal mucosal cells, bile, and urine.
- **Mode of Action:**  Ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel bind to estrogen and progesterone receptors, respectively, modulating gene expression and downstream effects.  These hormonal actions suppress the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), ultimately inhibiting ovulation.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** These hormones exert their effects through interactions with steroid hormone receptors.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism and renal/biliary excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- One tablet daily, starting on the first day of menstruation or any day during the first five days. If starting later in the cycle, backup contraception is advised for the initial 7 days.
