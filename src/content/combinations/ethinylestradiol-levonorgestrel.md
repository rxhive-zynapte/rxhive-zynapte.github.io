## **Usage**

- Ethinyl Estradiol + Levonorgestrel is prescribed for **oral contraception (prevention of pregnancy)**. Some formulations are also indicated for the treatment of **abnormal uterine bleeding**, particularly functional uterine bleeding unrelated to pregnancy.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Combined hormonal contraceptive (estrogen-progestogen).
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination primarily prevents pregnancy by inhibiting ovulation. The estrogen component suppresses the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland, thus preventing the development and release of a mature egg. The progestin component thickens cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to enter the uterus, and alters the uterine lining, making it less receptive to implantation.

## **Alternate Names**

-  Combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP), birth control pill, the pill.
- **Brand Names:** Alesse, Altavera, Amethyst, Aviane, Balcoltra, Camrese Lo, Chateal, Daysee, Dolishale, Falessa, Falmina, Jaimiess, Jolessa, Kurvelo, Lessina, Levlen, LoSeasonique, Lutera, Marlissa, Portia, Preven (discontinued in the US), Seasonale, Seasonique, Setlakin, Simpesse, Sronyx, Trivora, Tyblume, Vienva.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ethinyl estradiol, a synthetic estrogen, and levonorgestrel, a synthetic progestogen, work synergistically to achieve contraception. Estrogen primarily suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, inhibiting ovulation. Progestogen thickens cervical mucus, hinders sperm transport, and induces endometrial changes unfavorable for implantation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Both drugs are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Levonorgestrel has near 100% bioavailability, whereas ethinyl estradiol's bioavailability is lower (38-48%) due to first-pass metabolism.
    - **Metabolism:** Both are extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4 enzymes.
    - **Elimination:** Metabolites are excreted in urine and feces.
- **Mode of Action:** Ethinyl estradiol binds to estrogen receptors, while levonorgestrel binds to progesterone receptors. These actions lead to the described pharmacodynamic effects.  
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** The primary mechanism involves receptor binding (estrogen and progesterone receptors).

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** One tablet daily, containing a specific combination of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel (e.g., 0.03 mg/0.15 mg), taken at the same time each day. Most formulations involve 21 days of active pills followed by 7 days of inactive pills (or fewer/none in extended-cycle regimens). Some regimens have varying doses throughout the 21-day cycle.

#### **Children:** Use and dose must be determined by a doctor. Not recommended before menarche.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Generally not indicated for postmenopausal women.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution; dose adjustment may be required. Contraindicated in severe liver disease.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, history of thromboembolism, migraines, or liver disease.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Ethinyl Estradiol + Levonorgestrel's primary indication is contraception. It does not have specific dosage recommendations for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary for patients with hepatic or renal impairment and those taking interacting medications.  Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism may also require dose adjustments.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, headache, breast tenderness, breakthrough bleeding, weight changes, mood changes, acne, fluid retention, changes in libido.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, heart attack), liver problems (jaundice, hepatitis), gallbladder disease, hypertension, increased risk of breast and cervical cancer.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Potential for increased risk of certain cancers with prolonged use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, thromboembolic events, hepatic dysfunction, significant blood pressure elevation.


## **Contraindications**

Pregnancy, history of thromboembolic disorders, breast cancer or other estrogen/progestin-sensitive cancers, liver disease (tumors, hepatitis, cirrhosis), undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding, smoking (especially in women over 35), uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes with vascular complications, migraines with aura.


## **Drug Interactions**

Several drugs can interact with Ethinyl Estradiol + Levonorgestrel, including:

- **Enzyme inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine):** Reduce contraceptive effectiveness.
- **Enzyme inhibitors (e.g., some antifungals, some antibiotics):** May increase hormone levels and risk of side effects.
- **St. John's Wort, certain antivirals, lamotrigine.**
- **Food and lifestyle factors:** Alcohol, grapefruit juice, smoking can potentially affect metabolism.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** X (contraindicated).
- **Fetal risks:** Although inadvertent exposure during early pregnancy has not been linked to birth defects, it's crucial to discontinue use if pregnancy occurs.
- **Breastfeeding:** Small amounts of hormones are excreted in breast milk. May decrease milk production. Alternative contraception is recommended while breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits ovulation, thickens cervical mucus, alters endometrium.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, headache, bleeding irregularities, thromboembolic events (rare).
- **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, thromboembolic history, estrogen/progestogen-sensitive cancers, liver disease.
- **Drug Interactions:** Enzyme inducers/inhibitors, certain antibiotics, St. John's Wort.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy; not recommended during breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** One tablet daily, typically 21 active/7 inactive pill cycle.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, BMI, lipid profile (if at risk), signs of thromboembolism, depression.

## **Popular Combinations**

Ethinyl Estradiol + Levonorgestrel is itself a combination product and is generally not combined with other medications for contraception.  However, folate supplementation is often recommended alongside COCPs.


## **Precautions**

- Pre-screening for cardiovascular risk factors, liver function, and family history of thromboembolic disorders.
- **Pregnant Women:** Contraindicated.
- **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Not recommended.
- **Children & Elderly:** Use with caution in adolescents and generally avoid in older women.
