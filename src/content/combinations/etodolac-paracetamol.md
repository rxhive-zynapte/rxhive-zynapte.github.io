This drug combination has been banned by the Central Government of India, effective August 12, 2024, due to a lack of therapeutic justification and potential health risks. Therefore, the following information is for historical reference only and should not be used for prescribing or administering this medication.

## **Usage** (Historical)
- This fixed-dose combination was previously indicated for pain and inflammation associated with chronic conditions like osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.  
- **Pharmacological classification:** Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) + Analgesic/Antipyretic.
- **Mechanism of action:** Etodolac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin production, thereby decreasing inflammation and pain. Paracetamol's analgesic and antipyretic effects are thought to involve inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis in the central nervous system, although the exact mechanism remains unclear.


## **Alternate Names** (Historical)
-  While no specific alternate names exist for the combination, the individual components have their own variations. Internationally, paracetamol may be referred to as acetaminophen.
- **Brand Names:** This combination was marketed under various brand names, with "Etowise-P" being one example. However, these brands are no longer available due to the ban.


## **How It Works** (Historical)
- **Pharmacodynamics:** Etodolac reduces inflammation, pain, and fever. Paracetamol primarily reduces pain and fever.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Etodolac is well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, and primarily excreted by the kidneys. Paracetamol is also readily absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, and eliminated in the urine.
- **Mode of action:**  Etodolac acts peripherally by inhibiting COX enzymes, thus blocking prostaglandin production. Paracetamol's central action likely involves similar inhibition, although the details are not fully understood. 
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Etodolac primarily inhibits COX enzymes. The exact mechanism of paracetamol is not fully elucidated but is thought to involve central COX inhibition.
- **Elimination pathways:** Both drugs are primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys.


## **Dosage** (Historical)

The following dosage information is provided solely for historical context. This combination is **no longer recommended or available** for use.
