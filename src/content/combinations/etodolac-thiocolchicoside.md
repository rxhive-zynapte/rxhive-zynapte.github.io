      How does Etodolac + Thiocolchicoside work to relieve pain?**


      **A:** Etodolac reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting COX enzymes
      and thus prostaglandin synthesis. Thiocolchicoside relieves muscle spasms
      through a central action, possibly by modulating GABAergic and glycinergic
      neurotransmission.

## **Usage**

- Etodolac + Thiocolchicoside is prescribed for the management of pain and muscle spasm associated with musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and acute pain conditions like sprains, strains, and low back pain.
- **Pharmacological classification:** This combination drug includes a Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) - Etodolac, and a muscle relaxant - Thiocolchicoside.
- **Mechanism of action:** Etodolac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, thereby decreasing pain and inflammation. Thiocolchicoside acts centrally, possibly as a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist and glycine receptor antagonist,  reducing muscle stiffness and spasms.

## **Alternate Names** 

- While no specific international non-proprietary names (INN) exist for this combination, Etodolac and Thiocolchicoside are the established generic names.
- **Brand names:**  Etova MR,  Etova MR Forte, Setolac MR, Arkolac-T4, Etoselect Thio, Fordolac-MR, Etowise-TH.  (Note: Brand names can vary regionally).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Etodolac exerts analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, leading to a decrease in prostaglandin production. Thiocolchicoside reduces muscle tone and spasm through a central mechanism, although the precise mode of action is not fully understood.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Etodolac is well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 isoenzymes, and excreted mainly through the kidneys. Thiocolchicoside is also absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, and excreted in urine and feces.
- **Mode of action:** Etodolac acts by inhibiting the activity of COX enzymes, which are involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins, key mediators of pain and inflammation.  Thiocolchicoside's precise mechanism is uncertain, but it likely involves modulation of GABAergic and glycinergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system, leading to muscle relaxation.
- **Elimination pathways:** Etodolac is mainly eliminated through renal excretion of its metabolites. Thiocolchicoside is excreted both in urine and feces.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- One tablet of Etodolac 400 mg + Thiocolchicoside 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily. (Some sources mention Etodolac 300 mg + Thiocolchicoside 4 mg). Administer orally, preferably with or after meals.
- Maximum dose:  Not clearly defined for the combination but should be guided by individual components.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for children under 16 years old due to safety and efficacy concerns.


#### **Special Cases:**  
- **Elderly Patients**: Exercise caution, initiate therapy at the lower end of the dosing range, and closely monitor renal function.
