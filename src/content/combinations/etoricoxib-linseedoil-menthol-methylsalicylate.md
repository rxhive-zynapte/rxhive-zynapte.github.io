## **Usage**

This topical gel is prescribed for the relief of pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, muscle aches, sprains, and back pain. It is specifically formulated for external use on the affected area.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) combined with topical analgesics and a skin-soothing agent.

**Mechanism of Action:** Etoricoxib inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin production, thus decreasing pain and inflammation. Linseed oil, with its omega-3 fatty acids, has anti-inflammatory effects, enhances etoricoxib penetration, and improves local blood circulation. Menthol and methyl salicylate provide counterirritant and analgesic effects through their cooling and warming actions, distracting from pain and further promoting local circulation.


## **Alternate Names**

This combination gel is marketed under various brand names such as Cetoxib Gel, Etotag Gel, Just Relief Gel, Tocobix Gel, Etorikind Gel, Nucoxia Emulgel, Gexib Gel, Geto Gel, Etolase Gel, Etozror Gel, and Ecoxib Plus Gel.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Etoricoxib primarily reduces inflammation and pain by inhibiting COX-2. Linseed oil enhances penetration and adds anti-inflammatory properties. Menthol and methyl salicylate act as counterirritants, producing cooling and warming sensations that distract from pain.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Primarily topical absorption occurs with minimal systemic effects.  The metabolism and elimination pathways for this topical formulation are not fully characterized.  However, etoricoxib, when administered orally, is metabolized in the liver by CYP enzymes and excreted primarily through the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** Etoricoxib binds to and inhibits COX-2 enzymes, reducing the production of prostaglandins, which are mediators of inflammation and pain.  Menthol and methyl salicylate activate TRPM8 receptors, producing a cooling sensation. Methyl salicylate is also thought to exert a mild anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting COX enzymes.

**Elimination Pathways:**  For the topical gel, minimal systemic absorption limits the relevance of hepatic and renal excretion pathways. For oral etoricoxib, hepatic metabolism via CYP enzymes and subsequent renal excretion are the primary routes of elimination.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer to the affected area 3–4 times daily or as directed by a physician. Gently massage into the skin until absorbed.  Do not apply to broken or irritated skin, or near the eyes, nose, or mouth.

#### **Children:** Use in children under 18 is not recommended without a doctor's advice.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically needed but caution is advised if renal or hepatic impairment is present. Individualized dosing based on patient response and tolerance is recommended.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised, and dosage adjustments may be needed depending on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, and dosage adjustments may be necessary.  
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized assessment is required for patients with comorbidities like diabetes or cardiovascular disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The drug is intended for topical application and is not indicated for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be necessary based on patient-specific factors, including renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Application site reactions (burning, stinging, irritation, itching, redness).


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Not typically associated with long-term adverse effects when used topically as directed. However, prolonged use of high doses may increase the risk of systemic side effects associated with etoricoxib, such as gastrointestinal issues or cardiovascular events.  


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** 

Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis).



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any component of the gel, history of aspirin-induced asthma or urticaria, active peptic ulcer, severe heart failure, severe hepatic impairment, third trimester of pregnancy.



## **Drug Interactions**

Interactions with other topically applied medications are unlikely. Systemic interactions with oral NSAIDs, anticoagulants (warfarin, apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, etc.), and other drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes are possible but less likely due to limited systemic absorption.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use during pregnancy, especially after 20 weeks, is not recommended due to potential risks to the fetus. Consult a doctor before use during breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Etoricoxib: COX-2 inhibitor; Linseed Oil: enhances penetration, anti-inflammatory; Menthol & Methyl Salicylate: counterirritants, topical analgesics.
