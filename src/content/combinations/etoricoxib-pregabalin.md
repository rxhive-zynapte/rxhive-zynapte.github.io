      How does Etoricoxib + Pregabalin work for nerve pain?**


      **A:** Etoricoxib reduces inflammation, while Pregabalin reduces pain
      signals by affecting neurotransmitter release in the nervous system.  This

## **Usage**

Etoricoxib + Pregabalin is prescribed for the management of neuropathic pain, particularly conditions like diabetic peripheral neuropathy, spinal cord injury-related neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, and fibromyalgia.  It is also prescribed for chronic low back pain with both nociceptive and neuropathic components.

It combines drugs from two pharmacological classifications:

*   **Etoricoxib:** Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), specifically a COX-2 inhibitor.
*   **Pregabalin:** Anticonvulsant and analgesic used for neuropathic pain.

The mechanism of action involves etoricoxib's inhibition of COX-2 enzymes, reducing inflammation and pain, while pregabalin binds to voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system, reducing the release of neurotransmitters associated with pain signaling.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Etoricoxib + Pregabalin" is the generic name, several brand names exist depending on the manufacturer, including  Etorva-PG, Ethicox-PG, Mallicoxib-PG, Nutoxib P, Pregabalin-ET, and Starcoxia-PB.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Etoricoxib inhibits COX-2 enzymes, reducing prostaglandin production and thus inflammation and pain. Pregabalin binds to the α2δ subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, decreasing calcium influx into presynaptic nerve terminals, reducing the release of neurotransmitters such as glutamate, noradrenaline, and substance P, involved in pain transmission.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Both drugs are orally absorbed. Pregabalin's bioavailability is high (over 90%) and unaffected by food.  Etoricoxib reaches peak plasma concentration in about 1 hour.
*   **Metabolism:** Etoricoxib is primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP enzymes (mainly CYP3A4). Pregabalin undergoes minimal metabolism.
*   **Elimination:** Etoricoxib is primarily excreted via hepatic metabolism, with a small portion excreted unchanged in the urine.  Pregabalin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard dose is Etoricoxib 60 mg + Pregabalin 75 mg once daily. Some clinicians may prescribe a lower Pregabalin dose (50-75 mg/day) to minimize side effects. The dose may be increased to Etoricoxib 60 mg + Pregabalin 150 mg daily based on clinical response. Doses above 300 mg/day of pregabalin are generally not recommended due to increased adverse effects. Etoricoxib, when used alone for acute pain, is usually limited to 8 days of treatment.

#### **Children:**

Limited information is available regarding the pediatric use of this combination. Dosage adjustments based on weight or age would be required under strict medical supervision, considering potential adverse effects.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Caution is advised, with dose adjustments often necessary due to age-related changes in renal and hepatic function.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are crucial for pregabalin based on creatinine clearance. Etoricoxib should be used with caution in renal impairment.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustments are necessary for etoricoxib due to its hepatic metabolism. Pregabalin dosage adjustment is not typically required.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration is needed for patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or gastrointestinal issues, given the potential for adverse effects.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of etoricoxib and pregabalin is not typically employed in acute clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its use is primarily focused on managing chronic neuropathic pain, not acute pain or emergency conditions.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage modifications are based on renal and hepatic function, as outlined above.  Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism, particularly CYP3A4 activity for etoricoxib, might necessitate dose adjustments, but this requires specialized testing and expert guidance.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Dizziness, drowsiness, headache, dry mouth, peripheral edema, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, blurred vision, weight gain, difficulty concentrating.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions, cardiovascular events (with long-term etoricoxib use), vision changes, liver dysfunction, angioedema.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential long-term effects of etoricoxib include cardiovascular risks. Pregabalin's long-term effects can include peripheral edema and weight gain.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Serious ADRs include severe allergic reactions, angioedema, significant cardiovascular events, and severe liver dysfunction. These require immediate medical intervention.



## **Contraindications**

Absolute contraindications include active peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding, severe hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment (for etoricoxib), hypersensitivity to either drug. Relative contraindications include history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, pregnancy, and breastfeeding.

## **Drug Interactions**

Clinically significant drug interactions can occur with:

*   NSAIDs (like aspirin, ibuprofen): Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding with etoricoxib.
*   Anticoagulants (like warfarin): Increased bleeding risk with etoricoxib.
*   ACE inhibitors and diuretics: Potential for reduced antihypertensive effect with etoricoxib.
*   CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers: Can alter etoricoxib metabolism.
*   Alcohol: Increases risk of drowsiness and liver damage.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use of Etoricoxib + Pregabalin is generally not recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to limited safety data and potential risks to the fetus or infant.  Consult a specialist for individualized advice if the benefits outweigh the risks in specific situations.

## **Popular Combinations**

While etoricoxib and pregabalin are combined for their synergistic effects on neuropathic pain with an inflammatory component, this specific combination is typically prescribed as a fixed-dose combination. Adding other analgesics or medications requires careful evaluation due to potential interactions.

## **Precautions**

Screen patients for allergies, cardiovascular, liver, or kidney problems. Caution is advised in pregnancy, breastfeeding, children, and the elderly. Avoid alcohol. Monitor for drowsiness and avoid operating machinery.
