## **Usage**

Etoricoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) specifically indicated for the symptomatic relief of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, acute gouty arthritis, and acute pain management (including primary dysmenorrhea and post-operative dental pain).  Vitamin D3 is primarily used to treat and prevent vitamin D deficiency and associated conditions like rickets and osteomalacia. Although the combination isn't a standard therapeutic approach according to the sources provided, vitamin D3 may be used as a supplemental therapy in patients with chronic pain conditions alongside managing the pain with etoricoxib.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

*   Etoricoxib: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), COX-2 inhibitor
*   Vitamin D3: Fat-soluble vitamin, calcium regulator

**Mechanism of Action:**

Etoricoxib selectively inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme responsible for producing prostaglandins, which mediate inflammation and pain. Vitamin D3 regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis, promoting bone health.  It also influences the neuromuscular and immune systems. The combination aims to reduce pain and inflammation while addressing potential underlying vitamin D deficiency, potentially influencing chronic pain conditions like fibromyalgia and osteoporosis, as suggested by some studies.

## **Alternate Names**

*   Etoricoxib: None explicitly mentioned in the sources.
*   Vitamin D3: Cholecalciferol

**Brand Names:**

*   Etoricoxib: Arcoxia, Etorilum, Cuvexib, and numerous generic formulations.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

Etoricoxib exerts its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by selectively inhibiting COX-2. It does not inhibit COX-1, thus reducing the risk of gastrointestinal side effects associated with non-selective NSAIDs. Vitamin D3 acts as a hormone, influencing calcium absorption, bone mineralization, and cellular functions. It also modulates neuronal activity related to pain by regulating neurotransmitters like GABA and NT3, offering a potential co-analgesic effect alongside etoricoxib.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Etoricoxib:** Etoricoxib is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within approximately one hour. It is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP enzymes (CYP3A4), and eliminated through renal and biliary excretion. Its half-life is around 22 hours.
*   **Vitamin D3:** Vitamin D3 is absorbed from the gut and requires hepatic and renal activation to its active form, calcitriol. It is stored in adipose tissue and has a long half-life.

**Mode of Action:**

Etoricoxib binds to and inhibits COX-2, preventing prostaglandin synthesis. Vitamin D3 binds to the vitamin D receptor, influencing gene transcription and regulating various physiological processes.

**Elimination Pathways:**

Etoricoxib: Primarily hepatic metabolism followed by renal/biliary excretion.
Vitamin D3: Excreted via bile and feces.

## **Dosage**

The dosage recommendations for etoricoxib are condition-specific. Vitamin D3 dosage varies according to the deficiency and the specific clinical context. 

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (Etoricoxib):**

*   Osteoarthritis: 30-60 mg once daily.
*   Rheumatoid arthritis/Ankylosing Spondylitis: 60-90 mg once daily.
*   Acute gouty arthritis: 120 mg once daily (up to 8 days).
*   Acute pain: 90-120 mg once daily (up to 8 days).
*   Post-operative dental pain: 90 mg once daily (up to 3 days).

#### **Children (Etoricoxib):**

Contraindicated in children under 16.  Some limited evidence suggests use in children ≥40 kg, under strict specialist supervision and for less than 5 days, but this is not a standard practice.

#### **Special Cases (Etoricoxib):**

*   **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments, but caution is advised due to increased sensitivity to adverse events.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No adjustments necessary for creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min. Contraindicated in severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min).
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reductions are required for moderate to severe impairment.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring is essential for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other comorbidities.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Etoricoxib is not indicated for intubation, surgical procedures (except dental), mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations such as status epilepticus or cardiac arrest. It is purely for pain and inflammation management.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are crucial based on renal/hepatic dysfunction, and concurrent medications. Please refer to the detailed drug interaction section.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia), fluid retention, dizziness, headache, and fatigue.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Myocardial infarction, stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding/perforation, and severe allergic reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Increased risk of cardiovascular events and renal complications with prolonged use, especially at higher doses.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug-induced liver injury.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to etoricoxib, aspirin, or other NSAIDs; active peptic ulcer/gastrointestinal bleeding; severe heart failure; uncontrolled hypertension; established ischemic heart disease/cerebrovascular disease/peripheral arterial disease; perioperative coronary artery bypass grafting. Pregnancy and breastfeeding.

## **Drug Interactions**

Etoricoxib interacts with numerous medications, including anticoagulants (warfarin), antihypertensives (ACE inhibitors, ARBs), diuretics, lithium, methotrexate, rifampicin, and other NSAIDs.  Concomitant use should be carefully evaluated, and appropriate monitoring or dosage adjustments may be necessary. Also, certain medications and supplements can interfere with Vitamin D3's absorption or metabolism.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Etoricoxib is contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Vitamin D3 is often recommended during pregnancy and lactation, but dosage should be determined by a healthcare professional.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** Selective COX-2 inhibition.
*   **Side Effects:** GI upset, fluid retention, CV risks, GI bleeding.
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, active ulcer, pregnancy, severe heart/liver/renal disease.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, antihypertensives, lithium, other NSAIDs.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
