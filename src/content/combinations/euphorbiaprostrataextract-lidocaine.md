## **Usage**

Euphorbia Prostrata Extract + Lidocaine cream is prescribed for the topical management of painful anal fissures and fistulas associated with hemorrhoids (piles).  Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the rectum and anus, while anal fissures are small tears in the lining of the anus. This medication combines the hemostatic and anti-inflammatory properties of Euphorbia Prostrata extract with the local anesthetic action of Lidocaine.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This drug is classified as a topical anesthetic and anti-hemorrhoidal agent.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Euphorbia Prostrata extract helps shrink blood vessels, control bleeding, and reduce inflammation. Lidocaine provides local pain relief by blocking nerve signals.


## **Alternate Names** 

While no specific alternate generic names exist, the combination is often referred to as *Euphorbia Prostrata + Lidocaine* or *Euphorbia Prostrata and Lidocaine Cream*. Some brand names under which this combination is marketed include Sitcom LD and others.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Euphorbia Prostrata extract contains flavonoids, phenolic compounds, and tannins which possess anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antioxidant, hemostatic, antithrombotic, wound-healing, and vasoprotective properties. Lidocaine acts by stabilizing the neuronal membrane, inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses. This leads to a decrease in the sensation of pain and itching.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily applied topically, the absorption of Euphorbia Prostrata extract and Lidocaine through the rectal mucosa is limited, minimizing systemic exposure. However, some degree of systemic absorption is reported.  Specific details on the metabolism and elimination of Euphorbia Prostrata Extract are limited. Lidocaine is metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted by the kidneys.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**  
#### **Adults:**  

A small amount of cream should be applied to the affected anal area after each bowel movement, typically for up to 14 days.  An applicator may be provided with the cream for administration.


#### **Children:**  

The safety and efficacy of this medication in children have not been established, and its use is generally avoided in pediatric patients.


#### **Special Cases:**  
- **Elderly Patients**: Use with caution.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Avoid use due to potential complications related to Lidocaine metabolism.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Use with caution due to Lidocaine metabolism primarily occurring in the liver.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Use with caution in patients with bleeding disorders. Those on anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents should be closely monitored.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  

The primary clinical use case is the topical management of painful anal fissures and fistulas associated with hemorrhoids. Dosage is typically as described above, applied after each bowel movement for a period generally not exceeding two weeks. The use of this combination in settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU has not been established.


### **Dosage Adjustments**  

Dose adjustments are not generally recommended, as the medication is applied topically. However, caution is warranted in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction and those using anticoagulants.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**  

Burning or stinging sensation at the application site and redness are common side effects.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**  

Allergic reactions are possible, though rare. Symptoms may include rash, itching, shortness of breath, or swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat. Methemoglobinemia has been reported with Lidocaine use, particularly in susceptible individuals.


### **Long-Term Effects**  

Long-term effects are not well documented. Chronic complications from prolonged use are unlikely due to limited systemic absorption. However, continuous use beyond the recommended duration is discouraged.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions require immediate medical attention. Methemoglobinemia necessitates prompt intervention.
