## **Usage**

- Ezetimibe + Pitavastatin is prescribed for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and triglycerides (TG), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia) and mixed dyslipidemia, when response to diet and other non-pharmacological measures is inadequate.  It is also used to lower cholesterol in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and  to reduce high blood levels of plant-based sterols in people with homozygous sitosterolemia.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antihyperlipidemic agent, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin), cholesterol absorption inhibitor.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Ezetimibe inhibits the intestinal absorption of cholesterol. Pitavastatin inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme crucial for cholesterol synthesis in the liver, thereby reducing LDL-C production.


## **Alternate Names**

No widely used alternate names for the combination product exist. Brand names may vary regionally (Livazo, Lipvas, Ezetimibe/Pitavastatin).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ezetimibe selectively inhibits the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein, responsible for intestinal cholesterol absorption, without affecting the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins or triglycerides. Pitavastatin competitively inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, reducing hepatic cholesterol synthesis and increasing LDL receptor expression, which enhances LDL clearance from the bloodstream.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Ezetimibe is extensively metabolized in the small intestine and liver via glucuronidation. Pitavastatin is primarily metabolized by glucuronidation with minimal CYP involvement. Both drugs are excreted in feces and urine.
- **Mode of Action:** Ezetimibe acts on the brush border of the small intestine to block cholesterol absorption. Pitavastatin acts within hepatocytes to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Ezetimibe targets the NPC1L1 transporter. Pitavastatin inhibits HMG-CoA reductase.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Both drugs are eliminated through hepatic metabolism and excretion in bile and urine.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: Ezetimibe 10 mg + Pitavastatin 2 mg once daily.
- Titration:  Pitavastatin may be increased to 4mg daily based on LDL-C goals and patient response. Administer at the same time each day, preferably in the evening.

#### **Children:**

-  Limited safety and efficacy data are available for children under 10 years of age. Pitavastatin might be considered in children aged eight years and older with HeFH, starting with 2 mg once daily. 

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: No specific dose adjustment is typically needed, but initiate with caution due to potential for increased sensitivity.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Moderate to severe impairment: initiate Pitavastatin at 1 mg once daily, not exceeding 2mg.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations in liver transaminases contraindicate Ezetimibe + Pitavastatin. Mild impairment requires caution. Moderate to severe impairment is contraindicated.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Patients with diabetes or at risk of developing diabetes should be monitored closely.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

 Ezetimibe + Pitavastatin is primarily indicated for long-term management of hyperlipidemia and doesn't have specific dosage recommendations for acute clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient characteristics, including renal or hepatic dysfunction, concomitant medications, and response to therapy. Regular monitoring of liver enzymes and lipid profile is essential.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Headache, diarrhea, joint pain, muscle pain or tenderness (myalgia), weakness, pain in extremities.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, liver damage, allergic reactions.


### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential for chronic complications with long-term statin use needs ongoing assessment, with regular monitoring of liver enzymes, muscle function, and lipid profiles.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe muscle pain or weakness, dark urine, signs of liver injury (jaundice, abdominal pain), allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).



## **Contraindications**

- Active liver disease, unexplained persistent elevations in liver transaminases.
- Hypersensitivity to ezetimibe or pitavastatin.
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding.
- Concomitant use of cyclosporine.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Cyclosporine, gemfibrozil, erythromycin, rifampin, protease inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir, lopinavir/ritonavir), bile acid sequestrants, fibrates, and anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin). Close monitoring is required when co-administering these drugs.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding due to the potential for fetal harm and unknown effects on infants.



## **Drug Profile Summary**
