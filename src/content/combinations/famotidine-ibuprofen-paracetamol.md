## **Usage**

This combination is not a standard, FDA-approved medication. While famotidine, ibuprofen, and paracetamol are individual drugs often prescribed and used together, they are not available as a single, combined pill or formulation. Therefore, information provided here relates to the usage of each drug individually and in combination, not as a unified product.

* **Famotidine:**  Belongs to the histamine H2-receptor antagonists class. It reduces stomach acid production. Used for heartburn, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and ulcers.
* **Ibuprofen:** Belongs to the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) class.  It reduces pain, fever, and inflammation. Used for conditions like headaches, menstrual cramps, arthritis, and other types of pain.
* **Paracetamol:** Belongs to the analgesics and antipyretics class.  It reduces fever and pain. Used for fever, headaches, and other mild to moderate pain.

This combination is intended for use in patients experiencing pain conditions along with heightened risk of developing ulcers or those who require the long-term use of an NSAID like ibuprofen. Famotidine is included to mitigate the risk of ulcer development associated with NSAID use.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination doesn't have an international nonproprietary name (INN) as it is not a recognized combined medication.  Individually:

* **Famotidine:** Pepcid, Pepcid AC
* **Ibuprofen:** Advil, Motrin, Nurofen
* **Paracetamol:** Acetaminophen (US, Canada), Tylenol, Panadol

A combined medication containing famotidine and ibuprofen is marketed under the brand name Duexis.  Duexis does *not* contain paracetamol.

## **How It Works**

* **Famotidine:** Reversibly inhibits the action of histamine at the H2 receptors of the parietal cells in the stomach, thus decreasing gastric acid secretion.  Metabolized minimally, primarily excreted renally.
* **Ibuprofen:** Non-selectively inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, thus decreasing inflammation and pain. Metabolized hepatically, excreted renally.
* **Paracetamol:**  Mechanism not fully understood. Thought to inhibit COX enzymes in the central nervous system, but with minimal peripheral effects. It also acts on the hypothalamic heat-regulating center to reduce fever.  Metabolized hepatically, excreted renally.

As this specific drug combination is not an official pharmaceutical product, dosage information applies to separate administration.
