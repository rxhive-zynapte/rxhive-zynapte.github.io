## **Usage**

Fenofibrate + Metformin is a combination medication primarily prescribed for the management of mixed dyslipidemia (high cholesterol and high triglycerides) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It belongs to the pharmacological classifications of fibrates (Fenofibrate) and biguanides (Metformin).

Fenofibrate activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α), leading to increased lipoprotein lipase activity, which breaks down triglycerides. It also reduces hepatic production of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Metformin improves insulin sensitivity, reducing hepatic glucose production and enhancing peripheral glucose uptake.

## **Alternate Names**

No commonly used alternate names exist for the combination itself. However, the individual components have various brand names, including Antara®, Fenoglide®, Lipofen®, Lofibra®, TriCor®, and Triglide® for Fenofibrate, and Glucophage®, Fortamet®, Glumetza®, and Riomet® for Metformin. Numerous generic formulations also exist for both medications.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Fenofibrate primarily affects lipid metabolism by activating PPAR-α. This leads to a decrease in triglycerides, VLDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B levels, along with an increase in HDL cholesterol. Metformin primarily decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Fenofibrate is readily absorbed orally, particularly when taken with food. It is extensively metabolized in the liver, mainly to fenofibric acid, its active metabolite.  Elimination primarily occurs via the kidneys. Metformin is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with negligible metabolism in the liver. It is excreted unchanged by the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:**  Fenofibrate's activation of PPAR-α results in increased lipoprotein lipase activity, which hydrolyzes triglycerides in circulating lipoproteins.  Metformin's exact mechanism is not fully understood but involves activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key enzyme in cellular energy homeostasis. This leads to a cascade of effects impacting glucose production and utilization.

**Elimination Pathways:** Fenofibrate, primarily as its metabolite fenofibric acid, is eliminated mainly through renal excretion. Metformin is excreted unchanged primarily via the kidneys.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The dosage of the combination medication is individualized based on the patient's specific lipid and glycemic control needs. Typically, it involves taking the individual components of Fenofibrate and Metformin. Fenofibrate dosage ranges from 40 mg to 160 mg once daily, depending on the specific formulation and the condition being treated. Metformin is usually started at 500 mg twice daily or 850 mg once daily and can be titrated up to a maximum of 2550 mg daily in divided doses. It is important to consult the prescribing information for the specific product being used.

#### **Children:**

The combination is generally not recommended for pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments should be considered based on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction or avoidance is recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. 
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Fenofibrate dosage should be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment. Metformin is contraindicated in patients with severe liver disease.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments might be required based on other existing medical conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of Fenofibrate and Metformin is not specifically indicated for use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments should be made based on patient-specific factors such as renal function, hepatic function, and concomitant medications. 


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Gastrointestinal issues (e.g., diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain)
* Headache
* Back pain
* Upper respiratory tract infection

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis
* Pancreatitis
* Cholelithiasis (gallstones)
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
* Lactic acidosis (with Metformin, especially in patients with renal impairment)

### **Long-Term Effects:** 

* Potential for gallstones with long-term Fenofibrate use.
* Vitamin B12 deficiency with long-term Metformin use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

* Severe allergic reactions (rare)


## **Contraindications:**

* Severe renal impairment
* Active liver disease
* Preexisting gallbladder disease
* Hypersensitivity to fenofibrate or metformin
* Nursing mothers


## **Drug Interactions**

* Coumarin anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin): Increased risk of bleeding
* Bile acid sequestrants: Reduced absorption of fenofibrate
* HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins): Increased risk of myopathy with gemfibrozil, though less so with fenofibrate
* Other drugs that affect renal function: Increased risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Fenofibrate is generally avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential risks to the fetus or infant. Metformin can be used in pregnancy under careful monitoring but is generally avoided during breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Fenofibrate activates PPAR-α, reducing triglycerides and increasing HDL. Metformin increases insulin sensitivity, reducing hepatic glucose production.
* **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, myopathy, pancreatitis, cholelithiasis, lactic acidosis.
* **Contraindications:** Severe renal or liver disease, gallbladder disease.
* **Drug Interactions:** Coumarin anticoagulants, bile acid sequestrants, some statins.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Generally avoided.
* **Dosage:**  Individualized based on lipid/glycemic goals.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Lipid panel, liver function tests, renal function tests, HbA1c.



## **Popular Combinations**

Fenofibrate + Metformin is itself a popular combination.  Sometimes, other agents like statins may be added to further improve lipid control.

## **Precautions**

* Renal function monitoring is crucial, especially in elderly patients and those with diabetes.
* Monitor liver function tests.
* Assess for gallbladder disease before and during treatment.
