      **A:** The combination can address multiple lipid abnormalities
      simultaneously, improving overall lipid profiles beyond what either drug
      can achieve alone. This can lead to better cardiovascular risk reduction
      in patients with mixed dyslipidemia.

      initiated at a lower dose (1 mg) and limited to a maximum of 2 mg daily in
      moderate to severe renal impairment.

## **Usage**

Fenofibrate + Pitavastatin is a combination drug prescribed for the management of mixed dyslipidemia, characterized by elevated levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and apolipoprotein B, along with low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). It combines a fibrate (fenofibrate) and a statin (pitavastatin).

- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Hypolipidemic agent (combination of a fibrate and a statin)

- **Mechanism of Action:** Fenofibrate activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), leading to increased lipoprotein lipase activity, reduced hepatic very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) production, and enhanced triglyceride clearance. Pitavastatin inhibits 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, lowering LDL-C.

## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for the combination product itself. However, the individual components have various names:

- **Fenofibrate:** Tricor, Fenoglide, Antara, Lofibra
- **Pitavastatin:** Livalo, Zypitamag

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Fenofibrate primarily affects triglyceride metabolism, while pitavastatin lowers cholesterol levels. Together, they improve overall lipid profiles.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Fenofibrate:** Well-absorbed orally, highly protein-bound, metabolized to fenofibric acid, primarily excreted in urine.
    - **Pitavastatin:** Well-absorbed orally, extensively metabolized by glucuronidation, primarily excreted in feces.
- **Mode of Action:** Fenofibrate activates PPARα, regulating lipid metabolism. Pitavastatin competitively inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, reducing cholesterol synthesis.
- **Receptor binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Fenofibrate binds to PPARα. Pitavastatin inhibits HMG-CoA reductase.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Fenofibrate mainly undergoes renal excretion, while pitavastatin undergoes hepatic excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Fenofibrate:** Micronized formulation: 130-160 mg orally once daily.
- **Pitavastatin:**  2 mg orally once daily, adjustable up to 4 mg daily based on LDL-C goals and patient response.

*Note that these are starting doses and should be adjusted after 4-8 weeks based on individual patient response and goals.*

#### **Children:**

Pitavastatin is approved for children aged 8 years and older with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), starting at 1-2 mg daily. Fenofibrate is generally not recommended for children.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate with lower doses of both drugs and monitor closely.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    - **Fenofibrate:** Contraindicated in severe renal impairment. Use with caution and dose reduction in moderate impairment.
    - **Pitavastatin:** Initiate at 1 mg daily, maximum 2 mg daily in moderate to severe impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
    - **Fenofibrate:** Use with caution and monitor liver function tests.
    - **Pitavastatin:** Contraindicated in active liver disease or unexplained elevated liver enzymes.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized dosing and close monitoring are crucial in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or other relevant conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its primary use is for chronic lipid management.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are made based on lipid response, renal/hepatic function, drug interactions, and other patient-specific factors. Consult drug interaction checkers for potential interactions and necessary modifications.

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Myalgia, gastrointestinal upset (dyspepsia, abdominal pain), elevated liver enzymes, headache.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Rhabdomyolysis, myopathy, liver injury, pancreatitis, cholelithiasis.


### **Long-Term Effects**

- Potential for muscle and liver damage with prolonged use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure.

## **Contraindications**

- Severe renal dysfunction, active liver disease, gallbladder disease, hypersensitivity to either drug, pregnancy, breastfeeding, concomitant use with cyclosporine.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Statins interact with numerous drugs including:
    - CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin, some azole antifungals): Increase statin levels and myopathy risk.
    - CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin): Decrease statin efficacy.
- Fibrates interact with:
    - Bile acid sequestrants: Reduced fibrate absorption.
    - Anticoagulants: Increased bleeding risk.
- The combination increases the risk of myopathy.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Contraindicated.
- **Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Fenofibrate: PPARα agonist; Pitavastatin: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.
- **Side Effects:** Myalgia, gastrointestinal upset, increased liver enzymes.
- **Contraindications:** Severe renal/liver disease, gallbladder disease, pregnancy, breastfeeding.
- **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers, bile acid sequestrants, anticoagulants.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
- **Dosage:** Adults: Fenofibrate 130-160 mg/day, Pitavastatin 2-4 mg/day; individualize and adjust based on response.
