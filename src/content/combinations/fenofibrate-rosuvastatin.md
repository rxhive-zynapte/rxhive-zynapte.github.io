## **Usage**

Fenofibrate + Rosuvastatin is a combination medication prescribed to manage mixed dyslipidemia, a condition characterized by elevated levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), and apolipoprotein B (Apo B), along with decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). This combination therapy is considered when statin monotherapy (e.g., Rosuvastatin alone) fails to achieve optimal lipid control. It belongs to the pharmacological class of lipid-lowering agents, specifically combining a statin (Rosuvastatin) with a fibrate (Fenofibrate).

Rosuvastatin inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme crucial for cholesterol synthesis in the liver. This action reduces the production of cholesterol, leading to lower LDL-C levels. Fenofibrate, a PPAR-α agonist, increases lipoprotein lipase activity, facilitating the breakdown and clearance of triglycerides. It also enhances HDL-C levels.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Fenofibrate + Rosuvastatin" is the standard generic name, the specific brand name can vary depending on the manufacturer and region. Some common brand names include Rosufen.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Rosuvastatin competitively inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, reducing cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver. This, in turn, lowers circulating LDL-C levels. Fenofibrate activates PPAR-α, leading to increased lipoprotein lipase activity.  This action promotes triglyceride hydrolysis and lowers VLDL-C levels. It also increases Apo A-I and Apo A-II synthesis, thereby increasing HDL-C.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Both Rosuvastatin and Fenofibrate are administered orally. Rosuvastatin reaches peak plasma concentration in about 5 hours, while Fenofibrate achieves peak levels in 2 to 4 hours. Rosuvastatin is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9, and Fenofibrate is hydrolyzed to fenofibric acid, which is mainly glucuronidated. Both drugs are primarily excreted through the biliary route, with some renal excretion.

**Mode of Action:**  Rosuvastatin acts through competitive inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. Fenofibrate exerts its effect by activating PPAR-α, a nuclear receptor involved in lipid metabolism. This activation upregulates lipoprotein lipase and increases Apo A-I and Apo A-II production.

**Elimination Pathways:** Rosuvastatin is primarily excreted in bile, with a minor fraction undergoing renal excretion. Fenofibrate's active metabolite, fenofibric acid, is mostly glucuronidated and excreted in bile, with some renal elimination.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  The recommended starting dose is one tablet containing 10 mg of Rosuvastatin and 145 mg of Fenofibrate once daily, taken orally after dinner. The dose can be adjusted based on individual response and tolerability, but the maximum recommended dose of Rosuvastatin is 40 mg and Fenofibrate is 160 mg.

#### **Children:**  This combination is not recommended for pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary based on renal function.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  For moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance <60 mL/min), the initial Rosuvastatin dose should not exceed 5mg, and the 40 mg dose is contraindicated.  The combination product may not be suitable for these patients.  Fenofibrate requires dose adjustment in moderate renal impairment. The combination is contraindicated in severe renal impairment.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dose adjustment is needed for patients with hepatic impairment. Rosuvastatin should be used cautiously, starting with a lower dose (5-10 mg) in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. The use of Fenofibrate + Rosuvastatin is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or unexplained persistent liver function abnormalities.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised in patients with diabetes, hypothyroidism, and other metabolic disorders.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of Fenofibrate and Rosuvastatin is specifically indicated for managing mixed dyslipidemia as an adjunct to diet and lifestyle modifications. It is not typically used in the context of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on individual response to therapy, renal function, hepatic function, and concomitant medications. Regular monitoring of lipid levels and liver function tests is essential.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:** Myalgia, gastrointestinal discomfort (constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain), headache, back pain, elevated liver enzymes.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**  Rhabdomyolysis, myopathy, hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, cholelithiasis.

### **Long-Term Effects:**  Potential long-term effects include muscle damage, liver damage, and gallbladder issues. Regular monitoring is crucial.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Serious ADRs include rhabdomyolysis, liver failure, and severe allergic reactions.


## **Contraindications**

Absolute contraindications include hypersensitivity to either drug, severe renal impairment, active liver disease, gallbladder disease, and concurrent use of certain medications like gemfibrozil.  Relative contraindications include moderate renal or hepatic impairment, hypothyroidism, and pregnancy.

## **Drug Interactions**

Significant drug interactions can occur with cyclosporine, certain antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin), antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole), HIV protease inhibitors, gemfibrozil, and other fibrates.  Concomitant use of bile acid sequestrants can decrease the absorption of Rosuvastatin.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

This combination is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to the potential for fetal harm.
