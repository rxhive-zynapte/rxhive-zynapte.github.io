## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the treatment and prevention of nutritional deficiencies, predominantly iron-deficiency anemia, megaloblastic anemia (caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiency), and during pregnancy to ensure adequate levels of iron, folate, and vitamin B12.  It helps restore iron levels, supports red blood cell production, and promotes nerve health.  It is also prescribed in general to improve overall health and wellbeing.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Hematinic, Vitamin Supplement, Antianemic


## **Alternate Names** 

- Iron Asparto Glycinate + L-Methylfolate + Methylcobalamin
- Ferrous(II) Asparto Glycinate + (6S)-5-Methyltetrahydrofolic acid + Methylcobalamin

Some brand names for this combination include Fag HB Softgel Capsule, Fagwell Tablet and Finered Tablet. It's important to note that brand names can vary regionally.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

- **Ferrous Asparto Glycinate:** Delivers iron, which is crucial for hemoglobin synthesis within red blood cells. Hemoglobin is the protein responsible for oxygen transport throughout the body.  It is a readily absorbable form of iron, thus beneficial in treating iron deficiency.
- **L-Methyl Folate:** The biologically active form of folate, also known as Vitamin B9, essential for DNA synthesis, cell division, and red blood cell maturation.  It plays a critical role in preventing neural tube defects during fetal development.  It is preferred over folic acid in individuals with certain genetic polymorphisms related to folate metabolism.
- **Methylcobalamin:** The active coenzyme form of Vitamin B12, vital for nerve function, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell maturation. It aids in the synthesis of myelin, a protective sheath around nerve fibers, and participates in nerve cell repair. It also aids in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine.


**Pharmacokinetics:**

- **Absorption:** Ferrous asparto glycinate is absorbed in the small intestine.  L-methylfolate is absorbed primarily in the jejunum, and methylcobalamin is absorbed via intrinsic factor-mediated transport in the ileum.
- **Metabolism:**  Methylcobalamin is stored in the liver and is not extensively metabolized.  L-methylfolate undergoes metabolic conversion to tetrahydrofolic acid, the active form of folate.  Iron is incorporated into hemoglobin.
- **Elimination:** Iron is primarily lost through blood loss and shedding of epithelial cells. Excess folate is excreted in the urine, and excess Vitamin B12 is excreted in the bile and urine.


## **Dosage**

Dosage guidelines for Ferrous asparto glycinate + L-Methyl Folate + Methylcobalamin can vary depending on the patient's specific needs, severity of deficiency, and the formulation of the medicine. It is crucial to follow the dosage instructions given by the doctor and printed on the package. However, some general dosage information can be mentioned.



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The typical dosage for adults is one capsule or tablet daily or as directed by the physician.  It's crucial to monitor blood levels of iron, vitamin B12, and folate to adjust the dosage as needed. The dosage may vary based on the severity of the deficiency.

#### **Children:**

Dosage for children should be determined by a pediatrician based on the child's age, weight, and clinical condition.  The safety and efficacy of this combination in children have not been fully established for all age groups.



#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary due to age-related changes in kidney and liver function.
