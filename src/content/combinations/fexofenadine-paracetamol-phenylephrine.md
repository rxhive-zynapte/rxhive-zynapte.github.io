## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of common cold and allergy symptoms, including rhinitis (with or without nasal congestion), rhinopharyngitis, tonsillitis, runny nose, sneezing, itchy or watery eyes, nasal congestion, sore throat, fever, and body aches.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing an antihistamine (fexofenadine), an analgesic and antipyretic (paracetamol), and a decongestant (phenylephrine).

## **Alternate Names**
- While the generic name is Fexofenadine + Paracetamol + Phenylephrine, regional or international variations may exist.
- **Brand Names:** This combination is marketed under various brand names, including CNF Activ, FPP Active and others.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Fexofenadine, a second-generation antihistamine, selectively antagonizes peripheral histamine H1-receptors, mitigating allergic symptoms. Paracetamol inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing pain and fever. Phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, constricts blood vessels in the nasal mucosa, relieving congestion.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Fexofenadine is absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1-3 hours. It undergoes minimal metabolism and is primarily excreted unchanged in feces and urine. Paracetamol is rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolized in the liver, with excretion primarily via the kidneys. Phenylephrine is absorbed orally but undergoes significant first-pass metabolism, resulting in lower bioavailability. It is metabolized by monoamine oxidase and excreted in urine.
