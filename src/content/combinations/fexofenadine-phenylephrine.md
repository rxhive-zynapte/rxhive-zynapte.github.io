## **Usage**

- Fexofenadine + Phenylephrine is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of allergic rhinitis and the common cold.  It helps relieve symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, itchy or watery eyes, and nasal congestion.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination drug falls under the classifications of antihistamines and decongestants. Fexofenadine is a second-generation antihistamine, while Phenylephrine is a decongestant.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Fexofenadine works by selectively blocking peripheral histamine H1-receptors, thus reducing the effects of histamine released during an allergic reaction. Phenylephrine acts as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, constricting blood vessels in the nasal mucosa, which reduces swelling and congestion.

## **Alternate Names**

- While there aren't specific alternate generic names, regional variations may exist.
- **Brand Names:**  The combination is marketed under various brand names, including Allegra-D®, Telfast-D®, and various generic formulations.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Fexofenadine exerts its effect by competitively antagonizing the H1-receptor, preventing histamine from binding and triggering the allergic cascade. Phenylephrine, through its alpha-1 adrenergic agonism, constricts blood vessels, leading to decongestion. 
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Fexofenadine is absorbed orally and reaches peak plasma concentration within 1-3 hours. It undergoes minimal metabolism and is primarily excreted unchanged in feces and urine. Phenylephrine is also absorbed orally, but its bioavailability is low due to extensive first-pass metabolism. It is metabolized by monoamine oxidase and excreted in urine.
- **Mode of Action:** Fexofenadine acts by binding to the H1-receptor, preventing the downstream effects of histamine, such as vasodilation and increased vascular permeability. Phenylephrine stimulates alpha-1 adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle, causing vasoconstriction.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Fexofenadine is eliminated primarily through biliary excretion (feces) with a small portion renally excreted. Phenylephrine undergoes metabolism by monoamine oxidase, with subsequent renal excretion of metabolites.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The typical adult dose is one 180 mg tablet of Fexofenadine with 240 mg of pseudoephedrine once daily or one 60 mg tablet of fexofenadine with 120 mg pseudoephedrine twice daily.

#### **Children:**

- For children aged 2 to 11 years for seasonal allergic rhinitis, fexofenadine 30 mg twice daily is recommended. Combination with phenylephrine is generally not advised for younger children. Always consult pediatric dosing guidelines before prescribing.
- Pediatric safety considerations include careful monitoring for side effects, particularly those related to the central nervous system.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Dose adjustments may be necessary, especially in patients with renal impairment. Start with the lower end of the dosing range and monitor carefully.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** For patients with creatinine clearance less than 80 mL/min, a reduced dose of Fexofenadine (60mg once daily) is recommended.  Phenylephrine should be used cautiously.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Data on dose adjustments in hepatic dysfunction is limited.  Close monitoring is advisable.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution should be exercised in patients with diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, or closed-angle glaucoma.  Dosage adjustments may be required.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- This particular drug combination isn't typically employed in scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU care, or emergency situations. Other medications are usually preferred for these contexts.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments are crucial in patients with renal impairment.
- Hepatic dysfunction may necessitate closer monitoring and potential dose modification.
- Patients with metabolic disorders or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism require careful evaluation and potential dose adjustments.
