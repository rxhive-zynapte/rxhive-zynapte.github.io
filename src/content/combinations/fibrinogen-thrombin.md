      How does Fibrinogen + Thrombin work to stop bleeding?**


      **A:**  Thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin, creating a clot that seals
      the bleeding area.  Some formulations include aprotinin, which helps
      stabilize the clot by preventing its breakdown.

## **Usage**

Fibrinogen + Thrombin is prescribed as an adjunct to hemostasis for mild-to-moderate bleeding in adults undergoing surgery when standard surgical techniques (e.g., suture, ligature, cautery) are ineffective or impractical.  It is classified as a hemostatic agent and fibrin sealant.  The medication mimics the final steps of the physiological coagulation cascade to achieve hemostasis.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination product is commonly referred to as Fibrin Glue or Fibrin Sealant. Brand names include Raplixa, Evicel, TachoSil, and Veraseal.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Fibrinogen and thrombin are combined to form a fibrin clot, mimicking the final step of the coagulation cascade. The resulting clot seals the bleeding site and promotes hemostasis.  Aprotinin, sometimes included in fibrin sealant products, is an antifibrinolytic agent that inhibits the breakdown of the clot.

**Pharmacokinetics:** When applied topically, fibrinogen and thrombin react locally to form the fibrin clot.  The clot is eventually broken down through the normal fibrinolytic processes. As a topical agent, it does not have systemic pharmacokinetics in the same way as oral or intravenous medications.  Any small amount of the components absorbed does not contribute significantly to overall drug effects.

**Mode of Action:** Thrombin catalyzes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin monomers.  These monomers polymerize to form a fibrin clot, which adheres to the surrounding tissue and provides hemostasis.  Aprotinin, when included, prevents premature clot breakdown by inhibiting plasmin.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Thrombin acts as a serine protease, specifically cleaving fibrinogen.  Aprotinin inhibits serine proteases involved in fibrinolysis, such as plasmin and kallikrein.

**Elimination Pathways:** The fibrin clot formed at the application site is broken down by the body's natural fibrinolytic system. The byproducts are eliminated through the normal metabolic pathways.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The dose varies based on the size of the bleeding area, not exceeding a total of 3g per surgery.

*   **Direct application:**  0.5g for up to 25 cm², 1g for up to 50 cm², and 2g for up to 100 cm².

*   **Spray application:**  0.5g for up to 50 cm², 1g for up to 100 cm², and 2g for up to 200 cm².

#### **Children:** Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:** No specific dosage adjustments for elderly, renally impaired, or hepatically impaired patients are mentioned in the available information.  Dose adjustment should be done according to the clinician's evaluation of bleeding severity, patient condition and comorbid conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific clinical situations follows the general adult dosage guidelines and is adjusted according to the size of the bleeding area:

*   Intubation: Not specifically indicated.
*   Surgical Procedures:  Follow general adult guidelines.
*   Mechanical Ventilation: Not specifically indicated.
*   Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use: Follow general adult guidelines.
*   Emergency Situations: Follow general adult guidelines.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on the bleeding area size. Considerations for organ dysfunction and other patient-specific factors are based on clinician judgment.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Procedural pain, nausea, constipation, incision site pain, fever, anemia, vomiting, hypotension, itching, hypertension, and antithrombin antibodies.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Allergic reactions (hives, generalized urticaria, tightness of chest, wheezing, hypotension, and anaphylaxis), thromboembolic events (especially with intravascular application), and air or gas embolism (with spray application).


### **Long-Term Effects:**  Not typically associated with long-term adverse effects as it is a topical application.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Anaphylaxis and thromboembolic events are serious ADRs that require immediate medical attention.



## **Contraindications**
