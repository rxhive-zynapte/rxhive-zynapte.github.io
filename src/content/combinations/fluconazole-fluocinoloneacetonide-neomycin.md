## **Usage**

This combination is prescribed for inflammatory skin conditions complicated by secondary bacterial and fungal infections.  It is effective against dermatoses, eczema, dermatitis, psoriasis and conditions where secondary bacterial infection is present or likely to occur.

It's **pharmacological classifications** are:  Antifungal (Fluconazole), Corticosteroid (Fluocinolone acetonide), and Antibiotic (Neomycin).

Fluconazole inhibits fungal cell wall synthesis. Fluocinolone acetonide reduces inflammation and itching. Neomycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis.


## **Alternate Names** 

An alternate name for a similar combination (Fluocinolone acetonide + Neomycin) is Neo-Synalar.  This specific triple combination is less common as a fixed-dose product and doesn't have a widely recognized single brand name.  Often, it's prepared as a compounded medication using the generic names.


## **How It Works**

**Fluconazole:** Inhibits the fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme, thus disrupting the synthesis of ergosterol, an essential part of the fungal cell membrane.

**Fluocinolone acetonide:**  A corticosteroid that binds to glucocorticoid receptors. This action reduces inflammation by suppressing the movement of white blood cells to the inflamed site and inhibiting phospholipase A2, which in turn decreases the creation of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes.

**Neomycin:** An aminoglycoside antibiotic that binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria, blocking protein synthesis.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily topical action with limited systemic absorption. More specific data on the combination product's metabolism and excretion are limited. Elimination pathways for individual components vary: Fluconazole is primarily renally excreted, fluocinolone acetonide undergoes hepatic metabolism, and neomycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Apply a thin layer to the affected area 2â€“4 times daily. Treatment duration depends on the severity and location of the infection (typically a few days to several weeks). Maximum dose and duration should be determined by a physician.

#### **Children:** Use in children should be under strict medical supervision due to potential side effects like growth retardation. Dosage adjustments based on age and body weight are required. Safety and efficacy in children younger than 2 years old haven't been established for this combination.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Close monitoring for local and systemic side effects is crucial due to age-related decline in organ function, specifically renal.  Start with the lowest effective dose and adjust cautiously.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Fluconazole dosage adjustments are needed based on creatinine clearance. Use neomycin with caution because of potential nephrotoxicity.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Adjust fluconazole dosage in cases of severe hepatic impairment as it's primarily metabolized by the liver.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor diabetic patients for potential blood sugar increase from fluocinolone acetonide. Caution in patients with adrenal gland disorders or Cushing's syndrome.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

This topical medication is *not* suitable for systemic conditions requiring intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  It is exclusively for topical skin infections.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are based on the infection's severity, the patient's response, and underlying medical conditions. Renal and hepatic impairment necessitate dose adjustments for fluconazole and careful consideration for neomycin.  Avoid prolonged use due to risks like skin atrophy, systemic corticosteroid absorption, and antibiotic resistance.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Burning or stinging at the application site
- Itching, irritation, dryness, and redness of the skin
- Skin atrophy (thinning) with prolonged use
- Hypopigmentation (lightening of the skin)
- Increased hair growth
- Changes in skin color



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic contact dermatitis (especially to neomycin)
- Systemic absorption of the corticosteroid, potentially leading to Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and adrenal suppression
- Hearing problems, ringing in the ears (ototoxicity from neomycin)
- Kidney damage (nephrotoxicity from neomycin)



### **Long-Term Effects**

- Skin atrophy, telangiectasia (spider veins), striae (stretch marks)
- Increased risk of secondary infections with prolonged use
- Depigmentation or hyperpigmentation of the skin



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) to neomycin


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any component (fluconazole, fluocinolone acetonide, or neomycin)
- Viral skin infections (herpes simplex, varicella zoster)
- Tuberculosis of the skin
- Rosacea, acne, perioral dermatitis
- Open wounds or broken skin


## **Drug Interactions**

- **Fluconazole:**  Numerous interactions with drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system (e.g., warfarin, cyclosporine, statins, oral hypoglycemics, phenytoin).  Can increase levels of certain medications.
- **Fluocinolone acetonide:**  May interact with other topical medications.  Systemic absorption can interact with certain drugs.
- **Neomycin:**  Can enhance the effects of neuromuscular blocking agents.  May interact with certain antibiotics and other topical medications.
- Interactions with other medications are possible, so thorough medication reconciliation is necessary. Concurrent use of topical products on the same area should be done cautiously.




## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Fluconazole is generally not recommended during pregnancy, especially high doses, due to the potential for fetal harm (teratogenicity).  Low doses for short durations may be acceptable in some cases if the benefits outweigh the risks.  Fluocinolone and neomycin have limited data regarding pregnancy safety.  

All three components can be excreted in breast milk, potentially posing risks to the infant.  Consult with a physician to weigh the benefits and risks if use is considered during breastfeeding.  If applied topically to the chest, avoid areas that may come into contact with the baby's mouth.

## **Popular Combinations**

This particular triple combination isn't a commonly available fixed-dose product.  However, combinations of corticosteroids and antibiotics (like Neo-Synalar) or corticosteroids and antifungals are frequently used in dermatology.


## **Precautions**
