## **Usage**

Fluconazole + Tinidazole is prescribed for the treatment of vaginal infections, such as vulvovaginal candidiasis (vaginal yeast infection), trichomoniasis, and bacterial vaginosis.  It combines an antifungal (Fluconazole) and an antiprotozoal/antibacterial (Tinidazole) to address mixed vaginal infections.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Antifungal and antiprotozoal/antibacterial combination.

**Mechanism of Action:** Fluconazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis, a critical component of fungal cell membranes, leading to fungal cell death.  Tinidazole disrupts DNA synthesis and structure in susceptible protozoa and bacteria, inhibiting their growth and leading to their elimination.


## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for the combination product itself. However, the individual components have alternate names:

* **Fluconazole:** Diflucan (brand name)
* **Tinidazole:** Tindamax (brand name), Fasigyn (brand name)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Fluconazole selectively inhibits fungal cytochrome P-450 enzymes, disrupting ergosterol synthesis and resulting in fungal cell membrane damage.  Tinidazole interacts with DNA, causing strand breakage and inhibiting nucleic acid synthesis in susceptible organisms.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Fluconazole:**  Well-absorbed orally, with high bioavailability.  Penetrates most tissues and fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid.  Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.
* **Tinidazole:**  Well-absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver. Eliminated via renal and fecal pathways.


**Mode of Action:** Fluconazole:  Inhibition of fungal cytochrome P-450-dependent enzymes responsible for ergosterol synthesis.  Tinidazole:  Damage to DNA and inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis.


**Elimination Pathways:**

* **Fluconazole:** Predominantly renal excretion.
* **Tinidazole:** Renal and fecal excretion.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The standard dosage for vaginal infections is typically a single dose of Fluconazole 150 mg and Tinidazole 2 g taken orally at the same time. Some regimens may involve multiple doses of Tinidazole.

#### **Children:** Fluconazole + Tinidazole is generally not recommended for children under 12 years of age for bacterial infections. For other infections, dosing should be determined by a pediatrician and based on weight, age, and the specific infection being treated.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary due to age-related decline in renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction or increased dosing interval may be necessary in patients with impaired renal function.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, and dose adjustments may be required in patients with liver disease.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider potential drug interactions with concomitant medications.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical use cases outside of vaginal infections should be individualized and guided by clinical expertise and patient factors.  The combination is not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments should be made based on renal/hepatic function, other medical conditions, and concomitant medications.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, abdominal pain or cramps, skin rash, itching, loss of appetite, dizziness, metallic taste.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome), hepatotoxicity (jaundice), blood dyscrasias (leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), seizures, peripheral neuropathy.


### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic complications are rare with short-term use for vaginal infections.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Anaphylaxis, angioedema, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.




## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to Fluconazole, Tinidazole, or other azole antifungals or nitroimidazole derivatives; first trimester of pregnancy;  concurrent use with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, terfenadine); history of blood dyscrasias, liver disease, neuropathy.



## **Drug Interactions**

Alcohol (disulfiram-like reaction), warfarin (increased risk of bleeding),  oral hypoglycemics (enhanced hypoglycemic effect), phenytoin (increased phenytoin levels), cyclosporine and tacrolimus (increased levels),  theophylline (increased theophylline levels).



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy.  Use with caution during the second and third trimesters only if clearly needed.  Tinidazole is excreted in breast milk. Breastfeeding should be discontinued during and for 3 days after treatment.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Fluconazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis; Tinidazole damages DNA.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, abdominal pain, rash, itching, dizziness.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, first trimester pregnancy, certain drug interactions.
* **Drug Interactions:** Alcohol, warfarin, oral hypoglycemics, phenytoin, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, theophylline.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in the first trimester; caution in later trimesters; avoid breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** Single dose of 150 mg Fluconazole and 2 g Tinidazole for vaginal infections.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests, complete blood count.


## **Popular Combinations**

This combination itself is a popular combination used specifically for mixed vaginal infections where both fungal and bacterial/protozoal infections are suspected.

## **Precautions**

Assess for allergies, renal/hepatic function, and drug interactions.  Avoid alcohol during and for several days after treatment.  Caution in patients with neurologic disorders.  Exercise caution when driving or operating machinery due to potential dizziness.
