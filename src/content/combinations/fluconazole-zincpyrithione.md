## **Usage**

Fluconazole + Zinc pyrithione is prescribed for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis, dandruff, and other fungal skin infections.  It combines the antifungal action of fluconazole with the antibacterial and antifungal properties of zinc pyrithione. This dual action makes it effective against a broad range of fungi and bacteria that contribute to these skin conditions. This combination falls under the pharmacological classifications of antifungals and antibacterials.

Fluconazole, a triazole antifungal, inhibits the fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme 14α-demethylase, disrupting ergosterol synthesis, a crucial component of the fungal cell membrane. Zinc pyrithione, a metal complex, disrupts cell membrane integrity and inhibits enzyme function in fungi and bacteria.


## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for this combination product. Brand names may vary depending on the manufacturer and region. One identified brand name is Flucozest Z shampoo.


## **How It Works**

### Pharmacodynamics:

Fluconazole exerts its antifungal effect by inhibiting the fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme 14α-demethylase.  This enzyme is essential for the biosynthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes. By blocking ergosterol production, fluconazole disrupts membrane integrity and function, ultimately leading to fungal cell death.

Zinc pyrithione's mechanism of action involves disrupting cell membrane function in both fungi and bacteria, and inhibiting enzyme activity essential for their growth and survival.

### Pharmacokinetics:

*   **Fluconazole:** Orally administered fluconazole is well-absorbed, achieving peak plasma concentrations within 1 to 2 hours. It has high bioavailability, and food doesn't significantly affect absorption. Fluconazole distributes widely throughout the body, including the cerebrospinal fluid. It is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.

*   **Zinc pyrithione:** Topical zinc pyrithione has limited systemic absorption, resulting in minimal systemic effects.

### Elimination Pathways:

Fluconazole is primarily eliminated by renal excretion, with a small portion metabolized by the liver. Zinc pyrithione, applied topically, undergoes minimal systemic absorption, and most of it remains on the skin surface to be washed off.


## **Dosage**

As this is a combination product, the dosage may vary based on the specific formulation (e.g. shampoo) and manufacturer's recommendations. Always refer to the product insert or packaging for prescribed dosage and instructions.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### Adults:

The typical adult dosage of Fluconazole for systemic fungal infections ranges from 50 mg to 400 mg daily, depending on the infection type and severity.  Zinc pyrithione is typically used topically in concentrations of 1% to 2% for dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. When combined, the dosage and frequency will be specified in the product information. For Flucozest Z shampoo, once-daily use is typical for dandruff treatment.

#### Children:

Pediatric dosing should be determined by the child's weight and the specific condition being treated.  A physician should be consulted for appropriate dosing.


#### Special Cases:

*   **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be required in elderly patients with renal impairment.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage reduction is required for patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider potential drug interactions and adjust accordingly.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Since Fluconazole + Zinc pyrithione is primarily used for skin conditions, specific dosages for situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not applicable. Systemic fluconazole dosing, however, has guidelines within those contexts. Please consult the sources provided for that information.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments for systemic fluconazole are necessary in patients with renal and hepatic impairment and for patients with certain comorbid conditions.  Always consider potential drug interactions and monitor for adverse effects.



## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects**

*   Headache
*   Nausea
*   Abdominal pain
*   Diarrhea

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

*   Hepatotoxicity
*   Stevens-Johnson syndrome
*   Toxic epidermal necrolysis
*   QT interval prolongation
*   Serious allergic reactions

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term use of high-dose systemic fluconazole has been associated with liver damage and other serious side effects. With topical combination products like Flucozest Z, long-term effects are less common but may involve skin irritation or sensitization.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs may include severe skin reactions, liver dysfunction, and cardiac arrhythmias. Any such reactions necessitate immediate medical intervention.



## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to fluconazole, zinc pyrithione, or any component of the formulation.
*   Concomitant use with drugs known to prolong the QT interval and those metabolized by CYP3A4.

## **Drug Interactions**

Systemic Fluconazole has several clinically significant drug interactions, including:



*   **CYP450 interactions:** Fluconazole inhibits several CYP450 enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. This can lead to increased plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by these enzymes.
*   **Drugs that prolong the QT interval:** Co-administration with fluconazole can increase the risk of QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes.
*   **Other drugs:** Clinically significant interactions may occur with warfarin, sulfonylureas, phenytoin, cyclosporine, and other medications.



Topical zinc pyrithione has limited systemic absorption and is unlikely to cause significant drug interactions. However, always consult a medical professional for potential interactions with other medications the patient may be using, especially if they are also taking oral fluconazole.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

*   **Pregnancy:** Systemic fluconazole use should generally be avoided during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, due to potential teratogenic risks. Topical use of zinc pyrithione is generally considered safe during pregnancy.
*   **Breastfeeding:** Systemic fluconazole is excreted in breast milk and should be used with caution during breastfeeding. Topical zinc pyrithione poses minimal risk during breastfeeding.




## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** Fluconazole: Inhibits fungal ergosterol synthesis; Zinc pyrithione: Disrupts cell membrane integrity and inhibits enzyme function in fungi and bacteria.
*   **Side Effects:** Headache, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea; rare but serious: hepatotoxicity, severe skin reactions, QT prolongation.
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity; concomitant use with drugs known to prolong the QT interval and those metabolized by CYP3A4.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Numerous drug interactions, particularly with CYP3A4 substrates.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Systemic fluconazole should be avoided during pregnancy and used cautiously during breastfeeding. Topical zinc pyrithione is generally considered safe.
*   **Dosage:** Refer to product labeling for Fluconazole + Zinc pyrithione combination products. Systemic Fluconazole dosages vary based on the infection, patient specifics, and range from 50 mg to 800 mg daily.
*   **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests, electrolyte levels, ECG for QT interval prolongation (with systemic fluconazole).

## **Popular Combinations**

Fluconazole + Zinc pyrithione is a popular topical combination.  For systemic fungal infections, fluconazole may be combined with other antifungals like amphotericin B or flucytosine for synergistic effects in severe or resistant infections.

## **Precautions**

*   **General Precautions:** Monitor liver function, renal function, and electrolyte levels, particularly in patients with pre-existing conditions. Evaluate for drug interactions with concomitant medications.
*   **Specific Populations:** As provided in prior sections.
*   **Lifestyle Considerations:** Limiting alcohol consumption while on systemic fluconazole can help reduce the risk of hepatotoxicity.
