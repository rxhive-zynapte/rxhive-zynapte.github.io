## **Usage**

Fluocinolone acetonide + Povidone Iodine is prescribed for the treatment of skin infections, particularly those complicated by inflammation and itching, such as infected eczema or other dermatitis.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing a corticosteroid (Fluocinolone acetonide) and an antiseptic (Povidone Iodine).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Fluocinolone acetonide reduces inflammation and itching by blocking the production of prostaglandins, while Povidone iodine acts as an antiseptic by releasing iodine, which kills or inhibits the growth of a broad range of microorganisms.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for the combination product itself, though the individual components may be referred to by their chemical names. 

- **Brand Names:** Eczo-Wokadine, Eczo-Betadine.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Fluocinolone acetonide exerts its anti-inflammatory and antipruritic effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the skin. This leads to decreased production of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and cytokines. Povidone iodine releases free iodine, which disrupts microbial cell walls and inhibits protein synthesis, leading to microbial death.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Fluocinolone acetonide is minimally absorbed systemically when applied topically. Absorbed drug is metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted via the kidneys. Povidone iodine, when used topically on intact skin, has limited systemic absorption.  When applied to large open wounds or mucous membranes, iodine absorption can increase, leading to detectable serum iodine levels.  Iodine is primarily excreted by the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action/Receptor binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Fluocinolone acetonide binds to glucocorticoid receptors. Povidone iodine disrupts microbial cell walls and proteins via oxidation, although specific enzyme or receptor targets are not identified.
- **Elimination pathways:** Fluocinolone acetonide is metabolized in the liver and excreted renally. Iodine is primarily excreted renally.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer to the affected skin area 2-4 times daily, or as directed by a physician.

#### **Children:**  Use with caution in children.  Apply sparingly to limited areas of the body. Dosage will be determined by a physician based on the child's age and weight.


#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution and monitor for skin thinning.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution advised; consider potential for increased iodine absorption with open wounds.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution; consider potential for increased systemic absorption of Fluocinolone acetonide.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with thyroid disorders. Monitor thyroid function with prolonged or extensive use, particularly in patients with open wounds.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication is primarily intended for topical application on infected skin.  It is not indicated for use in situations such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or within the ICU setting. Its use in emergency situations is not indicated.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary based on patient-specific factors like the extent and severity of the infection and the patient's age and overall health status.   Close monitoring is recommended for prolonged or widespread application.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Itching
- Dryness
- Redness
- Burning sensation at the application site


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
- Skin atrophy with prolonged use, especially with occlusive dressings
- Thyroid dysfunction (hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism) with prolonged use on large open wounds
- Worsening of infection


### **Long-Term Effects**

- Skin thinning and striae (stretch marks)
- Telangiectasia (spider veins)
- Hypopigmentation (skin lightening)


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Angioedema
- Anaphylaxis (rare)


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to Fluocinolone acetonide, Povidone iodine, or any components of the formulation.
- Pre-existing thyroid disorders.
- Large open wounds (use with caution).
- Use in premature infants and neonates <1.5kg is contraindicated.



## **Drug Interactions**

- Lithium: May increase the risk of thyroid-related reactions.
- Mercury compounds: Risk of forming caustic compounds.
- Other topical antiseptics (e.g., chlorhexidine): Incompatibility or risk of skin reactions.
- Hormonal contraceptives: Povidone iodine can reduce effectiveness.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Fluocinolone acetonide is Pregnancy Category C. Use with caution during pregnancy only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the fetus.  Avoid using on large areas or for prolonged durations. Iodine can cross the placenta and affect fetal thyroid function.  
- **Breastfeeding:**  Fluocinolone acetonide and iodine can be excreted in breast milk. Use with caution during breastfeeding only if clearly needed.  Avoid applying to the nipple area.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Fluocinolone acetonide: Anti-inflammatory, antipruritic (binds to glucocorticoid receptors). Povidone Iodine: Antiseptic (releases free iodine, disrupting microbial function).
- **Side Effects:** Itching, dryness, redness, burning, irritation, rarely allergic reactions or thyroid dysfunction.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, thyroid disorders, large open wounds (with caution), premature infants and neonates <1.5kg.
- **Drug Interactions:** Lithium, mercury compounds, other topical antiseptics, hormonal contraceptives.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks. Avoid using on large areas or for prolonged durations.
- **Dosage:** Apply a thin layer 2-4 times daily.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor the affected skin area for irritation, allergic reactions, or signs of infection worsening. Monitor thyroid function with prolonged or extensive use, especially in patients with large open wounds.


## **Popular Combinations**

Fluocinolone acetonide + Povidone Iodine is itself a popular combination.  There are no commonly recommended additional drug combinations.

## **Precautions**
- **General Precautions:** Avoid contact with eyes, mucous membranes, and open wounds. Discontinue use if irritation or sensitization develops. Use with caution in patients with thyroid disorders. Do not use with occlusive dressings unless directed by a physician.
- **Specific Populations:** See Dosage - Special Cases.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** No specific lifestyle considerations.
