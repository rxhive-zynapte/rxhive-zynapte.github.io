## **Usage**

Fluorometholone + Neomycin ophthalmic suspension is prescribed for the treatment of steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions and superficial ocular bacterial infections susceptible to neomycin.  This includes inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea, and anterior segment of the globe.  It is also used prophylactically to prevent bacterial infections after ocular surgery or removal of foreign bodies.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Fluorometholone: Corticosteroid, anti-inflammatory agent
* Neomycin: Aminoglycoside antibiotic

**Mechanism of Action:**

Neomycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death.  Fluorometholone exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing the migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and reversing increased capillary permeability.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication is often referred to as Fluorometholone-Neomycin.

**Brand Names:**

FML-Neo, Flomex-N, and others (Note: Brand availability may vary regionally.)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* Neomycin: Bactericidal action against susceptible gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
* Fluorometholone: Suppresses the inflammatory response, reducing redness, edema, and pain.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* Topical ophthalmic administration limits systemic absorption.  
* Some penetration into the aqueous humor occurs.
* Hepatic metabolism is expected for fluorometholone, though information on specific pathways (CYP enzymes) in the context of ophthalmic use is limited.
* Neomycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine when administered systemically, however, with topical ophthalmic use, systemic absorption is minimal.

**Mode of Action:**

* Neomycin binds irreversibly to the 30S ribosomal subunit, inhibiting protein synthesis in bacteria.
* Fluorometholone binds to glucocorticoid receptors, modulating gene expression and ultimately suppressing the inflammatory cascade.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**

* Fluorometholone: Glucocorticoid receptor agonist.
* Neomycin:  Ribosomal protein synthesis inhibitor.

**Elimination Pathways:**

* Fluorometholone: Primarily hepatic metabolism.
* Neomycin: Minimal systemic absorption following topical ophthalmic administration; Renal excretion (when administered systemically).



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Instill 1 to 2 drops into the affected eye(s) two to four times daily. During the initial 24 to 48 hours, the frequency can be increased to 1 drop every hour, if needed.  

#### **Children:**

Safety and efficacy in children under 2 years of age have not been established.  For children over 2, the dosage is generally the same as for adults, but should be carefully determined and monitored by a physician.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Similar to adult dosing; monitor for increased intraocular pressure.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment not typically needed due to minimal systemic absorption.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment generally not needed due to minimal systemic absorption. However, caution is advised in severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Pre-existing glaucoma requires careful monitoring of intraocular pressure.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in these settings follows standard recommendations but requires careful physician oversight:

* **Intubation:** Not applicable for ophthalmic preparations.
* **Surgical Procedures:** Prophylactic use: 1-2 drops before and after the procedure.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not applicable for ophthalmic preparations.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** As per standard dosage, under close monitoring.
* **Emergency Situations:**  Not typically used in systemic emergencies.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are primarily based on clinical response and intraocular pressure monitoring, especially with prolonged use.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

* Ocular:  Mild stinging or burning, itching, foreign body sensation, blurred vision, tearing, dryness, increased sensitivity to light.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, cataract formation, corneal or scleral thinning, secondary ocular infections (fungal or viral), optic nerve damage.

### **Long-Term Effects**

* Cataracts, glaucoma, thinning of the cornea or sclera.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

* Hypersensitivity reactions (rare): Eyelid edema, rash, itching, difficulty breathing.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to fluorometholone, neomycin, or any component of the formulation.
* Active viral infections of the cornea and conjunctiva (e.g., herpes simplex, varicella).
* Mycobacterial infections of the eye (e.g., ocular tuberculosis).
* Fungal diseases of the eye.
* Untreated purulent ocular infections.
* Glaucoma (unless under very close monitoring).
* Pregnancy (unless clearly needed).
* Breastfeeding (not recommended).


## **Drug Interactions**

* Other ophthalmic medications: Allow sufficient time between applications (e.g., 15 minutes).
* Systemic corticosteroids: May increase the risk of systemic side effects.
* CYP3A inhibitors: Co-treatment may increase systemic exposure to fluorometholone.
* NSAIDs (topical ophthalmic): May delay wound healing when used concurrently.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* Pregnancy Category C (older classification system, more updated resources needed): Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.
* Breastfeeding: Excretion in breast milk unknown; not recommended due to the potential for serious adverse effects in infants.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Neomycin: Bacterial protein synthesis inhibition. Fluorometholone: Suppression of inflammatory response.
* **Side Effects:** Stinging, burning, itching, blurred vision; rarely, increased IOP, glaucoma, cataracts, secondary infections.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, viral/fungal/mycobacterial eye infections, glaucoma, pregnancy, breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** Systemic corticosteroids, CYP3A inhibitors, topical NSAIDs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Avoid unless clearly needed (pregnancy); Not recommended (breastfeeding).
* **Dosage:** 1-2 drops 2-4 times/day; initially, up to 1 drop/hour.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Intraocular pressure, visual acuity, lens clarity.

## **Popular Combinations**

Fluorometholone is sometimes combined with other antibiotics like tobramycin (e.g., Tobradex). This offers coverage against different bacterial strains.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Do not use for longer than prescribed (generally not beyond 10 days without close monitoring). Monitor intraocular pressure, especially with prolonged use.
* **Specific Populations:** As described above.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Blurred vision may temporarily impair driving or operating machinery.  Contact lenses should be removed before instillation and not reinserted for at least 15 minutes.
