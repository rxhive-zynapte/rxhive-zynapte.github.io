## **Usage**

Fluorometholone + Tobramycin is prescribed for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions with superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection.  It is also used for the treatment of anterior segment inflammation after cataract surgery.

It's pharmacological classifications are:

* **Fluorometholone:** Corticosteroid, anti-inflammatory agent
* **Tobramycin:** Aminoglycoside antibiotic

**Mechanism of Action:**

* **Fluorometholone:** Suppresses the inflammatory response by inhibiting multiple inflammatory cytokines. This reduces swelling, redness, and discomfort.
* **Tobramycin:** Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, leading to bacterial cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for this combination. Brand names may vary regionally. Some examples include:

* Tobradex
* Zylet

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Fluorometholone:** Exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the migration of neutrophils and reducing capillary permeability, thus diminishing edema and scarring.
* **Tobramycin:**  Bactericidal against susceptible gram-negative bacteria.  It may also have some activity against some gram-positive bacteria.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Fluorometholone:** After topical ophthalmic administration, there is minimal systemic absorption.
* **Tobramycin:**  Achieves therapeutic concentrations in the aqueous humor following topical application.  Systemic absorption is low after topical ophthalmic administration.

**Mode of Action:**

* **Fluorometholone:**  Binds to glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm, translocates to the nucleus, and modulates gene expression, reducing inflammatory mediators.
* **Tobramycin:** Interferes with the initiation complex of bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit.

**Elimination:**

* **Fluorometholone:** Primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine.
* **Tobramycin:** Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Instill 1 or 2 drops into the conjunctival sac of the affected eye(s) every 4 to 6 hours. During the initial 24 to 48 hours, the dosage may be increased to 1 or 2 drops every 2 hours, as directed by a physician.


#### **Children:**

In children 2 years of age and older, instill 1 or 2 drops into the conjunctival sac of the affected eye(s) every 4 to 6 hours. The dosage may be safely increased to 1 or 2 drops every 2 hours for the first 24-48 hours of treatment under the direction of a doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required. However, monitoring for adverse effects, especially increased intraocular pressure, is essential.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No specific dosage adjustments needed for topical application as systemic absorption is low.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments needed for topical application as systemic absorption is low.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with glaucoma, diabetes, or other systemic diseases as corticosteroids can exacerbate these conditions.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources focus on the usage of fluorometholone + tobramycin for ophthalmic inflammatory conditions and post-cataract surgery inflammation, they don't provide dosage recommendations for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are primarily based on the severity of inflammation and the patient's response to therapy. The initial higher frequency of administration can be tapered down as the condition improves.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

* Eye discomfort
* Transient blurred vision
* Increased intraocular pressure
* Eye itching or burning


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Cataract formation
* Glaucoma
* Secondary ocular infections
* Corneal thinning or perforation


### **Long-Term Effects**

Prolonged use of topical corticosteroids can lead to glaucoma, cataracts, and increased susceptibility to ocular infections.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions are rare but require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation
* Acute herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis)
* Vaccinia, varicella, and most other viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva
* Mycobacterial infection of the eye
* Fungal diseases of the eye


## **Drug Interactions**

No significant drug interactions are known for topical application of this combination.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Fluorometholone is Pregnancy Category C. Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:** It is unknown whether fluorometholone is excreted in human milk.  Exercise caution when administering to nursing mothers.  Tobramycin's effects on infants from topical administration to nursing mothers are also unknown.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Fluorometholone - Anti-inflammatory; Tobramycin - Antibiotic
* **Side Effects:** Eye discomfort, blurred vision, increased intraocular pressure, itching, burning.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, herpes simplex keratitis, viral/fungal/mycobacterial eye infections.
* **Drug Interactions:**  None significant for topical use.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category C; use with caution.
* **Dosage:** 1-2 drops every 4-6 hours, initially every 2 hours for 24-48 hours.
