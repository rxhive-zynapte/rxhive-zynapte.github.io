## **Usage**

Fluoxetine + Olanzapine is prescribed for the treatment of:

* **Treatment-resistant depression:**  Major depressive disorder in patients who have not responded adequately to two different antidepressant trials in the current episode.
* **Bipolar I disorder (depressive episodes):**  Acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. It is sometimes used after at least two other medications have been tried without success. It is not indicated for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This combination drug belongs to the following classes:

* **Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (fluoxetine):** Fluoxetine increases serotonin levels in the brain.
* **Atypical antipsychotic (olanzapine):** Olanzapine influences the activity of dopamine and serotonin in the brain.


**Mechanism of Action:** Fluoxetine + Olanzapine combines the distinct mechanisms of fluoxetine and olanzapine. Fluoxetine primarily inhibits serotonin reuptake, increasing serotonin availability in the synaptic cleft. Olanzapine acts as a serotonin 5-HT2A/2C and dopamine D1-4 receptor antagonist, along with other receptor interactions, which help to stabilize mood. The combination's synergistic action addresses depressive symptoms while potentially mitigating manic switching commonly associated with SSRIs in bipolar disorder.

## **Alternate Names**

* **Generic Name:** Fluoxetine and Olanzapine
* **Brand Name:** Symbyax

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Fluoxetine increases serotonin levels in the synaptic cleft, which contributes to improved mood. Olanzapine affects multiple neurotransmitter systems, including serotonin and dopamine. Its antagonism of certain receptors helps to stabilize mood and reduce the risk of mania.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Both fluoxetine and olanzapine are absorbed orally. The presence of food does not significantly affect the absorption of the individual components, but the effect on the combined formulation is not well studied.
* **Metabolism:** Fluoxetine is metabolized by the liver primarily via CYP2D6 to its active metabolite, norfluoxetine.  Olanzapine is metabolized by the liver primarily via CYP1A2 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2D6. Therefore, patients with hepatic impairment may require dose adjustment.
* **Elimination:** Fluoxetine and norfluoxetine have long half-lives. Fluoxetine is eliminated primarily through renal excretion, while olanzapine is mainly excreted in the feces. Dose adjustment should be considered in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction.

**Mode of Action:**

* **Fluoxetine:** Inhibits the reuptake of serotonin, making it more available in the synaptic cleft.
* **Olanzapine:** Antagonizes several serotonin and dopamine receptors, including 5-HT2A/2C and D1-4 receptors. This action contributes to its mood-stabilizing effects.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** As explained above.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for fluoxetine and fecal excretion for olanzapine.  Metabolism mainly through CYP2D6 (fluoxetine) and CYP1A2 (olanzapine).


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Initial dose:** 6 mg olanzapine/25 mg fluoxetine once daily in the evening.
* **Maximum dose:** 18 mg olanzapine/75 mg fluoxetine once daily.
* **Titration:** Dose adjustment can be made according to efficacy and tolerability.


#### **Children (10-17 years):**

* **Initial dose:** 3 mg olanzapine/25 mg fluoxetine once daily in the evening.
* **Maximum dose:** 12 mg olanzapine/50 mg fluoxetine once daily.
* **Titration:** Dose adjustment can be made according to efficacy and tolerability.

#### **Children (under 10 years):**

Not recommended. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose (e.g., 3 mg olanzapine/25 mg fluoxetine) and titrate cautiously due to potential age-related changes in metabolism and organ function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be required based on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Start with a lower dose and titrate cautiously. Monitor liver function.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is needed for patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or other relevant conditions due to the potential for drug interactions or exacerbation of pre-existing conditions.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication is not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary indications are treatment-resistant depression and bipolar I disorder (depressive episodes).


### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments are made based on individual patient response, tolerability, and factors like renal/hepatic function, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Drowsiness, tiredness, increased appetite, weight gain, dry mouth, swelling in the hands or feet, tremor, blurred vision, constipation, dizziness, and difficulty concentrating.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Serotonin syndrome (agitation, hallucinations, fever, sweating, shivering, fast heart rate, muscle stiffness, twitching, loss of coordination, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, autonomic instability), tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements, especially of the face and tongue), seizures, severe allergic reactions, and suicidal thoughts or behaviors.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Tardive dyskinesia, weight gain, metabolic changes (e.g., elevated cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood glucose), and potential impact on cardiovascular health.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any severe or unexpected reaction should be reported, and appropriate medical intervention should be taken.




## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to fluoxetine or olanzapine.
* Concomitant use of MAOIs or within 5 weeks of discontinuing MAOIs.
* Concomitant use of pimozide or thioridazine.
* Patients being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue.



## **Drug Interactions**

* **MAOIs:**  Risk of serotonin syndrome.
* **Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs):**  Increased risk of adverse effects.
* **Other serotonergic drugs (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans):**  Risk of serotonin syndrome.
* **Drugs that prolong the QT interval:**  Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
* **Drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 or CYP1A2:**  Potential for altered drug levels.
* **Alcohol:**  May increase sedation.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Category C:** Use only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  Neonatal effects may occur in infants exposed to SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics near term. These include respiratory distress, feeding difficulties, and temperature instability.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Both fluoxetine and olanzapine are present in breast milk. Potential risk to the infant should be weighed against the benefits of breastfeeding for both the mother and the baby.
