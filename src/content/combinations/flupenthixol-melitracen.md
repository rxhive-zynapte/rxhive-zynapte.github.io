## **Usage**

Flupenthixol + Melitracen is prescribed for various types of depression, including:

*   Psychogenic depression
*   Depressive neurosis
*   Masked depression
*   Psychosomatic affections accompanied by anxiety and apathy
*   Menopausal depression
*   Depression in alcoholics and drug addicts

It is also used in the maintenance treatment of psychogenic depressions and other psychoses and is helpful in managing anxiety disorders.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This combination drug falls under the category of atypical antipsychotics combined with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).

**Mechanism of Action:** Flupenthixol, the antipsychotic component, primarily acts as a dopamine receptor antagonist, blocking D1 and D2 receptors in the brain, particularly in the mesolimbic system. This action helps manage psychotic symptoms and stabilize mood.  Melitracen, the tricyclic antidepressant component, inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, thereby increasing their levels in the synaptic cleft and improving mood and alleviating depressive symptoms.

## **Alternate Names**

Flupenthixol + Melitracen is also known as Flupentixol + Melitracen. It is marketed under various brand names, including Deanxit and others, differing based on region and manufacturer.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Flupenthixol, by blocking dopamine receptors, particularly in the mesolimbic pathway, reduces psychotic symptoms like delusions and hallucinations. Its anxiolytic effect is attributed to its impact on dopamine and serotonin receptors. Melitracen, by inhibiting serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, increases their concentration in the synaptic cleft, thus improving mood, reducing anxiety, and promoting emotional well-being.

**Pharmacokinetics:** 

*   **Absorption:** Both components are well-absorbed orally. Maximum serum concentration is reached in about 4 hours after oral administration.
*   **Metabolism:** Flupenthixol undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism via sulphoxidation, side-chain N-dealkylation, and glucuronic acid conjugation. Melitracen is metabolized via demethylation and hydroxylation, forming an active metabolite called litracen.
*   **Elimination:** Flupenthixol is primarily eliminated in the faeces, with a small amount in urine. Its elimination half-life is around 35 hours. Melitracen is mainly eliminated via faeces and has an elimination half-life of about 19 hours.


**Mode of Action:** Flupenthixol binds to and blocks dopamine D1 and D2 receptors. Melitracen inhibits the presynaptic reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily hepatic for both drugs. Flupenthixol is mainly excreted in faeces as metabolites, while Melitracen is excreted via both faeces and urine.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard dose is one tablet twice daily (morning and noon). In severe cases, the morning dose may be increased to two tablets. The maximum daily dose is four tablets.

#### **Children:**

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Start with one tablet in the morning.  Increase to one tablet twice daily in severe cases.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be necessary, but specific guidelines are limited. Monitor renal function and adjust based on clinical response and tolerability.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dose adjustments may be necessary. Initiate with a lower dose and monitor liver function tests.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Carefully consider the potential for drug interactions with other medications the patient might be taking. Caution is advised in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or other relevant comorbidities.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage adjustments for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not specifically defined for this combination.  Dosage should be adjusted based on the individual patient's needs and clinical condition.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage modifications are required for elderly patients and those with hepatic or renal impairment.  Start with a lower dose and titrate according to clinical response and tolerability.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Dry mouth
*   Constipation
*   Dizziness
*   Tremor
*   Insomnia
