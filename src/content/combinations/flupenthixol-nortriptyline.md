## **Usage**

- Flupenthixol + Nortriptyline is prescribed for the treatment of schizophrenia and depression, particularly in cases where anxiety is a prominent feature.  It's also used in patients who have difficulty complying with oral medication regimens.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination drug falls under two classifications:
    * Flupenthixol: Thioxanthene antipsychotic
    * Nortriptyline: Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA)
- **Mechanism of Action:** Flupenthixol primarily acts as a dopamine antagonist, blocking dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the brain. This action helps manage the psychotic symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Nortriptyline, on the other hand, is a TCA that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, increasing their levels in the synaptic cleft.  This contributes to the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of the combination.

## **Alternate Names** 

While the generic name is Flupenthixol + Nortriptyline, several brand names exist depending on the region and manufacturer.  Some examples of brand names are:
* Fluxip N
* Cilapam FN
* Fpx N
* No Anxit
* Delexit-N
* Zoly


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Flupenthixol primarily affects dopaminergic pathways, exhibiting a high affinity for dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, and to a lesser extent, Î±1-adrenergic, 5-HT2, and histamine H1 receptors.  Nortriptyline primarily inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, increasing their availability in the synapses.  Both drugs exert their effects on the central nervous system, contributing to mood regulation.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Both drugs are absorbed orally. Flupenthixol is metabolized hepatically and has an elimination half-life of approximately 35 hours. Nortriptyline undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, primarily via CYP2D6, with a half-life ranging from 18 to 90 hours. Both are excreted in the urine and feces.

- **Mode of Action:**  Flupenthixol is a dopamine antagonist, while nortriptyline is a TCA inhibiting serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Flupenthixol blocks dopamine from binding to its receptors, reducing dopaminergic neurotransmission.  Nortriptyline enhances serotonergic and noradrenergic signaling by increasing the availability of serotonin and norepinephrine in the synapse.  Flupenthixol has a relatively high affinity for D1 and D2 receptors, as well as affinity for alpha-1 adrenergic, serotonin 5-HT2, and histamine H1 receptors. 

- **Elimination Pathways:** Both drugs are subject to hepatic metabolism. Flupenthixol undergoes hepatic metabolism and has an elimination half-life of around 35 hours. Nortriptyline is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 and has a variable half-life from 18 to 90 hours.  


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Starting dose: Usually 1 mg flupenthixol and 10 mg nortriptyline in the morning.
- Maintenance dose:  Can be increased up to 3 mg flupenthixol and a maximum of 150mg nortriptyline, distributed throughout the day. Titration should be gradual based on patient response.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for use in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses (0.5 mg flupenthixol and 10 mg nortriptyline) and titrate cautiously due to age-related changes in metabolism and increased sensitivity to side effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose reduction is necessary for both flupenthixol and nortriptyline. For flupenthixol, consider half the usual adult dose or less.  For nortriptyline, dosage adjustments are needed based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dose reduction is required for both medications due to impaired metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring and dose adjustments may be necessary, especially for patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, glaucoma, epilepsy, or seizure disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of Flupenthixol + Nortriptyline is not typically indicated for acute medical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its primary use is in the management of chronic conditions like schizophrenia and depression.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications should be made based on individual patient factors such as renal or hepatic impairment, age, other medical conditions, and concurrent medications.  Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) may be useful, especially for nortriptyline, to ensure optimal plasma levels and minimize side effects.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Dry mouth, constipation, weight gain, sleepiness, orthostatic hypotension, urinary retention, blurred vision, increased heart rate, muscle stiffness, restlessness, tremors, nausea, dizziness, headache, insomnia, and extrapyramidal symptoms.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), seizures, severe allergic reactions, cardiac arrhythmias, tardive dyskinesia, and prolonged QT interval.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Tardive dyskinesia, weight gain, metabolic disturbances, and sexual dysfunction.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

NMS, agranulocytosis, serotonin syndrome, and severe allergic reactions require immediate medical intervention.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to flupenthixol, nortriptyline, or any component of the formulation.
- Coma, circulatory collapse, subcortical brain damage, blood dyscrasias, Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, pheochromocytoma, prolactin-dependent tumors, Long QT syndrome.
- Recent myocardial infarction.
- Concurrent use of MAO inhibitors.

## **Drug Interactions**

- CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, opioids, barbiturates): Increased sedation and respiratory depression.
- Anticholinergics: Additive anticholinergic effects.
- QT prolonging agents (e.g., certain antiarrhythmics, some antibiotics): Increased risk of Torsades de Pointes.
- CYP2D6 inhibitors or inducers: Alter nortriptyline levels.
- Antihypertensives: Enhanced hypotensive effects.
- CNS stimulants (e.g., amphetamines): Decreased efficacy of Flupenthixol.
- Other antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs): Increased risk of serotonin syndrome.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Flupenthixol + Nortriptyline is generally avoided during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, due to the potential for adverse effects on the developing fetus.  Use only if the benefits outweigh the risks. Neonatal withdrawal symptoms may occur in newborns exposed to the drug in the third trimester.
- **Breastfeeding:** Flupenthixol and nortriptyline are excreted in breast milk.  Although limited data suggest low levels in breastfed infants with maternal use of up to 4 mg flupenthixol, it is generally recommended to use caution and monitor the infant for potential side effects.  Alternatives may be considered if necessary.
