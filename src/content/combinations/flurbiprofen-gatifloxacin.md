## **Usage**

Flurbiprofen + Gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution is prescribed for the treatment of bacterial eye infections, such as bacterial conjunctivitis (pink eye). It is also used prophylactically before certain ophthalmic surgical procedures, such as cataract surgery.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Flurbiprofen: Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID)
* Gatifloxacin: Fluoroquinolone antibiotic

**Mechanism of Action:**

Flurbiprofen inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and thus decreasing inflammation and pain. Gatifloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, essential enzymes for bacterial DNA replication and repair, leading to bacterial cell death.


## **Alternate Names**

Some alternate names include Flubigat, Flugati, Gatizex-F, and Noirgat-F.  Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer; examples include Bigflur G, Fiago FL, Flubgy, Flubigat, Flubip G, Flugati, Flurgat, Gatiaid-F, and Gaticel FL.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Flurbiprofen reduces ocular inflammation and pain by inhibiting COX enzymes and prostaglandin synthesis. Gatifloxacin exerts bactericidal action by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, disrupting bacterial DNA replication and repair.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Absorption of both drugs after topical ophthalmic administration is limited, minimizing systemic exposure.  Information regarding specific metabolic pathways and elimination for the combination ophthalmic product is limited in the provided sources. However, flurbiprofen is generally metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine, while gatifloxacin is also metabolized hepatically and excreted through renal and fecal pathways.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

For bacterial conjunctivitis, instill 1-2 drops into the affected eye(s) every 2 hours for the first two days, then 1-2 drops four times a day for the next five days.  For pre-operative prophylaxis, instill 1 drop every 30 minutes, beginning 2 hours before surgery (total of 4 drops). Post-operatively, instill 1 drop every 4 hours for 1-3 weeks.  Another source mentions 1-2 drops 2-4 times daily as a typical dosage.

#### **Children:**

Use in children under 1 year of age is not recommended. For children older than 1 year, the dosage should be determined by a physician. One source mentions a similar dosing regimen for children 1 year and older as for adults with bacterial conjunctivitis.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients**: Dosage adjustments are generally not necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Caution is advised, and dose adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Caution is advised, and dose adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Use with caution in patients with diabetes, nasal polyps, bleeding or clotting disorders, or other eye problems. Consult a physician.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Intubation**: Not applicable (ophthalmic use only).
* **Surgical Procedures**: Prophylactically before cataract and other eye surgeries (see Standard Dosage - Adults).
* **Mechanical Ventilation**: Not applicable (ophthalmic use only).
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**:  Specific dosing recommendations are not mentioned in the sources.
