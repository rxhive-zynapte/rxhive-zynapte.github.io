## **Usage**

Flurbiprofen + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose ophthalmic solution is primarily prescribed for ophthalmic procedures and conditions. It combines the anti-inflammatory action of flurbiprofen with the lubricating properties of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC).  It's used to:

* **Prevent miosis (pupil constriction):** During cataract surgery and other ophthalmic procedures.
* **Treat postoperative ocular inflammation:** Reducing pain and swelling after eye surgery.
* **Manage dry eye syndrome:** Providing lubrication and relieving dryness and irritation.


It's pharmacological classification is:

* **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)** (Flurbiprofen)
* **Lubricant** (Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose)

**Mechanism of Action:** Flurbiprofen inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin production, which mediates inflammation and pain. HPMC provides lubrication, mimicking natural tears.

## **Alternate Names**

While the combination itself doesn't have a distinct international nonproprietary name (INN), its components do:

* **Flurbiprofen:**  No widely used alternate names.
* **Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose:** Hypromellose, HPMC.

**Brand Names:** Flur, Ocufen, others (may vary by region)

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Flurbiprofen's anti-inflammatory action results from COX inhibition, primarily COX-1 and COX-2,  reducing prostaglandin synthesis. HPMC increases tear film stability, reducing evaporation and providing a soothing effect on the ocular surface.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Flurbiprofen:** After ophthalmic administration, systemic absorption is minimal. It's metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily via the kidneys.
* **HPMC:** Not absorbed systemically. Remains on the ocular surface.

**Mode of Action:**  Flurbiprofen binds to COX enzymes, preventing the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins.  HPMC physically interacts with the ocular surface, forming a viscous, lubricating layer.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Flurbiprofen acts through non-selective COX inhibition. HPMC doesn't have receptor binding or enzyme inhibition properties.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Flurbiprofen undergoes hepatic metabolism, with renal excretion of metabolites. HPMC is eliminated from the eye through blinking and tear drainage.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Cataract surgery:** 1 drop every 30 minutes, starting 2 hours before surgery.
* **Other indications:** 1 drop in affected eye(s) up to four times daily, or as prescribed.

#### **Children:**

Use in children under 12 years of age is generally not recommended, unless specifically prescribed by a physician. Pediatric dosing should be determined by the doctor based on the child's age and weight.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution. Start with a lower dose and adjust as needed based on tolerance and efficacy. Monitor renal function closely.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution, especially in advanced renal disease.  Dosage adjustments are needed.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dosage adjustments may be necessary in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration is required for patients with conditions like hypertension, heart failure, or a history of gastrointestinal bleeding.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing recommendations for specific clinical scenarios are provided above in the Standard Dosage and Special Cases section.  Dosage will be adjusted based on the indication and patient condition by the physician.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are detailed above in the Special Cases section.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Ocular burning or stinging
* Temporary blurred vision
* Eye redness or irritation
* Itching or watering of the eyes
* Sensitivity to light

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Corneal damage (with prolonged use)
* Allergic reactions (rare)
* Systemic side effects of flurbiprofen (rare with ophthalmic use)

### **Long-Term Effects**

* Potential for corneal complications with extended use

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, though rare, require urgent attention. Corneal ulceration or perforation may occur with chronic, inappropriate use.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to flurbiprofen, HPMC, or any component of the formulation.
* Active ocular infection.
* Third-trimester pregnancy.
* Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to aspirin or other NSAIDs.


## **Drug Interactions**

* Other ophthalmic medications (especially anti-inflammatory agents): Avoid concurrent use unless directed by an ophthalmologist.
* Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin): Concomitant use may increase bleeding risk.
* Systemic NSAIDs: Concurrent use is best avoided as it increases the risk of systemic effects.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Contraindicated in the third trimester. Use in the first and second trimesters only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk.
* **Breastfeeding:** Consult a physician before use. Flurbiprofen is excreted in breast milk in small amounts.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

The Drug Profile Summary is already provided above in individual sections detailing the mechanism of action, side effects, contraindications, drug interactions, pregnancy/breastfeeding considerations, and dosage.

## **Popular Combinations**

Flurbiprofen + HPMC is commonly used alone. Concomitant use with other eye drops during surgeries is possible but must be under strict ophthalmological supervision.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:**  Avoid contact lens wear during treatment. Do not touch the dropper tip to any surface to prevent contamination.
* **Specific Populations:** As described above in "Dosage" - "Special Cases".
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid driving or operating machinery if vision is blurred.
