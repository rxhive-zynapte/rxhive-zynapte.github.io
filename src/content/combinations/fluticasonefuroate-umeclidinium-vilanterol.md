## **Usage**

Fluticasone Furoate + Umeclidinium + Vilanterol is prescribed for the **maintenance treatment** of:

* **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)** in adults.  This includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It helps improve lung function, manage symptoms like breathlessness and cough, and reduce the frequency of exacerbations.
* **Asthma** in adults. It is used as a maintenance therapy to control asthma symptoms and prevent attacks when other asthma medications haven't been sufficient, or in severe cases requiring multiple medications.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This medication is a combination of three active ingredients, each belonging to a different drug class:

* **Fluticasone Furoate:** Inhaled Corticosteroid (ICS)
* **Umeclidinium:** Long-acting Muscarinic Antagonist (LAMA) or anticholinergic
* **Vilanterol:** Long-acting Beta2-adrenergic Agonist (LABA)

**Mechanism of Action:**

* **Fluticasone Furoate:** Reduces airway inflammation by suppressing the immune response and decreasing the production of inflammatory mediators.
* **Umeclidinium:** Relaxes the smooth muscles around the airways by blocking the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, leading to bronchodilation.
* **Vilanterol:** Relaxes airway smooth muscle by stimulating beta2-adrenergic receptors, resulting in bronchodilation and improved airflow.

## **Alternate Names**

* **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol
* **Brand Name:** Trelegy Ellipta, Elebrato Ellipta

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

The combined effect of the three components provides additive bronchodilation and anti-inflammatory action.  Fluticasone furoate reduces airway inflammation, while umeclidinium and vilanterol relax airway smooth muscle, leading to improved lung function and symptom relief in COPD and asthma patients.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** All three drugs are administered via inhalation and are systemically absorbed to varying degrees.
* **Metabolism:**
    * Fluticasone furoate and vilanterol are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 enzymes in the liver.
    * Umeclidinium is a substrate of CYP2D6.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through feces and to a lesser extent in urine.

**Mode of Action:**

* **Fluticasone Furoate:** Binds to glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm, modulating gene transcription and reducing the production of inflammatory mediators.
* **Umeclidinium:** Competitively binds to muscarinic M3 receptors on airway smooth muscle, preventing bronchoconstriction.
* **Vilanterol:**  Selectively stimulates beta2-adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle, activating intracellular pathways leading to smooth muscle relaxation.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**

* Fluticasone furoate: Glucocorticoid receptor agonist.
* Umeclidinium: Muscarinic M3 receptor antagonist.
* Vilanterol: Beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist.

**Elimination Pathways:**

* Primarily fecal excretion, with minor renal excretion.
* Hepatic metabolism by CYP3A4 (fluticasone furoate and vilanterol) and CYP2D6 (umeclidinium).


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **COPD:**  One inhalation of Trelegy Ellipta 100/62.5/25 mcg once daily.
* **Asthma:** One inhalation of Trelegy Ellipta 100/62.5/25 mcg or 200/62.5/25 mcg once daily, depending on disease severity and previous asthma therapy.

#### **Children:**

Use of Fluticasone Furoate + Umeclidinium + Vilanterol is *not* recommended in children under 18 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established in this population.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is generally required.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution in moderate to severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor patients with heart problems, high blood pressure, seizures, thyroid problems, diabetes, weak bones (osteoporosis), immune system problems, eye problems (glaucoma, cataracts), prostate or bladder problems.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Fluticasone Furoate + Umeclidinium + Vilanterol is *not* indicated for:

* **Intubation**
* **Surgical Procedures**
* **Mechanical Ventilation**
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
* **Emergency Situations** (e.g., acute bronchospasm)

A short-acting beta2-agonist (e.g., albuterol) should be used for acute bronchospasm or exacerbations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are generally not required for elderly patients or those with renal impairment. However, caution is advised in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Nasopharyngitis
* Headache
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Cold or flu symptoms (runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, cough)
* Nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, constipation, diarrhea
* Joint pain
* Hoarse voice
* Back pain
* Changes in taste

* Hypersensitivity reactions (angioedema, urticaria)
* Hyperglycemia
* Glaucoma, cataracts
* Cardiovascular effects (tachycardia, palpitations)
* Hypokalemia
* Immunosuppression
* Osteoporosis
* Adrenal suppression


### **Long-Term Effects:**

* Increased risk of osteoporosis with prolonged corticosteroid use.
* Increased risk of glaucoma and cataracts.
* Adrenal suppression.
* Growth suppression in children (although this medication is not recommended for children).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

* Angioedema
* Severe bronchospasm


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any of the components.
* Primary treatment of acute bronchospasm.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole):** Increase the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects.  Monitor closely or avoid co-administration.
* **Beta-blockers:** May antagonize the bronchodilating effects of vilanterol.
* **Other LABAs or LAMAs:** Avoid concomitant use as it may potentiate adverse reactions.
* **Diuretics (especially thiazide and loop diuretics):** May increase the risk of hypokalemia.
* **QTc prolonging drugs:**  Use with caution as vilanterol may also prolong the QTc interval.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Insufficient data in humans.  Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:** It is unknown if the components are excreted in human milk.  Consider the benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother's clinical need and potential risks to the infant.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Combination of ICS, LAMA, and LABA providing additive bronchodilation and anti-inflammatory effects.
* **Side Effects:** Nasopharyngitis, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, paradoxical bronchospasm, pneumonia, hypersensitivity reactions.
