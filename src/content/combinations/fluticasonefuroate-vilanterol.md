## **Usage**

Fluticasone furoate + vilanterol is prescribed for the **maintenance treatment** of asthma in patients aged 5 years and older, and for the **treatment and prevention of exacerbations** of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults.  It is **not** for the relief of acute bronchospasm or acute asthma attacks.

Its pharmacological classifications are:

* **Corticosteroid** (Fluticasone furoate)
* **Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA)** (Vilanterol)

**Mechanism of Action:** Fluticasone furoate reduces airway inflammation by binding to glucocorticoid receptors. Vilanterol relaxes airway smooth muscle by binding to beta2-adrenergic receptors, leading to bronchodilation.

## **Alternate Names**

Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol trifenatate.

**Brand Name:** Breo Ellipta, Relvar Ellipta.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Fluticasone furoate exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm of airway cells. This interaction leads to the modulation of gene transcription, inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators and reducing airway inflammation. Vilanterol binds to beta2-adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle, activating adenylate cyclase and increasing intracellular cyclic AMP levels. This process results in smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Both drugs are absorbed through the lungs after inhalation.
* **Metabolism:** Fluticasone furoate is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Vilanterol is also metabolized by CYP3A4, with minor contributions from CYP2D6.
* **Elimination:**  Primarily through feces.

**Mode of Action:**  Fluticasone furoate modulates gene expression to suppress inflammation. Vilanterol activates beta2-adrenergic receptors to relax bronchial smooth muscle.

**Receptor Binding:** Fluticasone furoate binds to glucocorticoid receptors. Vilanterol binds to beta2-adrenergic receptors.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism and fecal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Asthma:** Breo Ellipta 100/25 mcg or 200/25 mcg, one inhalation once daily.
* **COPD:** Breo Ellipta 100/25 mcg, one inhalation once daily.

#### **Children:**

* **Asthma (5-11 years):** Breo Ellipta 50/25 mcg, one inhalation once daily.
* **Asthma (12-17 years):** Breo Ellipta 100/25 mcg, one inhalation once daily.
* **COPD:** Not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is typically required.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advised. For moderate to severe hepatic impairment, the lower strength of Relvar Ellipta (92/22 mcg) is recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring may be necessary.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol is **not** indicated for:

* **Intubation**
* **Surgical Procedures**
* **Mechanical Ventilation**

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with hepatic impairment or those taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.


## **Side Effects**

Severe allergic reactions, paradoxical bronchospasm, cardiac arrhythmias.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to fluticasone furoate, vilanterol, or any of the excipients.  Primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of COPD or asthma where intensive measures are required.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** Can increase systemic exposure to fluticasone furoate.
* **Long-acting beta2-agonists:** Concurrent use is contraindicated.
* **Beta-blockers:** Can antagonize the bronchodilatory effects of vilanterol.
* **MAOIs and TCAs:** Can potentiate cardiovascular effects.
* **Diuretics:** Can potentiate hypokalemia.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.  Not assigned to a US FDA pregnancy category.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Caution is recommended. Limited data available.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Fluticasone furoate: anti-inflammatory (corticosteroid); Vilanterol: bronchodilator (LABA).
* **Side Effects:** Headache, upper respiratory tract infection, oral candidiasis, etc. Serious: worsening breathing, allergic reactions, cardiovascular effects.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, acute asthma or COPD exacerbations.
* **Drug Interactions:** Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, other LABAs, beta-blockers.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Limited data, use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
* **Dosage:** Asthma (Adults): 100/25 mcg or 200/25 mcg once daily; COPD (Adults): 100/25 mcg once daily. Pediatric dosing available.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Lung function, blood pressure, potassium levels, blood glucose, growth in children, eye examinations.


## **Popular Combinations**

Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol is itself a combination product.  It is not typically combined with other long-acting inhaled bronchodilators.


## **Precautions**

* Monitor for adverse effects, especially in patients with comorbidities.
* Regular monitoring of lung function, growth in children (if applicable), and eye exams may be necessary.
*  Avoid use in acute exacerbations.
