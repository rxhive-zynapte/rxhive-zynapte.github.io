## **Usage**

- This triple therapy is prescribed for the **maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)** in adults.  It is *not* indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm or for the treatment of asthma.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination drug includes a corticosteroid (fluticasone), a long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist (formoterol), and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (glycopyrrolate).  It can be classified as an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta-agonist/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (ICS/LABA/LAMA) combination.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Fluticasone reduces airway inflammation, formoterol relaxes and widens the airways, and glycopyrrolate further enhances bronchodilation by blocking muscarinic receptors, ultimately improving airflow and reducing COPD symptoms.

## **Alternate Names**

- While the generic name is Fluticasone Propionate + Formoterol + Glycopyrrolate, there may be regional variations.
- **Brand Names:** There are several brand names for this combination product and/or the related double combinations marketed in some parts of the world, depending on dosages and device.  Examples include *Trelegy Ellipta*, *Airz FF* and others (not an exclusive list).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Fluticasone, a corticosteroid, binds to glucocorticoid receptors in the lungs, reducing inflammation by suppressing the release of inflammatory mediators and inhibiting inflammatory cell activation. Formoterol, a LABA, stimulates β2-adrenergic receptors, leading to bronchodilation through relaxation of airway smooth muscle.  Glycopyrrolate, a LAMA, blocks muscarinic receptors, particularly M3 receptors in the airways, causing bronchodilation and also reducing mucus secretion.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  The combination is administered via inhalation. Fluticasone is systemically absorbed through the lungs, but due to extensive first-pass metabolism, oral bioavailability is low.  Formoterol is also absorbed from the lungs but has a longer duration of action than short-acting β2-agonists. Glycopyrrolate demonstrates low systemic absorption after inhalation and therefore negligible systemic anticholinergic effects.
- **Mode of Action:** At the molecular level, fluticasone modulates gene transcription, suppressing inflammatory pathways. Formoterol activates adenylate cyclase, increasing intracellular cyclic AMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation. Glycopyrrolate competitively inhibits acetylcholine binding to muscarinic receptors, preventing bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion.
- **Elimination:** Fluticasone is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 enzymes and excreted in the feces. Formoterol is mainly metabolized by direct glucuronidation and excreted primarily in the urine. Glycopyrrolate is also primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The standard dosage of Trelegy Ellipta is one inhalation (fluticasone propionate 100 mcg/formoterol fumarate dihydrate 6 mcg/glycopyrronium bromide 25 mcg) twice daily, administered as two inhalations in the morning and two inhalations in the evening.  Dosages of other brands/generics may vary; refer to each brand's information.

#### **Children:**

- This combination is *not* recommended for children below 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  No dosage adjustment is typically required in elderly patients.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is recommended, but specific dosage adjustments may not be required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, glaucoma, cataracts, osteoporosis, or thyroid disorders should be monitored closely, and dosage adjustments may be necessary.  Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction should also be monitored.


### **Clinical Use Cases**
