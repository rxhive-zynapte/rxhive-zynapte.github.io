## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used to address nutritional deficiencies, especially during pregnancy, and to support overall health. It is also used to improve cardiovascular functioning and for conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and to treat nutritional deficiencies, which may occur due to the body's inability to absorb nutrients properly. It's classified as a nutritional supplement.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no specific alternate names established for this combined formulation. However, individual components are known by other names like: vitamin B9 (folic acid), vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin). Several brand names exist for this combination, including Argin-Max Sachet Orange Sugar Free and Argivio Sachet Cranberry Sugar Free.

## **How It Works**

This combination product's mechanism of action involves the synergistic contribution of each component:

* **Folic Acid:** Acts as a coenzyme in crucial metabolic processes, particularly DNA and RNA synthesis and cell division and growth, playing a vital role in preventing neural tube defects during fetal development. Also contributes to the formation of healthy red blood cells and helps to produce and maintain new cells.

* **L-Arginine:**  A precursor to nitric oxide, a vasodilator that improves blood flow. This vasodilating action plays a vital role in treating heart diseases. This contributes to better placental circulation during pregnancy and improves blood flow by widening blood vessels, which can be beneficial for conditions like pre-eclampsia and cardiovascular health in general. It also aids in treating erectile dysfunction.

* **Methylcobalamin:** This form of Vitamin B12 is essential for nerve function, DNA synthesis and red blood cell formation. It supports nerve cell regeneration and improves mood regulation and sleep. Plays an important role in every cell's metabolism, specifically in fatty acid and amino acid metabolism.

* **Zinc Sulphate Monohydrate:** Supports immune function, cell growth, and protein synthesis. Plays a crucial role in fetal development and may reduce the risk of preterm birth. Helps in the development of the baby's cells and DNA.


This medicine is absorbed orally. Specific information on its metabolism and elimination pathways requires further research.


## **Dosage**

Dosage varies considerably depending on individual patient needs, the specific formulation, and manufacturer's guidelines. A healthcare professional should determine the appropriate dosage.


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

A physician should be consulted for determining adult dosages. Typically, one sachet or tablet daily is recommended for adults.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustment might be necessary based on kidney function and overall health.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Careful consideration and potential dose adjustments are advisable due to altered drug clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, as liver disease may impact drug metabolism.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dose modifications may be necessary, especially for diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage for clinical situations like intubation, mechanical ventilation, surgical procedures, ICU use, or emergencies should be determined by the attending physician.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms can influence drug metabolism and may warrant dose adjustments. Consulting a physician or pharmacist is crucial.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs requiring urgent intervention are not well-documented. Report severe reactions to a healthcare professional.


## **Contraindications**

Contraindicated in individuals with hypersensitivity to any component. Other contraindications depend on individual constituents, including severe liver or kidney disease, certain metabolic disorders, and untreated vitamin B12 deficiency anemia.


## **Drug Interactions**

Potential interactions include:

* Folate antagonists (methotrexate)
* Anticonvulsants (phenytoin, phenobarbital, valproic acid)
* Proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers (omeprazole, ranitidine, esomeprazole)
