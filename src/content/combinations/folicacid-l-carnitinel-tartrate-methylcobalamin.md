## **Usage**

This combination is primarily prescribed for the treatment and prevention of nutritional deficiencies, particularly those involving folic acid (vitamin B9) and vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin). It is also used to address specific conditions related to these deficiencies, such as megaloblastic anemia (a type of anemia caused by impaired DNA synthesis), peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage), and hyperhomocysteinemia (high levels of homocysteine in the blood).  L-Carnitine L-Tartrate supports energy production by aiding in fatty acid transport and may be beneficial for fatigue and certain metabolic conditions.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Nutritional Supplement.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Folic acid is essential for DNA synthesis, red blood cell formation, and cell division. Methylcobalamin is crucial for nerve function, myelin sheath formation, and red blood cell production.  L-Carnitine L-Tartrate facilitates the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they are oxidized to produce energy.

## **Alternate Names**

While there is no standard international nonproprietary name (INN) for this combination product, variations may refer to the individual components (e.g., "folic acid/methylcobalamin/levocarnitine").

- **Brand Names:**  Various brand names exist, often including combinations like "LCARNITIME PLUS", "Nanocob-LC", "Folmicob-LC", "Cobanerve-LC", "AudiTAB LC", "SARFAST-LC", "Trinerve-LC", "Nurokind LC", and "MYSCOM LC."

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Folic acid is converted to its active form, tetrahydrofolic acid, which is involved in DNA synthesis, cell division, and homocysteine metabolism. Methylcobalamin acts as a cofactor for methionine synthase, crucial for DNA and red blood cell production and homocysteine metabolism. L-carnitine transports fatty acids into mitochondria for beta-oxidation, contributing to energy production.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Folic acid is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. L-Carnitine is absorbed via active transport. Methylcobalamin is absorbed in the ileum and requires intrinsic factor.
    - **Metabolism:** Folic acid is metabolized in the liver. L-Carnitine and Methylcobalamin undergo limited metabolism.
    - **Elimination:**  Folic acid metabolites are primarily excreted renally.  L-Carnitine and its metabolites are mainly excreted in urine. Methylcobalamin is primarily eliminated via biliary excretion, with some renal excretion.

- **Mode of Action:**  See Pharmacodynamics.

- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Folic acid and Methylcobalamin function as cofactors for various enzymes.

- **Elimination Pathways:** See Pharmacokinetics.

## **Dosage**

Dosage is determined by the specific condition and the individual patient's needs. A healthcare professional should be consulted for the appropriate dosage.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One tablet per day is a common recommendation, although this may vary.  The formulation and strength (e.g., 500 mg L-Carnitine L-Tartrate, 1500 mcg Methylcobalamin, 1.5 mg Folic Acid) influence the prescribed dose.

#### **Children:**

Pediatric dosage should be determined by a pediatrician, considering factors like age and weight.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary due to age-related changes in renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised, as L-carnitine metabolites can accumulate. Dosage adjustments are often required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, and dosage adjustments may be required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage should be individualized considering potential drug interactions and the patient's specific condition.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage for specific clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not standardized for this combination and must be determined by the attending physician on a case-by-case basis.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be necessary based on patient-specific factors such as renal or hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms.
