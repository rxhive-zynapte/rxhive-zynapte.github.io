      considered safe during breastfeeding, although maternal intake of
      Levo-carnitine can lead to its presence in breast milk, which may affect
      the infant.

## **Usage**

Folic acid + Levo-carnitine is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to address deficiencies in folic acid and levo-carnitine. It is prescribed for conditions like megaloblastic anemia (caused by folic acid deficiency),  and primary and secondary carnitine deficiency.  It is also used in the management of chronic diseases where supplementation with these nutrients is beneficial. It's classified as a vitamin and micronutrient supplement.

Levo-carnitine facilitates the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they are oxidized to produce energy. Folic acid is essential for DNA synthesis, cell division, and red blood cell production. It's converted to its active form, tetrahydrofolic acid, which plays a key role in various metabolic processes.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Folic Acid + Levo-carnitine" is a clear descriptive name, there are no widely recognized alternate generic names.  Brand names may vary depending on the manufacturer and region. For example, one brand name is "Trinerve-LC" (which also includes Mecobalamin).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Levo-carnitine improves energy production by enhancing fatty acid transport into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation. Folic acid aids in DNA synthesis, red blood cell formation, and homocysteine metabolism.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Folic acid is readily absorbed in the small intestine. Levo-carnitine is absorbed through active transport in the small intestine. Both are metabolized in the liver and primarily excreted by the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** Levo-carnitine acts as a carrier molecule, transporting long-chain fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane. Folic acid, after conversion to tetrahydrofolic acid, acts as a cofactor for several enzymes involved in DNA and amino acid synthesis.

**Elimination:** Levo-carnitine and its metabolites are primarily eliminated via renal excretion. Folic acid is excreted in the urine, both as unchanged drug and metabolites.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  One tablet daily or as directed by a physician. Tablets generally contain 500mg L-carnitine and 1.5mg folic acid.

#### **Children:** Pediatric dosing should be based on the child's weight and the specific condition being treated.  For carnitine deficiency, an initial dose of 50 mg/kg/day orally, divided into even doses, is recommended, with a maintenance dose of 50 to 100 mg/kg/day orally, in divided doses.  The maximum dose is 3 grams per day. For intravenous administration, 50 mg/kg as a slow 2 to 3 minute bolus or by infusion, once a day is recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary depending on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is needed for patients with impaired renal function to prevent the accumulation of potentially toxic metabolites.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advised, and dose adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage should be individualized based on the patient's specific conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosages for these settings should be determined in consultation with a specialist and based on individual patient needs. The use of this combination in these contexts is not standardized and may be supplemental to other therapies.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments should be considered based on renal function, hepatic function, and other comorbid conditions.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

* Nausea
* Bloating
* Allergic reactions (skin rash, itching)
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Fishy body odor (specifically with Levo-carnitine)


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
* Seizures (with high doses of Levo-carnitine in patients with pre-existing seizure disorders)



### **Long-Term Effects**
Long-term side effects are generally minimal when taken as directed.  High doses of Levo-carnitine for extended periods can potentially lead to gastrointestinal issues.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Serious adverse drug reactions are rare. Any signs of an allergic reaction should be addressed immediately.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any component of the product.

## **Drug Interactions**


* Valproic acid: Levo-carnitine might reduce valproic acid levels, potentially decreasing its efficacy.
* Warfarin:  Theoretically, Levo-carnitine might increase the risk of bleeding in patients taking warfarin, although this is not definitively established.
* Thyroid hormones:  High doses of Levo-carnitine might interfere with thyroid hormone function.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Folic acid supplementation is generally recommended during pregnancy to prevent neural tube defects. Levo-carnitine should be used with caution during pregnancy and only if clearly needed, as its effects on fetal development are not fully understood. It is generally considered safe to take Levo-carnitine while breastfeeding. Folic acid is also considered safe during breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Levo-carnitine: Transports fatty acids into the mitochondria for energy production; Folic Acid: Essential for DNA synthesis and red blood cell formation.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, bloating, allergic reactions, vomiting, diarrhea, fishy body odor.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to any component.
* **Drug Interactions:** Valproic acid, warfarin, thyroid hormones.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Folic acid: recommended; Levo-carnitine: use with caution if clearly needed.
* **Dosage:**  Adults: one tablet daily; Children: consult a healthcare professional.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  For carnitine deficiency, monitor carnitine levels; for anemia, monitor hemoglobin and hematocrit.

## **Popular Combinations**

Folic acid is often combined with other B vitamins, especially in prenatal vitamins. Levo-carnitine may be combined with other vitamins and minerals targeted at improving energy levels or metabolic function.  A common combination is L-carnitine, Mecobalamin and Folic Acid.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Evaluate renal and hepatic function before initiating therapy, especially for high doses or prolonged use. Assess for any history of allergies to the components.
* **Specific Populations:** Use cautiously in pregnant or breastfeeding women and patients with renal impairment.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** No specific lifestyle considerations are usually necessary.
