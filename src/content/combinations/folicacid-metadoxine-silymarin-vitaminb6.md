## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for supporting liver health and function. It's used to treat conditions like:

* Alcoholic liver disease
* Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
* Liver inflammation
* Chronic viral hepatitis B and C
* Cirrhosis
* Liver fibrosis
* General liver dysfunction

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This combination falls under several classifications:

* Hepatoprotective
* Antioxidant
* Vitamin Supplement

**Mechanism of Action:**

This combination works through the synergistic action of its components:

* **Metadoxine:**  Accelerates alcohol breakdown, reduces liver fat accumulation, and protects against alcohol-induced damage.
* **Silymarin:**  Acts as an antioxidant, scavenging free radicals, promoting liver cell regeneration, and stabilizing liver cell membranes.
* **L-Ornithine L-Aspartate:** (often included, although not mentioned in title)  Reduces ammonia levels in the blood, thereby decreasing hepatic encephalopathy risk.
* **Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine):** Supports enzyme activity crucial for protein metabolism in the liver and prevents vitamin B6 deficiency often associated with liver disease.
* **Folic Acid:** Supports cell growth and repair essential for overall liver function and prevents folic acid deficiency which can be worsened by liver conditions.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no single official alternate name for this specific combination. The components are often seen listed in differing order. It's sometimes referred to generally as a "liver support formula" or "hepatoprotective combination."  Some sources list Taurine as a potential component. Some brand names this combination may be sold under include:
- Livorus
- Reheptin
- Liviz
- Hepagold


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

The combined effect of the ingredients results in improved liver function, reduced oxidative stress, and decreased ammonia levels.

* **Metadoxine:** Increases the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, speeding up alcohol metabolism. 
* **Silymarin:** Prevents lipid peroxidation, stabilizes liver cell membranes, and promotes protein synthesis, facilitating liver regeneration.
* **L-Ornithine L-Aspartate:** Participates in the urea cycle, converting ammonia to urea, thus lowering ammonia levels.
* **Vitamin B6:** Acts as a cofactor for various enzymes involved in liver metabolism.
* **Folic Acid:**  Essential for DNA synthesis and cell division, contributing to liver regeneration and repair.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* Absorption: Orally administered components are absorbed through the digestive system.
* Metabolism: Primarily metabolized in the liver.
* Elimination: Excreted through urine and bile.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**
