      How does folic acid mitigate methotrexate side effects?**


      **A:** Folic acid provides the body with folate, bypassing the block
      caused by methotrexate, thus reducing side effects associated with folate
      deficiency.

      Can folic acid be taken on the same day as methotrexate?**


      **A:** Generally, it's recommended to take folic acid on a different day
      to avoid potential interference with GI absorption, although this is
      debated, with some guidelines allowing daily folic acid dosing and
      beginning the day after the methotrexate dose.

## **Usage**

Folic acid is prescribed alongside methotrexate to mitigate methotrexate's adverse effects, particularly in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. Methotrexate, an antimetabolite and antifolate drug, is used to treat certain cancers, autoimmune conditions (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, lupus), and ectopic pregnancies.  Folic acid supplementation does not interfere with methotrexate's efficacy in treating these conditions. However, in the case of cancer treatment, folic acid may reduce the efficacy of methotrexate, so it's generally avoided unless specifically prescribed by an oncologist.

## **Alternate Names**

* **Folic Acid:** Folate, Vitamin B9
* **Methotrexate:**  amethopterin, MTX
* **Brand names:**  Rheumatrex, Trexall, Otrexup, Rasuvo


## **How It Works**

**Methotrexate** is a folate antimetabolite that inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), thereby disrupting DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. This inhibition primarily affects rapidly dividing cells, such as those involved in immune responses and cancer growth. Its anti-inflammatory effects are partly mediated by increased adenosine release.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Methotrexate is absorbed variably following oral administration. It undergoes hepatic metabolism and is primarily excreted renally. High doses can exhibit nonlinear pharmacokinetics due to saturable renal clearance. Dose adjustments may be necessary in renal impairment.

**Folic acid** supplementation counteracts the adverse effects of methotrexate by providing the body with the folate it needs to carry out essential cellular processes unaffected by methotrexate. This reduces the risk of side effects related to folate deficiency. It does not affect the therapeutic effect of methotrexate when used to treat autoimmune conditions, due to different mechanisms.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Methotrexate:** 7.5-25 mg orally or subcutaneously ONCE weekly for rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune conditions. For cancers, the dosage and schedule vary based on the specific type and stage of cancer.
* **Folic Acid:**  5-10mg orally ONCE weekly, taken on a different day than methotrexate, often 2-3 days after the methotrexate dose.  Daily doses may be used, usually at a lower dosage (e.g. 1mg daily), starting the day after the weekly methotrexate dose.

#### **Children:**

Methotrexate dosing in children is weight-based and should be determined by a specialist.  Folic acid supplementation is also recommended.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients & Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment:** Lower starting doses and slower titration are advised. Dose adjustments are crucial in renal impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized dosing is necessary considering the specific comorbidity.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Methotrexate and folic acid combination is primarily prescribed chronically for autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Their use in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations is not routine. Methotrexate is however sometimes used in high doses for cancer treatment, which would also require close monitoring and might necessitate a dose adjustment for folic acid.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are required for renal and hepatic impairment, and potentially for other comorbid conditions. Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism should be considered.
