## **Usage**

- This combination is prescribed for the treatment and prevention of nutritional deficiencies, particularly deficiencies in folic acid, vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin), vitamin B3 (nicotinamide), and vitamin C. It is also used in the management of megaloblastic anemia.  It supports healthy cell growth and function, aids in the proper functioning of the brain and nervous system, and prevents neural tube defects during pregnancy.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Vitamin Supplement, Hematinic.


- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination works by replenishing depleted levels of these essential vitamins. Folic acid is crucial for DNA synthesis, cell division, and red blood cell formation. Methylcobalamin is vital for nerve function, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell production. Nicotinamide is essential for energy production, DNA repair, and cell signaling. Vitamin C acts as an antioxidant, strengthens immunity, and aids in collagen formation.


## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination. Each component has its own synonyms (e.g., vitamin B9 for folic acid, vitamin B12 for methylcobalamin, niacinamide for nicotinamide, ascorbic acid for vitamin C), but the combination is typically referred to by its constituent components.

- **Brand Names:** Cobnow Forte, Nerver-C, and several others (brand names may vary regionally).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Folic acid is converted to tetrahydrofolic acid, a coenzyme crucial for DNA, RNA, and amino acid synthesis. Methylcobalamin is a coenzyme for methionine synthase, facilitating homocysteine metabolism and DNA synthesis. Nicotinamide, converted to NAD, is crucial for cellular metabolism and energy production. Vitamin C neutralizes free radicals, promotes collagen synthesis, and enhances iron absorption.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** All components are readily absorbed orally. Folic acid is metabolized in the liver. Methylcobalamin is stored in the liver. Nicotinamide is converted to NAD and its metabolites are excreted in urine. Vitamin C is distributed widely in the body, with excess excreted in urine.


- **Mode of Action/Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Folic acid doesn't bind to specific receptors but acts as a coenzyme. Methylcobalamin participates in enzymatic reactions. Nicotinamide influences enzyme activity via NAD. Vitamin C enhances enzyme function and acts as a reducing agent.

- **Elimination pathways:** Folic acid metabolites are excreted primarily renally. Methylcobalamin is primarily eliminated via biliary excretion. Nicotinamide metabolites are excreted renally. Vitamin C and its metabolites are primarily excreted renally.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Dosage varies depending on the specific deficiency and formulation. Common dosages for individual components: Folic acid (400 mcg-5 mg), Methylcobalamin (500 mcg - 2500 mcg), Nicotinamide (10-500 mg), Vitamin C (150 - 2000 mg).  A combination injection can contain for example 150 mg of Vitamin C, 2500 mcg of Methylcobalamin, 0.7 mg of Folic Acid, and 12 mg of Niacinamide.

#### **Children:** Dosage should be determined by a pediatrician based on age, weight, and specific deficiency.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be required based on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose modification, especially for methylcobalamin and nicotinamide, is based on the degree of impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, especially with high-dose nicotinamide.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Dosage adjustments might be needed in cases of diabetes, gout, etc. Consult product-specific guidelines.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is not typically used in acute medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU/emergency situations. It is intended for managing nutritional deficiencies.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any component, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, severe liver disease.  Pernicious anemia and other conditions that prevent Vitamin B12 absorption.


## **Drug Interactions**


Folic acid can interact with methotrexate and certain anticonvulsants. Nicotinamide can interact with medications metabolized by the liver. Alcohol can reduce folic acid absorption.  May interact with blood thinners, antibiotics, gout medication, anti-diabetics, anti-ulcer drugs, and chemotherapy medications.
