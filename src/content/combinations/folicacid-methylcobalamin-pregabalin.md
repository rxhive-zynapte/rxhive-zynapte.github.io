## **Usage**

- This combination is primarily prescribed for the management of neuropathic pain, a type of chronic pain caused by nerve damage or dysfunction. Specific neuropathic conditions this combination may be used for include diabetic neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, and sciatica.  It is also used as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial onset seizures.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Analgesic, Anticonvulsant, Vitamin Supplement (B Vitamins).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Pregabalin acts as an anticonvulsant by modulating calcium channels on nerve cells, reducing the release of neurotransmitters that transmit pain signals. Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B12) and Folic acid are essential for nerve health, supporting myelin sheath production (the protective layer around nerve fibers) and nerve cell regeneration.  This combined action helps alleviate nerve pain and improve nerve function.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names for this specific combination exist. However, individual components have various names (e.g., Vitamin B12 for Methylcobalamin).
- **Brand Names:** Several brand names market this combination, including Neurocare, Pregmax M-75, Pegabanyl Plus, Gabafix-M. Regional brand names may vary.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Pregabalin binds to the alpha-2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system, reducing calcium influx and subsequently decreasing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, including glutamate, noradrenaline, and substance P. This leads to a decrease in neuronal excitability and pain signal transmission. Methylcobalamin is a cofactor for methionine synthase, crucial for myelin synthesis and nerve cell repair.  Folic acid is crucial in DNA synthesis and plays a role in the formation of neurotransmitters, further supporting nerve function.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Pregabalin is rapidly absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1.5 hours. Food may slightly decrease absorption rate, but the bioavailability remains high.  Methylcobalamin is absorbed in the terminal ileum and requires intrinsic factor. Folic Acid is absorbed in the jejunum. Pregabalin is primarily eliminated renally, while methylcobalamin undergoes enterohepatic circulation and hepatic metabolism, with some renal excretion. Folate is also eliminated renally.
- **Mode of Action:** Pregabalin's action is primarily on reducing neuronal excitability, while Methylcobalamin and Folic acid work by supporting nerve regeneration and maintaining their overall health.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Pregabalin binds to the alpha-2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels. Methylcobalamin is a cofactor for methionine synthase. Folic acid is involved in the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, necessary for DNA and RNA synthesis. It also is required in many other reactions and helps in the production of some neurotransmitters.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Pregabalin is predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine. Methylcobalamin undergoes enterohepatic circulation and some hepatic metabolism. Folate is primarily excreted in the urine.

## **Dosage**

Dosage information for this specific combination is limited. Dosage recommendations are based on individual components and clinical practice. Consult the prescribing information for brand-name products or medical references for detailed dosage guidance.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Pregabalin is usually started at 150mg/day, given in divided doses. The dose can be increased up to 600mg/day as needed, based on the individual's response and tolerability. Methylcobalamin doses typically range from 750mcg to 1500mcg daily. Folic acid supplementation is typically 1.5mg to 5mg daily.

#### **Children:**

The safety and efficacy of this combination in children have not been established.  Use with caution and only under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be required due to age-related changes in kidney function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments of pregabalin are necessary based on creatinine clearance. For patients on hemodialysis, supplementary dosing may be required after dialysis sessions.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advised, though specific dosage modifications for methylcobalamin or folic acid are not typically required. Close monitoring is essential.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider individual patient factors like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc., when determining dosage and monitoring.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific medical settings, such as those listed, are not available for this fixed combination. Dosage should be based on individual components and adjusted according to the patient's specific needs.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments should be made based on patient-specific factors, including renal/hepatic dysfunction, and in consultation with the latest medical guidelines.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Pregabalin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus. 
- **Breastfeeding:** It is unknown if pregabalin, methylcobalamin, or folic acid pass into breast milk. Use caution and consult a physician.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

Refer to sections above for a summary of the Mechanism of Action, Side Effects, Contraindications, Drug Interactions, Pregnancy & Breastfeeding, and Dosage.

- **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for adverse events, efficacy, and potential drug interactions. Renal function should be assessed in patients with renal impairment.  Periodic blood tests may be considered to assess vitamin B12 and folate levels.
