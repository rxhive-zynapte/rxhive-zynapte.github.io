## **Usage**

Folic acid combined with sodium feredetate is primarily prescribed for the treatment and prevention of iron-deficiency anemia, particularly during pregnancy and lactation.  It is also used to address nutritional deficiencies related to iron and folate. This combination medication is classified as a hematinic and nutritional supplement.

The mechanism of action involves providing a readily available source of iron (sodium feredetate) for hemoglobin synthesis and replenishing folate stores, which are essential for red blood cell formation and DNA synthesis. 

## **Alternate Names**

While "Folic acid + Sodium Feredetate" is the common generic name, some formulations may also include vitamin B12. Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and specific formulation. Some examples include Feretate, Lycofer, and Hemoforce Forte.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Sodium feredetate, a stable iron complex, is absorbed in the duodenum and jejunum.  It delivers iron for incorporation into hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells. Folic acid is converted to its active form, tetrahydrofolic acid, which is crucial for DNA synthesis, cell division, and red blood cell maturation.  Vitamin B12, if present in the formulation, works synergistically with folic acid in these processes.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Sodium feredetate is absorbed more readily than other iron salts and has less gastrointestinal irritation. Absorption is enhanced when taken between meals and with vitamin C.  It's important to avoid co-administration with antacids, milk, tea, or coffee, which can hinder iron absorption. Folic acid is absorbed primarily in the jejunum. Both iron and folic acid are metabolized in the liver. Iron is stored as ferritin and hemosiderin, while excess folic acid is excreted in the urine.  Iron excretion is minimal.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  One tablet or capsule containing the prescribed amounts of folic acid and sodium feredetate once daily, or as directed by the physician. For liquid formulations, the dosage varies depending on the concentration but commonly ranges from 5ml to 15ml one to three times daily.

#### **Children:** Dosage is determined by the child's age and weight, with liquid formulations generally preferred. Common starting doses range from 2.5ml once or twice daily for infants to 5ml twice daily for children aged 6-12 years. 

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage should be initiated cautiously, usually starting at the lower end of the adult range and adjusted according to renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are required based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution and monitor liver function tests.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider the impact of comorbidities like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and peptic ulcer disease when determining the appropriate dosage and monitoring.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of Folic Acid + Sodium Feredetate in specific medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or emergency situations should be guided by individual patient requirements and is not routinely part of standardized protocols for these scenarios. Iron and folate supplementation might be considered part of overall nutritional support based on patient needs.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments should be based on the patient's response to therapy, hemoglobin levels, and iron status.  For patients with renal or hepatic impairment, appropriate modifications are necessary.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Constipation, diarrhea, nausea, dark stools (harmless), and stomach upset are the common side effects.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, difficulty breathing), iron overload (in individuals with hemochromatosis), gastrointestinal bleeding.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term high doses of iron can lead to iron overload.  Masking of vitamin B12 deficiency might occur with high doses of folic acid.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, iron toxicity.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any component of the drug, iron overload disorders (hemochromatosis, hemosiderosis), anemias not caused by iron deficiency.

## **Drug Interactions**

Antacids, antibiotics (tetracyclines, chloramphenicol), anticonvulsants (phenytoin), levodopa, quinolone antibiotics, thyroid medications, bisphosphonates, dairy products, eggs, tea, and coffee can decrease iron absorption. Alcohol can interact with sodium feredetate.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

This combination is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding when used as directed. However, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for proper dosage and monitoring.
