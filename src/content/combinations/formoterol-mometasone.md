      Can Formoterol + Mometasone be used to treat an acute asthma attack?**


      **A:** No, it is not a rescue inhaler and should not be used for acute
      bronchospasm. Patients should use a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) for

## **Usage**

Formoterol + Mometasone is prescribed for the **maintenance treatment of asthma** in patients 5 years and older not adequately controlled on a long-term asthma control medication (e.g., inhaled corticosteroid) or whose disease severity warrants initiation of treatment with both an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting β₂-adrenergic agonist (LABA).  It is **not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm**.

It is classified as a **combination inhaler medication** containing both an **inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)** (mometasone) and a **long-acting beta-agonist (LABA)** (formoterol).


## **Alternate Names**

This combination is commonly known as **Mometasone/Formoterol**. A popular brand name is **Dulera**.  Zenhale is another brand name for this combination.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Mometasone:**  Exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the airways, reducing airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness.
* **Formoterol:** Relaxes bronchial smooth muscle by stimulating β₂-adrenergic receptors, leading to bronchodilation and improved airflow.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Mometasone:** Low systemic bioavailability (<1%) due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Excreted mainly in feces. Terminal elimination half-life is approximately 5 hours.
* **Formoterol:** Rapidly absorbed. Metabolized in the liver via direct glucuronidation and O-demethylation. Excreted primarily in urine. Terminal elimination half-life approximately 10 hours.

**Mode of Action:**

Mometasone acts by binding to glucocorticoid receptors, modulating gene transcription to suppress inflammatory mediators. Formoterol activates β₂-adrenergic receptors, increasing intracellular cAMP levels and leading to smooth muscle relaxation.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (≥12 years):**

Two inhalations (puffs) twice daily (morning and evening) of either 100 mcg/5 mcg or 200 mcg/5 mcg strength. The maximum dose is 800 mcg mometasone/20 mcg formoterol per day.

#### **Children (5-11 years):**

Two inhalations twice daily of the 50 mcg/5 mcg strength. The maximum dose is 200 mcg mometasone/20 mcg formoterol per day.

#### **Children (under 5 years):**

Use and dose must be determined by the child's doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments, but monitor for potential adverse effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment data available.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Close monitoring is needed, as effects may be increased due to slower removal of the medicine from the body.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution advised in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, seizures, thyroid problems, etc.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Formoterol + Mometasone is *not* indicated for acute conditions requiring intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It is for *maintenance* treatment of asthma.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjust the dosage individually based on the severity of the disease and the patient's response. Titrate to the lowest effective dose once control is achieved.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Headache, throat irritation, upper respiratory tract infection, hoarseness, oral candidiasis (thrush).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., rash, angioedema), paradoxical bronchospasm,  adrenal suppression, pneumonia,  osteoporosis.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Growth retardation in children, decreased bone mineral density, cataracts, glaucoma.



## **Contraindications**

* Status asthmaticus or other acute asthma episodes
* Hypersensitivity to mometasone, formoterol, or any component of the formulation.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors** (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole): May increase plasma concentrations of mometasone.
* **Beta-blockers:** May antagonize the bronchodilating effects of formoterol.
* **Other drugs that prolong the QTc interval:** May increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias when used with formoterol.
* **MAO inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants:** Caution advised.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Use only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:** Limited data available. Exercise caution.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Mometasone: Inhaled corticosteroid, reduces airway inflammation. Formoterol: LABA, bronchodilator.
* **Side Effects:**  Thrush, headache, upper respiratory tract infection,  hoarseness. Serious: Adrenal suppression, hypersensitivity reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Status asthmaticus, hypersensitivity.

* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Asthma control,  growth in children,  bone mineral density (long-term use), adverse effects.


## **Popular Combinations**

Formoterol + Mometasone is itself a popular combination. Not typically combined with other controller medications except in severe asthma not controlled with other treatments.


## **Precautions**
