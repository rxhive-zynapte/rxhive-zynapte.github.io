## **Usage**

Formoterol + Tiotropium is prescribed for the long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It is also indicated for the long-term maintenance treatment of asthma in patients 6 years and older.

It's pharmacological classification is *bronchodilator* (specifically, a combination of a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist).

The mechanism of action involves relaxing the muscles in the airways. Formoterol stimulates beta2-adrenergic receptors leading to bronchodilation, while Tiotropium blocks muscarinic cholinergic receptors, further enhancing bronchodilation and reducing mucus secretion.

## **Alternate Names**

There isn't a single international non-proprietary name for the combination. It is often referred to by the generic names of its components. 

Brand names include *Tiovair-F*, and *Stiolto Respimat* (containing tiotropium and olodaterol, a similar LABA).

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Formoterol, a LABA, stimulates beta2-adrenergic receptors in the lungs, activating adenylate cyclase and increasing intracellular cyclic AMP. This leads to bronchial smooth muscle relaxation. Tiotropium, a LAMA, competitively and reversibly inhibits muscarinic (M1, M2, and M3) receptors, reducing bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion. The combined effect produces sustained bronchodilation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Formoterol:**  Rapidly absorbed after inhalation, with peak plasma concentrations reached within 5-10 minutes. Metabolized primarily by direct glucuronidation and eliminated via renal excretion.
* **Tiotropium:** Absorbed partially from the lungs after inhalation.  Systemic bioavailability is low (around 20-30%). Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine, with a terminal elimination half-life of 25-45 hours in COPD patients and 34-44 hours in asthma patients.

**Mode of Action:** At the cellular level, Formoterol acts on beta2-adrenergic receptors, leading to smooth muscle relaxation via a cAMP-mediated pathway. Tiotropium blocks the effect of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, preventing bronchoconstriction.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (COPD):**  One inhalation (containing 5 mcg tiotropium and 5 mcg olodaterol, or 18 mcg tiotropium and 12 mcg formoterol dry powder capsule) once daily using the appropriate inhaler device (e.g. Respimat or HandiHaler).

#### **Adults (Asthma):** One inhalation (containing 2.5 mcg tiotropium and 2.5 mcg formoterol) once daily.


#### **Children (Asthma):**  For ages 6 years and older: 2.5 mcg tiotropium and 2.5 mcg formoterol via inhalation once daily. Safety and efficacy have not been established for children under 6.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is typically required. However, monitor closely for adverse effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised in moderate to severe renal impairment. Monitor closely.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment is typically required. However, monitor closely.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hyperplasia, bladder-neck obstruction, hyperthyroidism, or seizure disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Formoterol + Tiotropium is **not** indicated for acute bronchospasm or emergency situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or cardiac arrest. It is for *maintenance* treatment.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Dry mouth, cough, nasopharyngitis, headache, dizziness, sore throat, hoarseness, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, gastrointestinal upset.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Paradoxical bronchospasm, angioedema, narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, cardiac arrhythmias (palpitations, tachycardia), allergic reactions.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to tiotropium, formoterol, atropine, or its derivatives. Narrow-angle glaucoma.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Beta-blockers**: Can antagonize the bronchodilatory effects of formoterol.
* **Other Anticholinergics**: May increase anticholinergic side effects (e.g., dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention).
* **Diuretics**: May lead to hypokalemia, increasing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias with formoterol.
* **MAO inhibitors**: May potentiate the cardiovascular effects of formoterol.
* **Tricyclic antidepressants**: May enhance the cardiovascular effects of formoterol.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy: Limited data available.  Generally avoided unless the benefits outweigh the risks.

Breastfeeding:  It is unknown if tiotropium/formoterol is excreted in human milk. Caution is advised.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Bronchodilation through beta2-adrenergic agonism (formoterol) and muscarinic antagonism (tiotropium).
* **Side Effects:** Dry mouth, cough, nasopharyngitis, headache, dizziness, paradoxical bronchospasm, angioedema, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, narrow-angle glaucoma.
* **Drug Interactions:** Beta-blockers, other anticholinergics, diuretics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Limited data. Use with caution.
* **Dosage:** One inhalation daily (specific doses depend on age, indication, and formulation).
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Lung function (FEV1, FVC), blood glucose (in diabetics), serum potassium.


## **Popular Combinations**

Formoterol + Tiotropium is itself a popular combination. Sometimes, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are added to this combination in severe COPD or asthma.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:**  Monitor for paradoxical bronchospasm, cardiac effects, and eye problems (narrow-angle glaucoma). Patients should be trained on proper inhaler technique.
* **Specific Populations:**
    * **Pregnant Women:** Discuss risks and benefits with the physician.
    * **Breastfeeding Mothers:**  Potential for neonatal exposure; discuss risks and benefits with the physician.
    * **Children & Elderly:**  Monitor closely for adverse effects.
