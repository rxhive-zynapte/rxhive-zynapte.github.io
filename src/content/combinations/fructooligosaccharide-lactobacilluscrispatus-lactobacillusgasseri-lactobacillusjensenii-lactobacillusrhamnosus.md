## **Usage**

This combination of prebiotic fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and probiotic *Lactobacillus* species is primarily used to maintain and restore the vaginal microbiota. It is indicated for:

* **Prevention and treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV):** BV is a common vaginal infection resulting from an imbalance of the vaginal flora.
* **Prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women:** Some evidence suggests this combination may help prevent UTIs by promoting a healthy vaginal microbiome.
* **Relief from vaginal dryness:** The lactobacilli in the combination may help maintain vaginal moisture.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Probiotic, prebiotic

**Mechanism of Action:** FOS acts as a prebiotic, nourishing the probiotic *Lactobacillus* species. These lactobacilli colonize the vagina, produce lactic acid, and lower the vaginal pH, creating an environment that inhibits the growth of pathogenic bacteria associated with BV. The lactobacilli also form a protective barrier against pathogen adhesion.

## **Alternate Names**

* Vaginal probiotic
* Probiotic complex
* *Lactobacillus* combination with FOS

**Brand Names:**  OMNi-BiOTiCÂ® FLORA plus, Ecotas BV


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  FOS selectively promotes the growth of beneficial lactobacilli in the vagina. These bacteria produce lactic acid, lowering vaginal pH and inhibiting the growth of pathogenic bacteria. This promotes a healthy vaginal flora.

**Pharmacokinetics:** FOS is not digested in the upper gastrointestinal tract and reaches the colon largely intact. In the colon, it is fermented by the gut microbiota, particularly bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. It is primarily eliminated through fecal excretion. Orally administered lactobacilli may transiently colonize the gastrointestinal tract and contribute to a balanced gut microbiome.  While oral administration can influence vaginal health, the lactobacilli are not typically detected in the vaginal microbiome after a certain period.  The precise mechanism by which orally administered lactobacilli influence vaginal health requires further investigation, though it is postulated to involve modulation of the immune system and competition with pathogens in the gut.


**Mode of Action:** *Lactobacillus* species adhere to the vaginal epithelium, forming a protective barrier against pathogens. They compete with pathogens for nutrients and produce antimicrobial substances like bacteriocins.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** This combination primarily exerts its effects through pH modulation and competitive exclusion, not through direct receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation.


**Elimination Pathways:** FOS is eliminated through fecal excretion.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** One capsule or sachet containing the specified strains and FOS once or twice daily, ideally with water after meals. The dosage may vary depending on the product and the CFU count of each *Lactobacillus* strain.  A common dosage is 2g per sachet or capsule. For two sachets or capsules, the dosage is 4g.

#### **Children:** Use in children under 5 years is generally not recommended unless under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Patients with weakened immune systems (e.g., HIV, chemotherapy) or recurring infections should consult their doctor before use.  Patients with inflammatory bowel disease or gut problems should also consult their doctor.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination isn't typically indicated for conditions like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use. Its primary use is for BV and UTI prevention.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are not typically necessary unless directed by a healthcare professional.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

* Increased gas or bloating
* Stomach cramps
* Flatulence

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Signs of infection (e.g., persistent cough, high fever, chills)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching/swelling, dizziness, trouble breathing)

### **Long-Term Effects**

No long-term adverse effects have been established.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

ADRs are rare but can include severe allergic reactions.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any ingredient, including any *Lactobacillus* species or FOS.
* Individuals with severely compromised immune systems (e.g., undergoing chemotherapy, organ transplant).



## **Drug Interactions**
