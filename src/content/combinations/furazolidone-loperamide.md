## **Usage**

Furazolidone + Loperamide is indicated for the treatment of infectious diarrhea caused by susceptible bacteria or protozoa.  It combines the anti-infective action of furazolidone with the antimotility effect of loperamide.

* **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antidiarrheal (Loperamide), Antibiotic/Antiprotozoal (Furazolidone)

* **Mechanism of Action:** Loperamide slows intestinal motility by binding to opioid receptors in the gut wall, reducing the frequency of bowel movements. Furazolidone inhibits microbial enzymes crucial for bacterial and protozoal growth and replication.

## **Alternate Names**

Furoxone (brand name for Furazolidone, discontinued in some regions); Imodium (brand name for Loperamide).  Avistep and Neostep are examples of brand names for the combined formulation. It's crucial to note that the combined formulation might be restricted or unavailable in certain regions.


## **How It Works**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Loperamide reduces gastrointestinal motility by acting on opioid receptors in the intestinal wall. Furazolidone interferes with microbial DNA replication, leading to bacterial and protozoal cell death.

* **Pharmacokinetics:** Furazolidone is well-absorbed orally and extensively metabolized in the liver, with primary excretion through urine. Loperamide undergoes substantial first-pass metabolism, has low systemic absorption, and is mainly excreted in feces.


* **Mode of Action:** Loperamide is an opioid agonist that acts on Î¼-opioid receptors in the myenteric plexus of the large intestine, reducing peristalsis and increasing intestinal transit time. Furazolidone inhibits several bacterial enzymes, disrupting cell growth and replication.

* **Elimination Pathways:**  Furazolidone is primarily excreted in the urine as metabolites. Loperamide is mostly excreted in feces, with a small amount eliminated in the urine, primarily as conjugates.

## **Dosage**

The dosage of the combined formulation Furazolidone + Loperamide varies based on factors like age, health condition, and the specific formulation.  It's essential to check local guidelines and regulations, as this combination may be unavailable or restricted in some areas.  A doctor should always determine the suitable combined dose if it's available as a combination product. The following information serves as a general overview and not as prescribing instructions.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Furazolidone:** 100 mg four times daily for 5-7 days.
* **Loperamide:** 4 mg initially, followed by 2 mg after each loose stool, with a maximum of 16 mg/day.


#### **Children:**

The combination is generally not recommended for children younger than five years old.  If considered, the dosage must be carefully adjusted based on the child's weight and age, and the child should be closely monitored for side effects. Pediatric dosage for each individual component may vary by region and formulation. Refer to reliable sources or local guidelines for specific pediatric dosing information.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary due to age-related changes in organ function.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage modifications are usually required depending on the level of impairment.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustments are likely needed due to altered drug metabolism.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful evaluation and dose adjustment are necessary for patients with comorbid conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or G6PD deficiency.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The Furazolidone + Loperamide combination is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Loperamide, in specific situations, can be used to manage diarrhea in critically ill patients or those recovering from surgery, but not in combination with Furazolidone.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments should be made based on individual patient factors like renal or hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism. Always consult a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate dose for individual patient needs. 


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, loss of appetite, and discoloration of urine.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), cardiac arrhythmias, QT interval prolongation (especially with high doses of loperamide), mental status changes, hemolytic anemia (especially in patients with G6PD deficiency), hypertensive crisis (with concurrent MAOI use).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Peripheral neuropathy (with prolonged furazolidone use).



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Hemolytic anemia (especially in patients with G6PD deficiency), hypertensive crisis (with concurrent MAOI use), cardiac arrhythmias, QT prolongation.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to either furazolidone or loperamide, acute dysentery (bloody diarrhea), infants under one month old (furazolidone), concurrent use of MAOIs (furazolidone), severe hepatic impairment, patients with a history of Torsades de Pointes, patients with prolonged QT interval.

## **Drug Interactions**

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), alcohol (disulfiram-like reaction with furazolidone), tyramine-rich foods (hypertensive effects with furazolidone), numerous medications metabolized by CYP450 enzymes (may interact with furazolidone), QT prolonging drugs.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Furazolidone should be used cautiously during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Loperamide is generally avoided during pregnancy.  

* **Breastfeeding:** Loperamide is generally considered safe during breastfeeding. Furazolidone should be avoided in infants under one month old and used with caution otherwise. 


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Loperamide decreases gut motility; furazolidone has antimicrobial action.

* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, constipation, dizziness, potential cardiac effects, discoloration of urine.

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, acute dysentery, concurrent MAOI use.

* **Drug Interactions:** MAOIs, alcohol, tyramine-rich foods, various medications.

* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution in pregnancy, if at all. Loperamide is generally considered safe during breastfeeding while Furazolidone's use requires caution.


* **Dosage:** Varies depending on age, condition, and formulation. Consult guidelines and a doctor.

* **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for adverse reactions, hydration status, electrolyte balance, cardiac effects.

## **Popular Combinations**

Although the combined formulation may be limited, doctors might sometimes prescribe furazolidone and loperamide separately to treat infectious diarrhea. Alternative antibiotic options based on the identified pathogen may be used in conjunction with loperamide.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Evaluate renal and hepatic function before prescribing. Screen for G6PD deficiency. Advise patients to avoid alcohol and tyramine-rich foods while taking furazolidone.

* **Specific Populations:**
    * **Pregnant Women:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
    * **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Avoid furazolidone in infants under one month of age.
    * **Children & Elderly:**  Careful dosing adjustments are needed.

* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Advise against consuming alcohol while taking furazolidone and for up to four days after treatment to prevent potential reactions.
