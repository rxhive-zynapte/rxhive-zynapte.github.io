## **Usage**

Furazolidone + Metronidazole is a combination antibiotic used to treat bacterial and protozoal infections, particularly gastrointestinal infections like giardiasis, amoebiasis, and bacterial diarrhea.  It's also effective against infections caused by susceptible gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

* **Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic, Antiprotozoal
* **Mechanism of Action:** Furazolidone inhibits bacterial and protozoal protein synthesis, while metronidazole damages DNA of anaerobic bacteria and protozoa, disrupting their growth and replication.

## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination, though it might be locally referred to by various names depending on the region or manufacturer.

* **Brand Names:** Metrogyl F, Furazole M, Anaerid F.


## **How It Works**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Furazolidone disrupts protein synthesis by interfering with ribosomal function. Metronidazole forms toxic free radicals that damage DNA and other essential macromolecules within anaerobic microorganisms.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Both drugs are absorbed orally. Furazolidone is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine. Metronidazole is also metabolized in the liver, with both renal and hepatic excretion.
* **Mode of Action:**
    * Furazolidone: Inhibits protein synthesis, disrupting ribosomal function.
    * Metronidazole:  Damages DNA and other essential macromolecules of susceptible anaerobic microorganisms by forming free radicals.
* **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Furazolidone acts as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). Metronidazole's mechanism involves interaction with microbial DNA.
* **Elimination Pathways:**  Both drugs are primarily metabolized in the liver. Metabolites and some parent drug are excreted in urine.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* Standard dose:  Furazolidone 100 mg + Metronidazole 200-400mg four times a day.
* Duration: 5-10 days depending on the infection.


#### **Children:**

* Dose is based on body weight (6mg/kg/day furazolidone, 20-30mg/kg/day metronidazole divided into multiple doses).
* Use in infants under one month is generally avoided due to the risk of hemolytic anemia. Pediatric use requires careful monitoring.



#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary, especially for high doses, due to age-related decline in renal and hepatic function. Monitor closely for adverse events.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are necessary based on creatinine clearance. Monitor drug levels closely.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dose modifications required due to reduced metabolic capacity. Monitor liver function tests and drug levels.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with G6PD deficiency, neurological conditions, or history of seizures. Avoid alcohol during and shortly after treatment.




### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage guidelines for these clinical scenarios aren't specifically defined for this combined formulation. Treatment in these contexts usually involves parenteral administration of metronidazole.


* **Intubation**
* **Surgical Procedures**
* **Mechanical Ventilation**
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
* **Emergency Situations** (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest)




### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosages should be adjusted based on renal/hepatic impairment and response to therapy.  Monitor for adverse effects and adjust accordingly.


## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Metallic taste
* Darkened urine
* Dry mouth


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Peripheral neuropathy
* Seizures
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome
* Psychotic reactions


### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term use of this drug combination is generally avoided due to the potential for toxicity, especially with metronidazole.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

* Hypersensitivity reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Disulfiram-like reaction (flushing, nausea, vomiting, headache) when taken with alcohol



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to either Furazolidone or Metronidazole, or any nitroimidazole derivative
* First trimester of pregnancy (Metronidazole)
* G6PD deficiency (Furazolidone)
* Patients with Cockayne syndrome



## **Drug Interactions**

* Alcohol (Disulfiram-like reaction with Metronidazole)
* Disulfiram
* Warfarin and other anticoagulants
* Lithium
* Phenytoin and other anticonvulsants
* Tyramine-containing foods (Furazolidone)


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Contraindicated in the first trimester. Use with caution in later trimesters only if potential benefit outweighs risk.
* **Breastfeeding:** Metronidazole is excreted in breast milk.  Advise mothers to express and discard milk during treatment and for 24-48 hours after the last dose, or consider temporarily discontinuing breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Furazolidone: Inhibits protein synthesis. Metronidazole: Damages microbial DNA.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, headache, metallic taste, darkened urine, peripheral neuropathy (rare).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, first trimester pregnancy, G6PD deficiency, Cockayne syndrome.
* **Drug Interactions:** Alcohol, Disulfiram, anticoagulants, lithium, anticonvulsants.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in the first trimester; use with caution in later trimesters. Advise discarding breast milk during and after treatment.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 100 mg furazolidone + 200-400mg metronidazole four times/day.  Pediatric: Weight-based.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Complete blood count, liver function tests, renal function tests, signs of neurological toxicity.



## **Popular Combinations**

 This drug is commonly used as a standalone combination. Combining it with other antibiotics is generally not recommended due to increased risk of side effects and potential loss of efficacy.


## **Precautions**

* Obtain a detailed medical history, including allergy information and current medications.
* Monitor closely for side effects, particularly neurological and hematological effects.
* Screen for G6PD deficiency before prescribing furazolidone.
* Counsel patients to avoid alcohol during and shortly after treatment with metronidazole.
* Monitor liver and kidney function in patients with pre-existing hepatic or renal disease.
