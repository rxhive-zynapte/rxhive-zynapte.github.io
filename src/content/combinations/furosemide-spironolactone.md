## **Usage**

Furosemide + Spironolactone is prescribed for the treatment of edema (fluid overload) and hypertension (high blood pressure), especially in conditions involving secondary hyperaldosteronism, such as congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and nephritic syndrome.  It is classified as a combination diuretic. The combination works by increasing urine output, thereby reducing fluid overload and lowering blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is often referred to as a loop diuretic (furosemide) plus a potassium-sparing diuretic (spironolactone).  Brand names for this combination include Spiromide.  Frusemide is another name for Furosemide.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Furosemide inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption in the ascending loop of Henle, leading to increased excretion of water, sodium, potassium, and chloride. Spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, acts on the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct, inhibiting sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. The combination provides synergistic diuresis while mitigating potassium loss associated with furosemide.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Furosemide is rapidly absorbed orally and acts within an hour, with a half-life of 1–2 hours. It is primarily excreted renally. Spironolactone is well-absorbed orally and extensively metabolized. Its active metabolite, canrenone, has a longer half-life (around 10–35 hours) and is also excreted renally.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The starting dose is typically 20-40 mg of furosemide and 50-100 mg of spironolactone daily, administered orally.  The dose can be adjusted based on the patient's response, up to a maximum of 400 mg of spironolactone and 160 mg of furosemide per day. Divided doses may be used for higher dosages.

#### **Children:**

The combination of furosemide and spironolactone is generally not recommended for children due to a lack of safety and efficacy data. 

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and monitor renal function closely due to the risk of decreased clearance.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are crucial, potentially requiring lower doses or less frequent administration.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Careful monitoring is necessary due to altered drug metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient factors such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease for dosage adjustments.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Specific dosage recommendations for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations require careful consideration of individual patient needs and hemodynamic status and should be determined in consultation with a specialist. There are not standard dose adjustments for these conditions. The use of these medications in these setting are based on patient status. 


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications should be based on renal function, hepatic function, electrolyte balance, blood pressure response, and other patient-specific factors.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia), dehydration, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, increased urine volume, orthostatic hypotension, increased blood cholesterol, increased uric acid.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Severe hypotension, hyperkalemia (with high doses of spironolactone or in patients with renal impairment), hepatic encephalopathy, gynecomastia (with spironolactone).


### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic electrolyte imbalances, renal dysfunction (with long-term high doses of furosemide).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe hypotension, anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.



## **Contraindications**

Anuria, acute renal insufficiency, severe renal impairment, hyperkalemia, Addison's disease, hypersensitivity to furosemide, spironolactone, or sulfonamides.


## **Drug Interactions**

Many drugs can interact with this combination. Key interactions include:

- **Antihypertensives:** Additive hypotensive effects.
- **NSAIDs:** Reduced diuretic efficacy, increased risk of renal impairment and hyperkalemia.
- **Digoxin:** Increased digoxin levels due to electrolyte disturbances.
- **Lithium:** Increased lithium levels.
- **Potassium supplements:** Increased risk of hyperkalemia.
- **ACE inhibitors, ARBs:** Increased risk of hyperkalemia.
- **Alcohol:** Increased risk of hypotension.




## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Furosemide is generally considered safe during pregnancy, but spironolactone is contraindicated as it can have antiandrogenic effects.  Furosemide is considered safe in breastfeeding, while spironolactone's safety profile isn't established and therefore not recommended.




## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Combination diuretic: loop + potassium-sparing.
- **Side Effects:** Electrolyte imbalances, dehydration, dizziness, hypotension.
- **Contraindications:** Anuria, renal failure, hyperkalemia, Addison's disease.
- **Drug Interactions:** Antihypertensives, NSAIDs, digoxin, lithium, potassium supplements.

- **Dosage:** Individualized, starting with low doses and titrating upwards.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Electrolytes, renal function, blood pressure.



## **Popular Combinations**

While Furosemide + Spironolactone is itself a common combination, additional antihypertensives may be prescribed depending on patient needs.

## **Precautions**

Monitor electrolytes and renal function closely.  Caution in patients with hepatic impairment, diabetes, or gout.
