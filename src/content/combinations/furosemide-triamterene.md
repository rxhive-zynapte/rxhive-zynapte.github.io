## **Usage**

Furosemide + Triamterene is prescribed for the treatment of edema (fluid retention) associated with congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and kidney disease, including nephrotic syndrome. It is also used to manage hypertension (high blood pressure), especially in cases where potassium loss due to furosemide is a concern.  This combination belongs to the pharmacological class of diuretics, specifically a combination of a loop diuretic (furosemide) and a potassium-sparing diuretic (triamterene). Furosemide inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption in the ascending loop of Henle, while triamterene blocks sodium channels in the distal convoluted tubule, reducing potassium loss.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication is sometimes prescribed under other names, such as those containing the individual drugs (e.g., furosemide and triamterene). Brand names for combinations including these two drugs include Fluss. It's important to note that brand names can vary regionally.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Furosemide increases excretion of water, sodium, chloride, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Triamterene reduces potassium loss while still promoting diuresis.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Furosemide:** Rapidly absorbed orally, peak effect in 1 hour.  Metabolized in the liver and primarily excreted by the kidneys.
* **Triamterene:** Well absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine.

**Mode of Action:** Furosemide inhibits the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter in the ascending loop of Henle, increasing diuresis.  Triamterene acts directly on the distal renal tubule, blocking sodium reabsorption and consequently reducing potassium secretion. This minimizes the potassium loss typically caused by furosemide. Elimination pathways for both are mainly renal.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The usual starting dose is one tablet containing 25 mg of triamterene and 40 mg of furosemide once daily, usually taken in the morning. The dose may be adjusted according to individual response and medical condition. Some patients may require a higher dose of one tablet twice daily. It's crucial to monitor electrolyte levels closely, especially potassium.


#### **Children:** The combination of furosemide and triamterene is generally not recommended for children. Furosemide is available in liquid form for pediatric use, but dosing must be carefully calculated based on the child's weight and medical condition. Triamterene is typically not used in children.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lowest possible effective dose and monitor closely due to potential for age-related decreased renal function and increased risk of electrolyte imbalances.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment is necessary based on creatinine clearance. Use with caution and close monitoring.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution and dose adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is crucial, especially in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and gout.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

For the combination of furosemide and triamterene specifically, dosage adjustments for these clinical scenarios are not typically outlined. Furosemide alone is used in these settings: Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, Emergency Situations (e.g., pulmonary edema).  Triamterene is not typically administered in these acute settings.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage must be adjusted in renal impairment and hepatic dysfunction.  Metabolic disorders and genetic polymorphisms influencing drug metabolism also necessitate careful dose adjustment. Electrolyte abnormalities require careful correction and might require holding the medication until they are addressed.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, dry mouth, thirst, nausea, vomiting, weakness, and muscle cramps.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), severe hypotension (low blood pressure), kidney stones, acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, blood disorders, and allergic reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Electrolyte imbalances (especially hypokalemia and hyperkalemia), gout, and photosensitivity.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and potentially life-threatening electrolyte disturbances.



## **Contraindications**

Anuria (no urine output), severe kidney disease, severe liver disease, hyperkalemia, and hypersensitivity to furosemide or triamterene.


## **Drug Interactions**

ACE inhibitors, ARBs, other potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., amiloride, spironolactone), potassium supplements, NSAIDs, digoxin, lithium, certain antibiotics (aminoglycosides), and antidiabetic medications. Alcohol can enhance the hypotensive effect.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

This combination should be used with extreme caution during pregnancy, only if absolutely necessary. Furosemide can cross the placenta and may cause fetal diuresis. Triamterene is classified by the FDA as Pregnancy Risk Category C. It is not recommended during breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Furosemide: Inhibits Na-K-2Cl cotransporter in the loop of Henle. Triamterene: Blocks epithelial sodium channels in the distal tubule.
* **Side Effects:** Dizziness, headache, dry mouth, electrolyte imbalances, hyperkalemia, kidney stones.
* **Contraindications:** Anuria, severe kidney/liver disease, hyperkalemia.
* **Drug Interactions:**  ACE inhibitors, ARBs, potassium supplements, NSAIDs, digoxin.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if absolutely needed in pregnancy; avoid during breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** Starting dose is typically 25 mg triamterene/40 mg furosemide once daily, adjustable based on individual response.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Serum electrolytes (potassium, sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium), creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), uric acid, and blood pressure.

## **Popular Combinations**

This combination itself represents a commonly used approach in managing edema and hypertension where potassium loss is a concern.



## **Precautions**

General precautions include assessment of renal and hepatic function, electrolyte levels, and blood pressure before starting treatment. Close monitoring for electrolyte abnormalities, dehydration, and kidney function throughout therapy is essential. In pregnant women, benefits versus fetal risks should be carefully evaluated. The use of this combination is not recommended during breastfeeding. For children and the elderly, careful dose adjustments and enhanced monitoring are required. Patients should be advised to limit sun exposure due to potential photosensitivity. Alcohol consumption should be avoided or limited, as it may increase the risk of hypotension. Patients should be alerted to the potential for dizziness and should be advised to avoid operating machinery or driving if this occurs.
