## **Usage**

Fusidic acid + halobetasol is prescribed for short-term treatment of inflammatory skin disorders complicated by secondary bacterial infection. This includes conditions like infected eczema, atopic dermatitis, and psoriasis.  It combines an antibiotic and a corticosteroid.

**Pharmacological Classification:** 
* Fusidic acid: Antibiotic
* Halobetasol: Corticosteroid

**Mechanism of Action:** Fusidic acid inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, while halobetasol provides potent anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive effects.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for this specific combination. However, the individual components have other names.  Various brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region. Brand names include Halovate-F, Halobik-F and Halox F.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Halobetasol propionate, a potent corticosteroid, binds to glucocorticoid receptors, reducing inflammation by suppressing the migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and reversing capillary permeability. Fusidic acid, a bacteriostatic antibiotic, inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by targeting elongation factor G (EF-G).

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:** Halobetasol's topical absorption varies; factors like skin condition, site, and use of occlusive dressings affect it. Absorption increases with inflammation and occlusion. Fusidic acid has minimal systemic absorption when applied topically.
* **Metabolism:** Halobetasol is metabolized primarily in the liver. Fusidic acid is also extensively metabolized, although the specific pathways are less well-defined.
* **Elimination:** Primarily via urine for both halobetasol and fusidic acid, either directly or as metabolites.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Apply a thin layer to the affected skin area once or twice daily for up to two weeks. The total weekly dose should not exceed 50g.

#### **Children:** Use in children under 12 years of age is generally not recommended, although specific formulations under physician guidance might be an exception for children over 1 year of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Similar to adult dosing. Monitor for potential increased systemic absorption with prolonged use.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution advised. Dosage adjustments may be needed based on the degree of impairment. Systemic absorption increases the likelihood of renal effects.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution advised. Dosage adjustments may be needed. Both drugs undergo hepatic metabolism.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Patients with diabetes, Cushing's syndrome, glaucoma, cataracts, or thyroid/pituitary diseases should use this combination with caution. Monitor blood glucose levels in diabetic patients.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Fusidic acid + halobetasol is not typically indicated for use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU/emergency situations. It's intended for topical treatment of localized skin infections.

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**
* Burning
* Itching
* Irritation
* Dryness
* Redness at application site
* Thinning of skin


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling)
* Worsening of infection
* Skin atrophy
* Telangiectasia
* Hyperglycemia (especially in diabetic patients)
* Cushing's syndrome (with prolonged use or over large areas)
* Glaucoma or cataracts (with prolonged use near the eyes)


### **Long-Term Effects**
* Skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasia (with prolonged use)
* Hypopigmentation
* Secondary infections

## **Contraindications**
* Hypersensitivity to fusidic acid or halobetasol
* Viral skin infections (e.g., herpes simplex, varicella)
* Fungal skin infections
* Tuberculous skin infections
* Rosacea
* Acne
* Perioral dermatitis

## **Drug Interactions**

* Other topical corticosteroids: Increased risk of systemic effects
* Oral corticosteroids: Increased risk of systemic effects
* Immunosuppressants: Additive immunosuppressive effects.
* Drugs metabolized by CYP3A4:  Halobetasol's metabolism is primarily by CYP3A4, thus consider potential drug interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole) or inducers (e.g., rifampicin).




## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established.  Avoid application on large areas or prolonged usage. Do not apply to the breasts if breastfeeding.  Consult a physician before using this combination during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.
