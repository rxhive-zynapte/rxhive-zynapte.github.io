## **Usage**

Fusidic acid + mometasone is a topical combination medication primarily prescribed for inflammatory skin conditions complicated by bacterial infections.  These include:

* Infected eczema
* Atopic dermatitis
* Impetigo
* Folliculitis
* Furunculosis

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Fusidic acid: Antibiotic
* Mometasone: Corticosteroid

**Mechanism of Action:**  Fusidic acid works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis, primarily affecting gram-positive bacteria like *Staphylococcus aureus*. Mometasone, a potent corticosteroid, reduces inflammation by suppressing the production of inflammatory mediators.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is known simply as mometasone + fusidic acid. Several brand names exist, including Bactirest-M, Mometone-F, Fusiwal M, and Fezigrip-M, among others.  Availability and specific brand names may vary regionally.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Fusidic acid acts as a bacteriostatic agent, preventing bacterial growth and replication. Mometasone exerts anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Following topical application, systemic absorption of both components is minimal, especially with intact skin.
* **Metabolism:**  Absorbed mometasone undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism. Fusidic acid's metabolism is less well-defined in topical formulations.
* **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion for mometasone, and primarily biliary excretion for fusidic acid.

**Mode of Action:** Fusidic acid inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by preventing the translocation of elongation factor G (EF-G) from the ribosome. Mometasone binds to glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm, translocates to the nucleus, and modulates gene transcription, ultimately reducing inflammation.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer to the affected skin area twice daily.  The treatment duration should generally not exceed two weeks.

#### **Children:** Use in children under 12 requires careful physician supervision. For children over 1 year, the adult dose may be used, but younger children may require dosage adjustments. One suggested pediatric dosing regimen is:

* <1 year: 50 mg (1 mL)/kg daily divided into 3 equal doses.
* 1-5 years: 250 mg (5 mL) three times a day.
* >5-12 years: 500 mg (10 mL) three times a day.
Always consult a doctor for appropriate pediatric dosing.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are usually required, but caution is advised due to age-related skin thinning.
* **Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are generally recommended, but use with caution.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use cautiously in patients with diabetes, Cushing's disease, cataracts, glaucoma, thyroid or pituitary diseases, and heart, liver, or kidney problems.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of fusidic acid + mometasone in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations is not standard practice. This combination is specifically indicated for topical treatment of dermatological conditions.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
* Burning sensation
* Itching
* Irritation
* Dryness
* Redness at the application site

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
* Skin atrophy
* Telangiectasia (dilated blood vessels)
* Folliculitis
* Acneiform eruptions
* Allergic reactions (rash, difficulty breathing, swelling)

### **Long-Term Effects:**  Prolonged use may lead to skin thinning, striae (stretch marks), and other corticosteroid-related complications.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to fusidic acid, mometasone, or any component of the formulation.
* Primary bacterial infections like tuberculosis or syphilis affecting the skin.
* Viral skin infections (e.g., herpes simplex, varicella).
* Rosacea.
* Acne.
* Perioral dermatitis.

## **Drug Interactions**

* Interactions with other topical medications applied concurrently to the same area should be considered.
* Although systemic absorption is minimal, potential interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, ketoconazole) and some antibiotics (e.g., chloramphenicol) have been noted.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been definitively established.  Use with caution and only if potential benefits outweigh the risks. Consult a doctor before using if pregnant or breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Fusidic acid: Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. Mometasone: Binds to glucocorticoid receptors, reducing inflammation.
* **Side Effects:** Itching, burning, irritation, dryness, skin atrophy (with prolonged use).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, primary bacterial/viral skin infections.
* **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors, some antibiotics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution; consult a physician.
* **Dosage:** Apply thinly twice daily, not exceeding two weeks.

## **Precautions**

* Avoid contact with eyes, nose, and mouth.
* Not for use on broken skin, open wounds, or under occlusive dressings unless directed by a physician.
* Do not use for diaper rash.
* Use cautiously in patients with diabetes or other medical conditions as mentioned earlier.
