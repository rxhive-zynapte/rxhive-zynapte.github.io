      Are there any drug interactions I should be aware of?**


      **A:** Topical application minimizes systemic drug interactions.  However,
      be cautious with concomitant use of other topical products.  If the
      patient is also taking oral gabapentin, be aware of potential interactions
      with CNS depressants (opioids, benzodiazepines), antacids, and
      hydrocodone.

      Can this cream/gel be used during pregnancy or while breastfeeding?**


      **A:**  Consult a physician before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
      Both gabapentin and lidocaine can cross the placenta and are excreted in
      breast milk, though lidocaine is generally considered compatible with
      breastfeeding.

## **Usage**

- This combination medication, typically in topical gel or cream form, is primarily prescribed for the management of neuropathic pain, particularly postherpetic neuralgia (nerve pain following shingles). It may also be used for other localized neuropathic pain syndromes.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Analgesic (pain reliever), specifically a combination of an anticonvulsant (gabapentin) and a local anesthetic (lidocaine).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Gabapentin binds to the alpha2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, reducing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters and thus decreasing neuronal excitability. Lidocaine blocks sodium channels, inhibiting nerve impulse transmission and leading to local anesthesia.  The combination provides synergistic pain relief.

## **Alternate Names**

- Gabapentin/Lidocaine
-  There are no widely recognized international variations of the name.
- **Brand Names:**  Lidotin cream/gel/kit (note that availability and specific brand names vary by region).  Individual components are marketed under various brand names (e.g., Neurontin for gabapentin, Xylocaine for lidocaine).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Gabapentin acts centrally to decrease neuronal excitability, while lidocaine acts locally to block nerve impulse conduction.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  *Topical Administration:* Gabapentin has limited systemic absorption when applied topically. Lidocaine can be absorbed systemically through the skin, especially when applied to large areas or for extended periods, or if the skin is broken. *Oral gabapentin:* Absorbed from the GI tract, peak plasma concentrations reached in 2-3 hours. Not extensively metabolized. Excreted renally. *Lidocaine (if administered systemically - injection):* Metabolized rapidly in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4. Excreted in urine.
- **Mode of Action:** Gabapentin's exact mechanism in neuropathic pain is not fully understood but involves binding to the alpha2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels. Lidocaine blocks voltage-gated sodium channels in neurons.
- **Receptor binding/Enzyme inhibition/Neurotransmitter modulation:** Gabapentin primarily binds to the alpha2-delta subunit. Lidocaine doesn't bind to specific receptors but acts on voltage-gated sodium channels.
- **Elimination pathways:** Gabapentin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Lidocaine is metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- *Topical*: Apply a thin layer to the affected area as directed by the physician, typically 3-4 times daily.  Specific dosing and maximum application area should be determined by the prescriber based on the patient's condition and response.

#### **Children:**

- Safety and effectiveness in children under 18 have not been established for topical gabapentin/lidocaine combinations.  Oral gabapentin has approved pediatric dosing for seizures.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Start at the lower end of the dosing range and monitor closely for adverse effects. 
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments for topical use are generally not necessary as systemic absorption is minimal.  Oral gabapentin requires dose reduction based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, particularly with systemic lidocaine administration. Topical use may require monitoring for systemic effects.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate on a case-by-case basis.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- The combination is not typically used for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest. Lidocaine, as a single agent, is frequently used in these settings.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dosage adjustments are primarily based on patient response and tolerability for topical use.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- *Topical use:* Itching, burning, redness, or irritation at the application site.  Systemic side effects (dizziness, drowsiness) are less common with topical application.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling).
- *With systemic exposure (e.g., high doses of topical or oral gabapentin):*  Changes in mood or behavior, suicidal thoughts, peripheral edema, dizziness, ataxia, nystagmus.
- *With systemic lidocaine:*  Bradycardia, hypotension, seizures, cardiac arrest (rare).

### **Long-Term Effects**

- There is limited data on long-term effects of the topical combination.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

-  Serious allergic reactions.  Significant CNS effects with systemic absorption.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to gabapentin or lidocaine.  
- Application to broken skin or open wounds. 
- Severe heart block (for systemic lidocaine).

## **Drug Interactions**

- Interactions with other topically applied products are possible (consult physician).
- Systemic interactions are more likely with oral gabapentin.  It can enhance CNS depressant effects of other drugs (e.g., opioids, benzodiazepines).
- Antacids may reduce oral gabapentin absorption.
-  Hydrocodone can increase gabapentin serum levels.
- Alcohol should be avoided as it can potentiate CNS depression.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Gabapentin: Pregnancy Category C. Use only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
- Lidocaine: Pregnancy Category B.  Generally considered safe for short-term use during pregnancy.
- Gabapentin is present in breast milk.  Lidocaine is also excreted in breast milk but is considered compatible with breastfeeding by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

## **Drug Profile Summary**
(as above)


## **Popular Combinations**

-  Topical gabapentin/lidocaine is often used alone.  Oral gabapentin may be combined with other analgesics (NSAIDs, opioids) or antidepressants (tricyclics, SNRIs) in the management of neuropathic pain.
