      systemically. With topical application, the systemic absorption is very
      low so the risk is also minimal.

## **Usage**

- Gatifloxacin + Ketorolac ophthalmic solution is prescribed for the treatment and prevention of post-operative ocular inflammation and pain, and bacterial conjunctivitis (pink eye).  It is also effective in managing ocular burning, irritation, and itching associated with eye surgeries.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**
    * Gatifloxacin: Fluoroquinolone antibiotic
    * Ketorolac: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)
- **Mechanism of Action:**
    * Gatifloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair, thereby killing bacteria.
    * Ketorolac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing the production of prostaglandins, which mediate inflammation and pain.

## **Alternate Names**

- This combination medication may be referred to as Gatifloxacin/Ketorolac ophthalmic solution.
- **Brand Names:** Ketogate, Gatilox Plus, Gcom, Ketomar


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**
    * Gatifloxacin exerts its bactericidal effect by disrupting bacterial DNA synthesis.
    * Ketorolac provides analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    * Both drugs are administered topically to the eye.  Systemic absorption is minimal.
    * Metabolism and elimination pathways for the ophthalmic solution are not well-defined as systemic exposure is low.
- **Mode of Action:**
    * Gatifloxacin targets bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.
    * Ketorolac targets COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily local elimination, with limited systemic involvement.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Instill one drop into the affected eye(s) four times daily.

- Watery eyes
- Blurred vision
- Headache
- Changes in taste


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Severe eye pain
