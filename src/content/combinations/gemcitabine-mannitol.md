## **Usage**

Gemcitabine, often administered with Mannitol as a part of the infusion solution, is prescribed for various cancers, including:

*   **Bladder cancer:** Locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer.
*   **Breast cancer:**  Metastatic breast cancer (often in combination with other chemotherapy drugs).
*   **Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC):**  In combination with cisplatin for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC.
*   **Ovarian cancer:** In combination with carboplatin.
*   **Pancreatic cancer:**  Metastatic pancreatic cancer (sometimes combined with other therapies).

**Pharmacological classification:** Gemcitabine is an antineoplastic antimetabolite, specifically a pyrimidine analog.  Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic.

**Mechanism of Action:** Gemcitabine interferes with DNA synthesis, inhibiting cell growth and division, primarily affecting cells in the S phase (DNA synthesis phase) of the cell cycle.  It gets incorporated into DNA and inhibits further DNA elongation and repair, leading to cell death. Mannitol is used to increase the excretion of certain toxic substances and reduce intracranial and intraocular pressure. When used with Gemcitabine, mannitol primarily acts as a vehicle for administration.

## **Alternate Names**

Gemcitabine hydrochloride is the chemical name. Mannitol is also known as D-mannitol.

**Brand names:** Gemzar, Gemcitabine Kabi, Gemtero.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics (Gemcitabine):** Gemcitabine is a prodrug that needs to be converted into active metabolites (gemcitabine diphosphate and triphosphate) inside the cell. These metabolites exert their cytotoxic effects by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase (decreasing deoxynucleotide pools, including dCTP) and competing with dCTP for incorporation into DNA. Gemcitabine triphosphate incorporation into DNA causes masked chain termination, inhibiting DNA synthesis and repair mechanisms, ultimately leading to apoptosis (programmed cell death) of rapidly dividing cancer cells.

**Pharmacokinetics (Gemcitabine):** It is administered intravenously and rapidly metabolized, primarily by cytidine deaminase in the liver, kidney, blood, and other tissues. Elimination occurs mainly through renal excretion, with less than 10% excreted unchanged.  The half-life is short, ranging from 32-94 minutes after a 30-minute infusion.

**Pharmacodynamics (Mannitol):**  Mannitol exerts its osmotic effects by remaining primarily within the extracellular compartment, increasing osmotic pressure. This pulls fluid from intracellular and interstitial spaces into the vascular system, increasing diuresis. In the brain, it reduces edema and intracranial pressure by decreasing interstitial fluid volume.

**Pharmacokinetics (Mannitol):** Mannitol is administered intravenously and is not metabolized.  It is excreted unchanged through the kidneys, with its serum half-life being about 100 minutes in individuals with normal renal function.  Impaired renal function will prolong half-life.

## **Dosage**

Gemcitabine dosing is based on body surface area (BSA, calculated from height and weight). Mannitol is used as an excipient in Gemcitabine formulations and its quantity doesn't directly affect the dosage of Gemcitabine.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Gemcitabine dosage varies depending on the cancer being treated and concurrent chemotherapy:

*   **Ovarian Cancer:** 1000 mg/m² IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle in combination with carboplatin.
*   **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer:** 1000 mg/m² IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle, often combined with cisplatin.
*   **Breast Cancer:** 1250 mg/m² IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle, often combined with paclitaxel.
*   **Bladder Cancer:** 1000 mg/m² IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle, often combined with cisplatin.

#### **Children:**

The safety and efficacy of gemcitabine in pediatric patients have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly patients:** Dose reduction may be necessary due to decreased renal function. Close monitoring is crucial.
*   **Patients with renal impairment:** Dose reduction is required. Dosage should be based on creatinine clearance.
*   **Patients with hepatic dysfunction:**  Caution is advised, and close monitoring of liver function tests is necessary. Dose modifications might be necessary.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of Gemcitabine + Mannitol is primarily for chemotherapy regimens as outlined above.  Mannitol's specific use in intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU care, and emergency situations are independent of gemcitabine administration.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are required for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, myelosuppression, or other significant toxicities.
