## **Usage**

This topical medication is prescribed for inflammatory skin conditions with bacterial and fungal infections.  It is effective against conditions such as:

* Infected eczema
* Infected contact dermatitis
* Infected seborrheic dermatitis
* Infected psoriasis
* Intertrigo
* Ringworm
* Athlete's foot
* Jock itch

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Corticosteroid (Halobetasol)
* Aminoglycoside Antibiotic (Gentamicin)
* Imidazole Antifungal (Miconazole)


**Mechanism of Action:** This triple combination medication provides a comprehensive approach to treating skin infections.

* **Halobetasol:**  Reduces inflammation by inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes.
* **Gentamicin:** Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, leading to bacterial cell death.
* **Miconazole:** Disrupts fungal cell membrane synthesis by inhibiting ergosterol production, causing fungal cell death.


## **Alternate Names**

* Supacor GM
* Sonaderm-GM
* Other brand names may exist regionally.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Halobetasol:** Binds to glucocorticoid receptors, modifying gene transcription and reducing inflammatory responses.
* **Gentamicin:** Interferes with bacterial protein synthesis, leading to cell death.
* **Miconazole:** Inhibits ergosterol synthesis, a critical component of fungal cell membranes, leading to fungal cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* Limited systemic absorption occurs with topical application.  Absorption is increased when applied to large areas, for prolonged periods, to broken skin, or under occlusive dressings.
* Metabolism primarily occurs in the liver (Halobetasol, Miconazole), with some renal metabolism of Gentamicin.
* Excretion is primarily renal for Gentamicin and fecal for Miconazole and Halobetasol.

**Mode of Action:** The combined action of the three components addresses the inflammatory, bacterial, and fungal aspects of the skin condition.

* Receptor binding (Halobetasol - glucocorticoid receptors)
* Enzyme inhibition (Miconazole - ergosterol synthesis)


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a thin layer to the affected skin area twice daily. Gently and completely rub in. 

* Do not use for more than two weeks.
* Limit use to 50g per week.
* Discontinue use when control is achieved.

#### **Children:**

* Not recommended for children under 2 years old.
* For children over 2, follow adult dosing guidelines but avoid prolonged use, especially on the face or in skin folds. Do not exceed five days of use on the face or in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution. Monitor for adverse effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use cautiously and consider renal function when dosing. Prolonged use or use over large areas may increase the risk of systemic absorption and nephrotoxicity.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Systemic absorption, though limited, may be affected by hepatic function.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor carefully. Pre-existing skin conditions like rosacea, acne, or perioral dermatitis may be exacerbated. Diabetes, glaucoma, cataracts, adrenal gland, or liver problems may increase the risk of systemic adverse events with long-term or high-dose use.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication is primarily indicated for topical skin infections. The standard dosage recommendations apply. Dosages for specific situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations are not specifically defined for this topical medication.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are generally not required but may be necessary in special populations based on patient tolerance, extent and severity of the skin condition, and potential drug interactions.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Burning or stinging at the application site
* Itching
* Dryness
* Redness
* Peeling or flaking skin
* Irritation

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Skin atrophy (thinning)
* Telangiectasia (spider veins)
* Hypopigmentation (skin lightening)
* Hypertrichosis (increased hair growth)
* Systemic absorption and associated side effects with overuse

### **Long-Term Effects**

* Skin atrophy
* Striae (stretch marks)
* Telangiectasia
* Cushing's syndrome (with excessive use)
* Glaucoma, cataracts (with prolonged use near eyes)

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema)
* Systemic toxicity (nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity with gentamicin) – rare with topical application unless applied to large areas or used for extended durations.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any of the components
* Viral skin infections (herpes, chickenpox, shingles)
* Rosacea
* Acne
* Perioral dermatitis
* Use near the eyes with caution

## **Drug Interactions**

* Antifungals (e.g., itraconazole): May increase systemic absorption of Miconazole.
* Anti-HIV/AIDS drugs (e.g., ritonavir): May inhibit the metabolism of Halobetasol.
* Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin): Increased monitoring is necessary.
* Other Nephrotoxic/Ototoxic drugs: Concomitant use with other potentially nephrotoxic or ototoxic drugs should be avoided.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Use only if clearly needed and under close medical supervision.  May be harmful to the developing fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:** Not recommended. Consider the importance of the drug to the mother and potential risk to the infant. If used while breastfeeding, avoid applying to the nipple or areola.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Combined anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antifungal action.
* **Side Effects:**  Burning, itching, dryness, redness, skin atrophy (with long-term use), allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, viral skin infections, rosacea, acne.
* **Drug Interactions:** Antifungals, antivirals, anticoagulants.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution in pregnancy; not recommended while breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** Apply a thin layer twice daily.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Observe for local skin reactions, signs of infection, and systemic effects (especially with prolonged use).

## **Popular Combinations**

This combination itself is commonly used. Avoid concomitant use with other topical medications unless directed by a physician.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Pre-screening for allergies, metabolic disorders, and organ dysfunction.
* **Specific Populations:** See above sections for pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, children, and the elderly.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Avoid alcohol if systemic absorption is a concern (e.g., large areas treated).  No specific driving restrictions, but caution if applying near the eyes.
