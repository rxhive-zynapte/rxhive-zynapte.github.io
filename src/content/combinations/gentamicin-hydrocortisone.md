## **Usage**

Gentamicin + Hydrocortisone is primarily used for the treatment of otitis externa, a bacterial infection of the outer ear. It can also be used for inflammatory ear conditions and post-operatively in infected mastoid cavities after surgery.  This combination is available as ear drops and topical creams/ointments, although the provided information focuses on otic use.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Aminoglycoside antibiotic (gentamicin) and corticosteroid (hydrocortisone).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Gentamicin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis leading to bacterial cell death, while hydrocortisone provides anti-inflammatory and antipruritic effects by suppressing the immune response and reducing capillary permeability.

## **Alternate Names**

Gentamicin and Hydrocortisone Ear Drops is sometimes referred to as Gentisone HC Ear Drops or Genticin HC. Various brand names exist depending on the region and manufacturer (e.g., Gen HC, Genmax HC, Gentabac HC, Gento-HC, Gisin-H).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Gentamicin binds to the 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits of susceptible bacteria, inhibiting protein synthesis and causing bacterial cell death. Hydrocortisone exerts anti-inflammatory action by suppressing the migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and reversing increased capillary permeability.
- **Pharmacokinetics (Otic):** Absorption of gentamicin and hydrocortisone following otic administration is minimal. Systemic effects are generally limited. Elimination pathways for systemically absorbed drug would be renal excretion (gentamicin) and hepatic metabolism (hydrocortisone).
- **Mode of Action:** Gentamicin acts directly on bacterial ribosomes, while hydrocortisone modulates immune responses, suppressing inflammatory mediators.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
The recommended dose is 2-4 drops instilled into the affected ear three to four times daily and at night.

#### **Children:**
Dosage adjustments for children are determined by a doctor. Pediatric dosing information can be found in some sources but may be outdated or incomplete. It's best to consult more recent and comprehensive pediatric resources.


#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustment is generally recommended, but careful monitoring of renal and hepatic function is crucial.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment. Gentamicin is primarily excreted renally. Dose reduction and interval prolongation are guided by renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Careful consideration is required, although no specific adjustment recommendations are available for otic use. Systemic absorption of hydrocortisone is usually minimal.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Pre-existing medical conditions like myasthenia gravis should be considered due to potential for adverse interactions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**
The primary clinical use case for Gentamicin + Hydrocortisone ear drops is otitis externa. It is also used prophylactically after ear trauma or surgery to prevent infection.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
Dosage adjustments must be made in patients with renal impairment due to the nephrotoxic potential of gentamicin.  


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**
Temporary stinging, burning, itching, or redness at the application site.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Hearing loss, ototoxicity (especially with prolonged use or ruptured eardrum), allergic reactions, superinfection.

### **Long-Term Effects**
Prolonged use may lead to fungal superinfections or bacterial resistance.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Rarely, ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity can occur, primarily with systemic absorption (e.g., if the eardrum is perforated).


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to gentamicin, hydrocortisone, or aminoglycoside antibiotics.
- Perforated eardrum (known or suspected).
- Myasthenia gravis.
- Viral infections of the external ear canal (unless secondary bacterial infection is suspected).


## **Drug Interactions**

- Ototoxic or nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., furosemide, cisplatin) may increase the risk of gentamicin toxicity.
- Other corticosteroid-containing products may increase the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects.
- Some medicines for HIV (ritonavir, cobicistat) may increase the effects of Gentisone HC Ear Drops.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.  Safety for use during pregnancy and lactation has not been fully established. The use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is generally not recommended.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Gentamicin: inhibits bacterial protein synthesis; Hydrocortisone: provides anti-inflammatory and antipruritic effects.
- **Side Effects:** Itching, burning, redness, rarely hearing loss or ototoxicity.
- **Contraindications:** Perforated eardrum, hypersensitivity, myasthenia gravis.
- **Drug Interactions:** Ototoxic drugs, other corticosteroids, some HIV medications.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Not recommended unless benefit outweighs risk.
- **Dosage:** 2-4 drops in affected ear 3-4 times daily and at night.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function (in cases of systemic absorption or renal impairment).


## **Popular Combinations**

Gentamicin + Hydrocortisone is itself a commonly used combination.


## **Precautions**

- Ensure that the eardrum is intact before administering the drops.
- Avoid prolonged use to prevent fungal superinfections and bacterial resistance.
- Closely monitor patients with renal impairment.
- Advise patients against inserting cotton wool or other objects into the ear canal during treatment.
