## **Usage**

- Gentamicin + Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose is prescribed for bacterial infections of the eye and outer ear, such as conjunctivitis, blepharitis, keratitis, iritis, cyclitis, and otitis externa. It can also be used to prevent infection after eye injury or surgery.  
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antibiotic (Gentamicin) and Lubricant (Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Gentamicin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, leading to bacterial cell death. Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) acts as a lubricant, providing temporary relief from dryness and irritation.

## **Alternate Names**

- Gentamicin-Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose Drops.
- **Brand Names:** GENTALAB, Geragen-D (Note: Geragen-D includes additional ingredients.), Zonticin D (Note: Zonticin D includes additional ingredients.).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Gentamicin exerts a bactericidal effect. HPMC lubricates the ocular surface, relieving dryness, burning, and irritation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Limited systemic absorption occurs after topical ophthalmic administration.
    - **Metabolism:** Gentamicin is not significantly metabolized.
    - **Elimination:** Gentamicin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine via renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** Gentamicin binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria, interfering with protein synthesis and ultimately leading to cell death. HPMC works by increasing the viscosity of the tear film, thus enhancing lubrication and providing relief from dryness.
- **Elimination pathways:** Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination for Gentamicin.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Ophthalmic:** Instill 1-2 drops into the affected eye(s) every 4-6 hours.  In severe infections, the frequency can be increased to as often as every hour for the initial 24-48 hours, as directed by the physician.
- **Otologic:** Instill 3-4 drops into the affected ear 2-3 times daily.

#### **Children:**

- Dosage should be individualized based on the child's age, weight, and the severity of the infection. Consult pediatric dosing guidelines or a pediatric specialist.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Close monitoring of renal function is recommended. Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustment based on creatinine clearance or serum gentamicin levels is crucial.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** While hepatic metabolism of gentamicin is minimal, caution is advised in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Monitor renal function.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific adjustments are routinely recommended, but close monitoring for potential drug interactions is essential.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  
Dosage is generally the same as the standard dosage, but specific contexts may warrant modification:

- **Intubation:** Prophylactic use is not typically indicated.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Can be used pre- or post-operatively for ophthalmic procedures.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** No specific dosage adjustment; monitor closely for superinfection.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Standard dosing applies; close renal function monitoring is essential, especially with concomitant nephrotoxic agents.
- **Emergency Situations:** Not typically indicated for systemic emergencies.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Renal function should be assessed prior to and during therapy. Modifications are necessary based on creatinine clearance or serum gentamicin levels, especially in renal impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Ocular: Transient burning, stinging, irritation, blurred vision, itching, redness, tearing, sticky eyelashes, foreign body sensation.
- Otologic:  Discomfort, itching.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage).
- Ototoxicity (hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo).
- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, anaphylaxis).


### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Development of resistant bacterial strains.
- Increased risk of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, especially in patients with renal impairment.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Anaphylaxis (rare but serious).
- Neuromuscular blockade (rare).



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to gentamicin or other aminoglycosides.
- Pre-existing hearing loss or vestibular dysfunction (relative contraindication).
- Viral or fungal eye infections.
- Perforated tympanic membrane (for ear use).


## **Drug Interactions**

- Other nephrotoxic or ototoxic drugs (e.g., amphotericin B, vancomycin, loop diuretics) increase the risk of adverse effects.
- Neuromuscular blocking agents potentiate gentamicin's effects.
- Some antiviral medications (e.g. Atazanavir, Amprenavir, Indinavir) may interact.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Gentamicin is classified as Pregnancy Category C/D. Avoid use unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.
- **Breastfeeding:** Gentamicin is present in breast milk in low concentrations. Monitor infants for diarrhea, thrush, or other adverse effects.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Gentamicin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis; HPMC lubricates.
- **Side Effects:** Ocular irritation, ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to aminoglycosides, pre-existing hearing loss, viral/fungal infections.
- **Drug Interactions:** Other nephrotoxic/ototoxic agents, neuromuscular blocking agents.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; potential fetal risk.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 1-2 drops every 4-6 hours; children: individualized dosing.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, hearing, vestibular function.

## **Popular Combinations**

Gentamicin is sometimes combined with corticosteroids for synergistic effects in treating inflammatory conditions with a bacterial component.  


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess renal function before initiating therapy and monitor regularly during therapy. Monitor for ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Avoid prolonged use.  Ensure proper administration technique to prevent contamination.  Do not touch the tip of the dropper to any surface.
- **Specific Populations:**  Pregnant Women:  Assess risks and benefits carefully. Breastfeeding Mothers: Monitor infant for side effects.  Children & Elderly:  Adjust dosage as needed.
