## **Usage**

This combination is primarily prescribed as a nutritional supplement to improve cognitive function. It is used for conditions like memory problems, dementia (including Alzheimer's disease), anxiety, depression, and dizziness (vertigo).  It is also prescribed for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.  It's important to note that the efficacy of this combination for these conditions is not definitively established and is still under investigation.  The pharmacological classifications for the individual components are: Ginkgo Biloba (herbal/antioxidant), Methylcobalamin (vitamin/neurotrophic), Piracetam (nootropic).

## **Alternate Names**

Ginkoba M; Ginkgo + B12, Neuromin-M.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Ginkgo Biloba:** Acts as an antioxidant and improves blood circulation, particularly in the brain.
* **Methylcobalamin:**  A form of vitamin B12 essential for nerve cell function, myelin production, and red blood cell formation. It may help rejuvenate damaged nerve cells.
* **Piracetam:**  A nootropic that is thought to protect the brain from hypoxia and modulate nerve cell channels, potentially influencing cognitive processes.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  All three components are generally well-absorbed after oral administration.
* **Metabolism & Elimination:**  The exact metabolic pathways for this combination are complex and not fully elucidated. Piracetam is primarily excreted renally largely unchanged. Methylcobalamin is metabolized and stored in the liver. Ginkgo Biloba metabolism is complex, with multiple metabolites excreted through both renal and hepatic pathways.  

**Mode of Action:** The combination is thought to work synergistically by improving cerebral blood flow, protecting neurons from oxidative stress, and enhancing neuronal function.  However, the precise molecular mechanisms are not fully understood.


## **Dosage**

Dosage information for this specific combination is limited.  Dosage recommendations should be individualized and based on the patient's specific condition and response to therapy.  Always follow medical advice.

### **Standard Dosage**
