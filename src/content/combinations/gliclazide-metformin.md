## **Usage**

Gliclazide + Metformin is prescribed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults, specifically when diet and exercise alone do not adequately control blood glucose levels.  This combination therapy is particularly useful when metformin monotherapy is insufficient or not tolerated.  It falls under the pharmacological classification of **oral antihyperglycemic agents**, specifically combining a **sulfonylurea** (gliclazide) with a **biguanide** (metformin).

Gliclazide works primarily by stimulating insulin release from the pancreas. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Gliclazide + Metformin" represents the generic name, various brand names exist depending on the region and manufacturer. One example is **K-GEM**.  There are no widely recognized international variations for the combined formulation's name. However, individual components might have regional variations.


## **How It Works**

**Gliclazide:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:**  Gliclazide stimulates insulin secretion by binding to sulfonylurea receptors (SUR1) on pancreatic beta cells, closing ATP-sensitive potassium channels, leading to membrane depolarization and calcium influx. This triggers insulin exocytosis. It also improves peripheral insulin sensitivity and reduces microthrombotic events.
* **Pharmacokinetics:**  Gliclazide is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentration in 4-6 hours (immediate release) or displays sustained levels with modified-release formulations. It is highly protein-bound and extensively metabolized in the liver, with primarily renal excretion of inactive metabolites.

**Metformin:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Metformin's primary action is reducing hepatic glucose production.  It also increases peripheral glucose uptake and utilization and decreases intestinal glucose absorption.  It does not stimulate insulin secretion.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Metformin is absorbed slowly and incompletely from the gastrointestinal tract.  It is not metabolized in the liver and is excreted unchanged primarily by the kidneys.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**  
#### **Adults:**  

Gliclazide: Initial dose is usually 30-40 mg daily (immediate release or modified release), adjusted according to blood glucose response up to a maximum of 320 mg for immediate release or 120 mg for modified release.  Doses above 160 mg (immediate release) should be divided into two doses.

Metformin: Initial dose is typically 500 mg twice daily or 850 mg once daily, taken with meals.  The dose can be titrated upwards, not exceeding 2550 mg daily, divided into 2-3 doses.  Extended-release formulations allow once-daily administration up to a maximum of 2000 mg.


#### **Children:**  

The combined formulation is not typically used in children. Metformin is approved for use in children 10 years and older.


#### **Special Cases:**  

* **Elderly Patients**: Start at lower doses and titrate cautiously.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Gliclazide can be used with caution and dosage reduction.  Metformin is contraindicated with an eGFR <30 ml/min, not recommended to initiate if eGFR 30-45 mL/min, and dosage reduction is recommended if eGFR is 45-60 ml/min.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Metformin is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.  Gliclazide should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Dosage adjustments might be necessary depending on the specific comorbid conditions.





### **Clinical Use Cases**  

The Gliclazide + Metformin combination is not indicated for use in acute settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**  

Dosage adjustments should be individualized based on the patient's blood glucose response, renal function, hepatic function, and any comorbid conditions.
