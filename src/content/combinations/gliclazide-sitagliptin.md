## **Usage**

Gliclazide + Sitagliptin is prescribed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults, specifically when diet and exercise alone, or in combination with metformin, do not provide adequate glycemic control.  This combination therapy is not indicated for type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.

It falls under the pharmacological classification of **antidiabetic agents**, specifically combining a **sulfonylurea** (gliclazide) and a **dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor** (sitagliptin).

Gliclazide works by stimulating insulin release from the pancreas. Sitagliptin works by increasing incretin levels, which in turn increase insulin release and decrease glucagon secretion. This combined approach helps to lower blood sugar levels.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no single international nonproprietary name (INN) for the combination of gliclazide and sitagliptin. It is often referred to by the names of its individual components.

**Brand names** may vary depending on the region of use.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics**: Gliclazide acts on ATP-sensitive potassium channels in pancreatic beta cells, stimulating insulin release. Sitagliptin inhibits the DPP-4 enzyme, increasing the levels of incretin hormones like GLP-1 and GIP. These hormones enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppress glucagon secretion.


**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Gliclazide:** Almost completely absorbed after oral administration.  Metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted mainly through the kidneys.
* **Sitagliptin:** Well absorbed after oral administration. Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine with a small fraction metabolized by CYP3A4, predominantly to its inactive metabolite.


**Mode of Action**: Gliclazide binds to sulfonylurea receptors on pancreatic beta cells, closing ATP-sensitive potassium channels. This depolarizes the cell membrane, leading to calcium influx and subsequent insulin release. Sitagliptin inhibits DPP-4, preventing the breakdown of incretins. This increases incretin levels, leading to enhanced glucose-dependent insulin release and suppressed glucagon secretion.


**Elimination Pathways**:  Gliclazide is metabolized by the liver and eliminated by the kidney. Sitagliptin is mainly excreted unchanged in urine.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  The dosage is individualized based on the patient's current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability. It is often initiated as 50mg sitagliptin + 80mg gliclazide daily.  Sitagliptin is generally administered once a day. Gliclazide can be administered once or twice daily based on formulation and patient response. 


#### **Children**:  The use of gliclazide + sitagliptin is not recommended in children.  Safety and efficacy have not been established.

#### **Special Cases**:

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary due to age-related decline in renal function. Start with a low dose and titrate carefully.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction of sitagliptin is recommended.  Gliclazide use needs to be carefully considered.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments may be required for gliclazide.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Dosage should be individualized.



### **Clinical Use Cases**: The listed clinical use cases (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, Emergency Situations) are not directly relevant to the prescribing information for gliclazide + sitagliptin.

### **Dosage Adjustments**:  Dose adjustments may be necessary based on renal function, hepatic function, and concomitant medications.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**: Hypoglycemia, headache, nausea, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**:  Pancreatitis, severe allergic reactions (including angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome),  bullous pemphigoid, acute renal failure.


### **Long-Term Effects**:  Potential long-term effects include chronic complications of diabetes if blood sugar is not adequately controlled.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**:  The serious side effects mentioned above would qualify as clinically significant ADRs.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to gliclazide, sitagliptin, or any component of the formulation.
* Type 1 diabetes mellitus.
* Diabetic ketoacidosis.
* Severe renal impairment.
* History of pancreatitis (especially with DPP-4 inhibitors).
* Severe hepatic impairment (gliclazide).



## **Drug Interactions**

Gliclazide and sitagliptin can interact with various medications. Some notable interactions include:

* **CYP3A4 Inhibitors/Inducers:**  May affect sitagliptin metabolism.
* **Sulfonylureas/Insulin:** Increased risk of hypoglycemia when combined.
* **Other Antidiabetic Agents**: Close monitoring required due to potential additive hypoglycemic effects.
* **Alcohol**: Increased risk of hypoglycemia.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Gliclazide is contraindicated during pregnancy. Sitagliptin has limited human data, but animal studies suggest a low risk. Due to potential risks, alternative therapies are generally preferred during pregnancy and breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Gliclazide: Stimulates insulin release.  Sitagliptin: Increases incretin levels.
* **Side Effects:** Hypoglycemia, headache, nausea, pancreatitis (rare), allergic reactions (rare).
* **Contraindications:** Type 1 diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis, severe renal impairment, hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:**  CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers, other antidiabetic agents, alcohol.
