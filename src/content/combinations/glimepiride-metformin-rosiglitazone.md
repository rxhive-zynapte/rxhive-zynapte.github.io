## **Usage**

- This combination drug is prescribed for **Type 2 diabetes mellitus** in adults when diet and exercise alone do not provide adequate glycemic control.  It is not indicated for Type 1 diabetes.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antidiabetic agent, combining three different classes:
    - Glimepiride: Sulfonylurea
    - Metformin: Biguanide
    - Rosiglitazone: Thiazolidinedione
- **Mechanism of Action:** This triple combination works synergistically to lower blood glucose levels through different mechanisms:
    - Glimepiride: Stimulates insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells.
    - Metformin: Decreases hepatic glucose production, reduces intestinal glucose absorption, and improves insulin sensitivity.
    - Rosiglitazone: Increases insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues (muscle, fat) by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ).

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names for this specific combination exist.  The components may be known by different names internationally.
- **Brand Names:** This specific triple combination is not available as a single branded product. However, dual combinations exist, such as Avandamet (rosiglitazone + metformin) and Avandaryl (rosiglitazone + glimepiride). Each component is also available as individual generic medications and under various brand names.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**
    - Glimepiride binds to sulfonylurea receptors on pancreatic beta-cells, closing ATP-sensitive potassium channels. This depolarizes the cell, opening voltage-gated calcium channels, which leads to an influx of calcium and triggers insulin release.
    - Metformin activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), leading to reduced hepatic gluconeogenesis, increased glucose uptake in peripheral tissues, and improved insulin signaling.  The exact mechanism is not fully understood.
    - Rosiglitazone binds to and activates PPARγ, a nuclear receptor that regulates gene transcription involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. This results in increased insulin sensitivity in muscle and adipose tissue, enhanced glucose uptake, and improved insulin action.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Glimepiride:  Well-absorbed orally, highly protein-bound, metabolized by the liver (CYP2C9), and excreted primarily in urine and bile.
    - Metformin: Absorbed from the gut, not metabolized by the liver, and excreted unchanged by the kidneys.
    - Rosiglitazone:  Extensively metabolized in the liver (primarily CYP2C8), with small amounts excreted in urine and feces.

- **Elimination Pathways:**
    - Glimepiride: Renal and hepatic.
    - Metformin: Renal.
    - Rosiglitazone: Hepatic (CYP2C8) with minor renal and fecal excretion.


## **Dosage**

The triple combination of glimepiride, metformin, and rosiglitazone is not available as a single fixed-dose combination product.  Therefore, individual components are prescribed and titrated based on patient-specific needs.  Dosage guidance below pertains to each drug separately:

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Glimepiride:** Initial: 1 mg orally once daily with breakfast or the first main meal.  Maintenance: 1-4 mg once daily; maximum 8 mg/day.
- **Metformin:** Initial: 500 mg orally twice daily or 850 mg once daily with meals.  Maintenance: 1500-2550 mg/day in divided doses; maximum 2550 mg/day.
- **Rosiglitazone:** Initial: 4 mg orally once daily or 2 mg twice daily.  Maintenance: 4-8 mg daily as a single dose or in two divided doses.

#### **Children:**

- This combination is not recommended for pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate therapy at lower doses and titrate cautiously due to potential age-related decline in renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Metformin is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²).  Glimepiride and rosiglitazone may require dose adjustments.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Rosiglitazone should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment and is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.  Glimepiride dosage may require adjustment. Metformin is generally safe in mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction but should be used with caution.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary in patients with heart failure (rosiglitazone should be avoided), and other conditions.



### **Clinical Use Cases**  The dosages for specific clinical use cases would depend on the individual patient's needs and how well their diabetes is controlled.

### **Dosage Adjustments**  Dose modifications should be based on blood sugar levels and potential side effects.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Hypoglycemia
- Headache
- Nausea
- Diarrhea
- Weight gain

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Increased risk of fractures (rosiglitazone)
- Weight gain
- Cardiovascular events


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Myocardial ischemia


## **Contraindications**

- Type 1 diabetes
- Diabetic ketoacidosis
- Severe renal impairment (metformin)
- Severe hepatic impairment (rosiglitazone)

## **Drug Interactions**

- Many drug interactions can occur with this combination. Some important ones include:
    - Insulin and other antidiabetic agents: Increased risk of hypoglycemia.
    - Gemfibrozil (CYP2C8 inhibitor): Increased rosiglitazone levels.
    - Rifampin (CYP2C8 inducer): Decreased rosiglitazone levels.
    - Cationic drugs (e.g., amiloride, digoxin):  Increased metformin levels.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** This combination should be avoided during pregnancy. Insulin is the preferred agent for managing diabetes during pregnancy.
- **Breastfeeding:** It is unknown if these drugs are excreted in breast milk. The combination is generally not recommended during breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary** (see above for details)


## **Popular Combinations**

- This specific triple therapy is not a routinely prescribed combination. More typically, metformin is combined with either a sulfonylurea like glimepiride OR a thiazolidinedione like rosiglitazone.
