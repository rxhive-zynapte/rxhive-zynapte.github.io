## **Usage**

- This triple combination therapy is prescribed for **type 2 diabetes mellitus** in adults when other dual therapies, like metformin plus glimepiride, or metformin plus sitagliptin, do not adequately control blood sugar levels.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antidiabetic combination, including a biguanide (metformin), a sulfonylurea (glimepiride), and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor (sitagliptin).
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination targets multiple pathways involved in glucose regulation. Glimepiride stimulates insulin release from the pancreas. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, reduces intestinal glucose absorption, and improves insulin sensitivity. Sitagliptin prolongs the action of incretin hormones, which increase insulin release and decrease glucagon secretion, particularly after meals.


## **Alternate Names**

- No internationally recognized non-proprietary name exists for this specific three-drug combination.  It is often referred to by its constituent drugs.
- **Brand Names:** This combination might be available under various brand names depending on the manufacturer and the specific region/country. It is crucial to confirm the composition using the International Nonproprietary Names (INNs) - Glimepiride, Metformin, and Sitagliptin.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The combined effect of the three drugs results in a synergistic reduction in blood glucose levels. Glimepiride increases insulin secretion, while metformin and sitagliptin improve insulin utilization and suppress glucagon.  
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Glimepiride:** Well absorbed orally, metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP2C9, and eliminated through both renal and biliary pathways.
    - **Metformin:** Absorbed from the small intestine, not metabolized in the liver, and excreted unchanged by the kidneys.
    - **Sitagliptin:** Absorbed orally, partially metabolized by CYP3A4, with the majority excreted unchanged in urine.
- **Mode of Action:**
    - **Glimepiride:** Binds to sulfonylurea receptors on pancreatic beta cells, closing ATP-sensitive potassium channels, leading to membrane depolarization and calcium influx, triggering insulin release.
    - **Metformin:** Activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibiting gluconeogenesis in the liver. It also improves peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.
    - **Sitagliptin:** Inhibits the enzyme DPP-4, preventing the breakdown of incretin hormones like GLP-1 and GIP. These hormones enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppress glucagon release.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Glimepiride undergoes hepatic metabolism (CYP2C9) with renal and biliary excretion. Metformin is renally excreted.  Sitagliptin is mainly renally excreted with some hepatic metabolism (CYP3A4).


## **Dosage**

Dosage should be individualized based on patient needs, current treatment regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability.


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The dosage is individualized, based on the patient's current regimen, starting with lower doses of each component and titrating upwards based on efficacy and tolerability.  The maximum recommended daily dose is 8 mg glimepiride, 2000 mg metformin, and 100 mg sitagliptin.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses due to potential age-related decline in renal function. Careful titration and close monitoring are necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²).  Dose adjustments are required based on eGFR. Metformin is contraindicated in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, and should be temporarily discontinued if renal function declines.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Glimepiride is not recommended in severe hepatic impairment. Metformin should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment due to an increased risk of lactic acidosis. Sitagliptin dosage adjustment may be required in severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Carefully consider comorbid conditions, especially cardiovascular disease, as these may impact drug selection and dosage.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This specific combination is generally not indicated for use in acute settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU. It is intended for long-term management of type 2 diabetes. Insulin therapy is often preferred in these acute clinical settings.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary based on patient-specific factors like renal function, hepatic function, and concomitant medications. Regular monitoring of renal function and blood glucose is essential.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Hypoglycemia
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
- Headache
- Upper respiratory tract infection


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Lactic acidosis (metformin)
- Pancreatitis
- Severe allergic reactions (angioedema, anaphylaxis)


### **Long-Term Effects**

- Vitamin B12 deficiency (metformin)


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, pancreatitis, severe allergic reactions.



## **Contraindications**

- Type 1 diabetes
- Diabetic ketoacidosis
- Severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²)

- Hypersensitivity to any component of the combination



## **Drug Interactions**

- Alcohol (increased risk of lactic acidosis with metformin, hypoglycemia with glimepiride)
- Medications that affect renal function (may increase metformin levels)
- Cimetidine (increases metformin levels)
- Beta-blockers (may mask symptoms of hypoglycemia)
- Sulfonamide antibiotics (may potentiate the hypoglycemic effect of glimepiride)
- CYP2C9 inhibitors (may increase glimepiride levels)
- CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors (may affect sitagliptin levels)



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** This combination is not recommended during pregnancy. Insulin is generally preferred for managing diabetes in pregnant women.
- **Breastfeeding:** Metformin is excreted in breast milk, and the safety of sitagliptin and glimepiride during breastfeeding is not well-established. Alternative therapies may be considered.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Combined effects of insulin secretagogue, insulin sensitizer, and incretin enhancer.
- **Side Effects:** Hypoglycemia, GI issues, headache, lactic acidosis (rare), pancreatitis (rare).
- **Contraindications:** Type 1 diabetes, ketoacidosis, severe renal/hepatic disease, hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:** Alcohol, renal function altering drugs, cimetidine, beta-blockers, certain antibiotics.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Not recommended.
- **Dosage:** Individualized based on patient needs and tolerability, up to 8 mg glimepiride, 2000 mg metformin, and 100 mg sitagliptin daily.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood glucose, HbA1c, renal function (eGFR), and signs of adverse effects.


## **Popular Combinations**

While this triple combination itself is a popular approach when dual therapies fail, it is not typically combined with other oral antidiabetic agents. However, in some cases, insulin may be added if the combination does not achieve adequate glycemic control.


## **Precautions**

- Renal and hepatic function monitoring.
- Monitor for signs of hypoglycemia.
- Adjust dose in elderly patients and those with renal impairment.
- Avoid excessive alcohol intake.
