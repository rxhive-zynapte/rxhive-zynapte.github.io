## **Usage**

Glimepiride + Rosiglitazone is prescribed for type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control. It is specifically indicated for patients who have not achieved adequate glycemic control with either glimepiride or rosiglitazone alone, or in those transitioning from separate glimepiride and rosiglitazone tablets. It is not for treating type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis, and it's not recommended to be used with insulin or nitrates.

This combination drug falls under the pharmacological classification of oral antidiabetic agents, comprising a thiazolidinedione (rosiglitazone) and a sulfonylurea (glimepiride).

Glimepiride stimulates the release of insulin from pancreatic beta-cells, while rosiglitazone enhances insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues like adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and the liver. This dual mechanism helps improve blood glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

## **Alternate Names**

Glimepiride + Rosiglitazone doesn't have alternate names but is known under the brand name Avandaryl.  The brand name Avandaryl has been discontinued in some countries like the United States.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Rosiglitazone primarily acts as a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist, increasing insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. Glimepiride works by binding to and closing ATP-sensitive potassium channels in pancreatic beta-cells, leading to depolarization and subsequent insulin release.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Both drugs are administered orally. Rosiglitazone is well-absorbed and extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2C8 and to some extent by CYP2C9. Glimepiride is also well-absorbed, extensively metabolized in the liver (primarily via CYP2C9), and excreted mainly through the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** Rosiglitazone increases target cell response to insulin, while glimepiride promotes insulin secretion. This combination addresses both insulin resistance and deficient insulin production common in type 2 diabetes.

**Elimination:** Glimepiride is primarily eliminated through the kidneys. Rosiglitazone is mainly metabolized in the liver by CYP2C8, with some contribution from CYP2C9, and then excreted via bile and urine.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Initial dose: 4 mg rosiglitazone / 1 mg glimepiride or 4 mg rosiglitazone / 2 mg glimepiride once daily with the first meal.
For patients switching from separate tablets: Same dose as previously taken.
Titration: Glimepiride can be increased by a maximum of 2 mg every 1-2 weeks if needed, while rosiglitazone can be increased after 8-12 weeks if required.
Maximum dose: 8 mg rosiglitazone / 4 mg glimepiride once daily.

#### **Children:**

The use of Glimepiride + Rosiglitazone is not recommended in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient safety and efficacy data.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose (4 mg/1 mg) and titrate carefully due to increased susceptibility to hypoglycemia and potential age-related kidney problems.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  For mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 80 mL/min), careful dosing is required, and close monitoring is advised for hypoglycemia. For severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min), this combination is contraindicated.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with heart failure, heart disease or history of heart attack, edema, osteoporosis, and liver disease.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of Glimepiride + Rosiglitazone is not indicated in acute clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use. It's intended for long-term management of type 2 diabetes through chronic oral administration and is not suitable for emergency situations like cardiac arrest or status epilepticus.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on individual glycemic response and tolerability. Renal function should be assessed, particularly in the elderly, and hepatic function should be evaluated before starting therapy. Adjust dose cautiously for patients with renal impairment.
