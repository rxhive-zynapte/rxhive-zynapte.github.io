## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to support liver health and function, and to address nutritional deficiencies. It may be prescribed for conditions such as alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, and toxin-induced liver damage.  It's also used to support overall well-being, particularly when dietary intake alone is insufficient. While not strictly fitting a single pharmacological classification, it possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hepatoprotective properties.  It is not considered a medication but may be recommended alongside liver health maintenance and treatment regimens.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is generally referred to by its constituent ingredients. Some brand names under which similar combinations might be marketed include Livolexin, Symo Liv, and others. The exact composition and brand names can vary depending on the manufacturer.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Glutathione:** A potent antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative damage, contributing to detoxification processes within the liver.
* **Lecithin:** Supports liver function, aids in cholesterol reduction and acts as an emulsifying agent for facilitating the absorption of other nutrients.
* **Silymarin:** Derived from milk thistle, this flavonoid complex displays antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic properties that protect liver cells and promote regeneration.
* **Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine):** Essential for various metabolic processes, including amino acid metabolism, supporting optimal liver function and providing various nutritional benefits.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** The components are absorbed through the digestive system. Taking the supplement with food can enhance absorption and reduce the risk of gastrointestinal upset.
* **Metabolism:** Each component undergoes its own metabolic pathway within the liver, transformed into active forms for utilization. 
* **Elimination:** Metabolites are primarily excreted through urine, with some elimination via bile.

**Mode of Action:**

* **Antioxidant effects:** Glutathione and silymarin neutralize free radicals, preventing oxidative damage to liver cells and tissues.
* **Anti-inflammatory effects:** Silymarin inhibits inflammatory mediators within the liver.
* **Antifibrotic effects:** Silymarin inhibits the formation of excess fibrous connective tissue in the liver and helps regenerate liver tissues.
* **Metabolic support:** Vitamin B6 plays a crucial role in various metabolic pathways, supporting optimal liver function.
* **Cell membrane stabilization:**  Silymarin and lecithin helps stabilize liver cell membranes, protecting against toxins.

## **Dosage**

Dosage recommendations are typically based on the specific product formulation and the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

A typical dose might involve taking one capsule or a specific amount of syrup once or twice daily. However, it's crucial to follow the manufacturer's or physician's prescribed dose and instructions.
