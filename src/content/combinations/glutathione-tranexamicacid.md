## **Usage**

This combination is primarily used for skin lightening and brightening, addressing concerns like melasma, hyperpigmentation, and uneven skin tone.  It is also promoted for anti-aging benefits, reducing wrinkles and fine lines.  It falls under the pharmacological classifications of antioxidant, antifibrinolytic (Tranexamic acid), and skin lightening agent.

Tranexamic acid works by inhibiting plasminogen activation, which reduces the formation of plasmin, an enzyme involved in the breakdown of fibrin clots. This action helps control bleeding and may also affect melanin synthesis pathways, leading to a reduction in hyperpigmentation. Glutathione acts as an antioxidant and is believed to inhibit tyrosinase, an enzyme involved in melanin production. Ascorbic Acid (vitamin C), often included in formulations with this combination, further contributes to antioxidant effects and skin brightening.

## **Alternate Names**

This specific combination doesn't have a universally recognized alternate name. However, the individual components are sometimes referred to as:

* **Glutathione:**  Reduced L-Glutathione, GSH
* **Tranexamic Acid:** TXA
* **Ascorbic acid:**  Vitamin C

Brand names containing this combination vary. One example found in the source material is Tenxima 3D Glow.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Tranexamic acid exerts its antifibrinolytic effect by reversibly binding to plasminogen, preventing its conversion to plasmin and subsequent fibrinolysis. This primarily affects bleeding control. Its effects on melanogenesis are thought to be related to the inhibition of plasminogen activator, which may influence melanocyte activity. Glutathione primarily functions as an antioxidant, scavenging free radicals. Its role in skin lightening is attributed to tyrosinase inhibition, interfering with melanin production. Ascorbic acid similarly acts as an antioxidant and can also inhibit melanin synthesis.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Glutathione:**  Oral bioavailability is low. Intravenous administration achieves higher systemic levels.  Metabolism and elimination pathways are not fully elucidated, but it is thought to undergo breakdown in the liver.
* **Tranexamic Acid:** Well-absorbed orally.  Peak plasma levels are achieved in about 3 hours. Mostly excreted unchanged in urine via glomerular filtration.  The half-life is approximately 2-3 hours. 
* **Ascorbic Acid:** Readily absorbed from the gut. Excess is excreted in urine.

**Mode of Action (Cellular/Molecular):**

* **Tranexamic Acid:** Binds to the lysine-binding sites of plasminogen, preventing its interaction with fibrin.  May also indirectly affect melanocyte activity through plasminogen activator inhibition.
* **Glutathione:** Acts as a substrate for glutathione peroxidase, neutralizing free radicals.  May inhibit tyrosinase by interacting with copper ions at the enzyme's active site. 
* **Ascorbic acid:** Donates electrons to neutralize free radicals. Can reduce oxidized forms of melanin, contributing to lightening effects.


## **Dosage**

Dosage information for this combination is limited in the provided sources.  Information below is derived from the sources, focusing on the individual components as their combination use is not well documented. Dosage recommendations may vary based on product formulation (oral, topical, intravenous) and intended use. Consulting a qualified healthcare professional is crucial for determining appropriate dosage and administration.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  The typical recommendation found for oral supplements containing this combination is one tablet or capsule daily, ideally taken with a meal. Topical creams with glutathione, tranexamic acid, and/or ascorbic acid are available in various concentrations, and application frequency depends on the specific product and the patient's skin sensitivity.

#### **Children:** Pediatric dosing for this specific combination is not well-defined.  Use in children should be under the guidance of a pediatrician.

#### **Special Cases:**

Dosage adjustments should be made in consultation with a physician. For tranexamic acid specifically, dose reductions are advised for patients with renal impairment.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources do not detail specific dosages for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, or ICU settings. Tranexamic acid alone has established uses in certain surgical scenarios to control bleeding, but its combined use with glutathione and ascorbic acid in these contexts is not documented in the provided information.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are necessary based on individual responses and specific skin concerns. Consultation with a healthcare provider is essential. Tranexamic acid requires dose adjustments for patients with renal impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Gastrointestinal issues (mild stomach discomfort, nausea, diarrhea)
* Skin reactions (redness, rash, itching, dryness)
* Headache

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Allergic reactions
* Thrombotic events (with tranexamic acid)
* Visual disturbances (with tranexamic acid)


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation
* History of thromboembolic events (for tranexamic acid)


## **Drug Interactions**

Limited specific interaction information is available for this combination. Tranexamic acid may interact with hormonal contraceptives and some clotting factors. Glutathione may theoretically interact with certain chemotherapeutic agents. It is important to disclose all medications and supplements being used to a physician.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not well-established. Consult a physician before use.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Antioxidant, antifibrinolytic, tyrosinase inhibition
* **Side Effects:** Gastrointestinal issues, skin reactions, headache, rare thrombotic events or visual disturbances
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, history of thromboembolic events
* **Drug Interactions:** Limited specific data, potential interactions with hormonal contraceptives, clotting factors, some chemotherapeutic agents
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Safety not well-established, consult a physician.



## **Popular Combinations**

Often combined with other antioxidants or skin-lightening agents like niacinamide.


## **Precautions**

Start with a lower frequency of use or concentration for topical formulations and gradually increase as tolerated. Monitor for any adverse reactions.
