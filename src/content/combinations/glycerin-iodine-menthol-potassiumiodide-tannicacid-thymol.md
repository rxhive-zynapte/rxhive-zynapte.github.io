## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for various **dental and oral conditions**, including gingivitis (gum inflammation), bleeding gums, periodontitis (inflammation of the supporting tissues of the teeth), post-extraction pain, denture irritation, hypersensitive teeth, toothaches, painful gums, stomatitis (inflammation of the mouth and lips), and throat irritation.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antiseptic, astringent, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and deodorant.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  The components work synergistically to provide comprehensive oral care. Iodine and Potassium Iodide act as antiseptics, killing bacteria and fungi. Tannic acid is an astringent, shrinking and tightening tissues to reduce inflammation and bleeding. Menthol and Thymol provide analgesic and mild anesthetic effects, relieving pain and discomfort. Glycerin acts as a demulcent, soothing irritated tissues.

## **Alternate Names**

- This specific combination does not have a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN). It is often referred to by the names of its individual components.
- **Brand Names:**  Various brand names exist for products containing this combination, depending on the manufacturer and specific formulation, including  Gumex, Sensoform, Dantox, and Microdent, among others.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The combined effects of the ingredients result in antiseptic action against oral pathogens, reduced inflammation and bleeding of gums, pain relief, and a soothing effect on the oral mucosa.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily applied topically, the absorption of these components through the oral mucosa is limited.  Iodine and Potassium Iodide can be absorbed to some extent, with iodine being metabolized in the thyroid gland and excreted in urine.  Other components are mostly metabolized locally or swallowed with saliva and undergo gastrointestinal processing. The exact metabolic pathways and elimination routes for all components in this topical application are not fully characterized.
- **Mode of Action:** Iodine exerts its antiseptic effect through halogenation, disrupting microbial cell walls and inhibiting protein synthesis.  Tannic acid precipitates proteins, forming a protective layer and reducing inflammation. Menthol and Thymol activate TRPM8 receptors, producing a cooling sensation and analgesic effects.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily via saliva and subsequently gastrointestinal processing. Some iodine absorption can lead to urinary excretion.


## **Dosage**

The dosage varies depending on the product formulation and the specific condition being treated. Always follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer or the prescribing physician.
