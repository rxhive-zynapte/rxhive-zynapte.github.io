## **Usage**

- Glycerin + Mannitol is prescribed for the treatment of cerebral edema (brain swelling) and raised intracranial pressure (ICP). It is also used to reduce elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and can be employed in the prevention and treatment of the oliguric phase of acute renal failure.  
- **Pharmacological classification:** Osmotic diuretic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination exerts its effect by increasing the osmotic pressure of plasma, drawing fluid out of the brain and eyes into the vascular compartment. This subsequently increases urine production, leading to reduced ICP and IOP.

## **Alternate Names**

- Glycerol + Mannitol
- **Brand Names:**  Neurotol, Critol-G (Note: Brand names can vary regionally.  This list may not be exhaustive.)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Glycerin and mannitol create an osmotic gradient across the blood-brain barrier and the blood-aqueous barrier, leading to fluid shifts from the brain and eyes into the plasma.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Both drugs are administered intravenously.  Mannitol is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Glycerin can be metabolized in the liver or excreted unchanged by the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:** Osmotic gradient creation.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**  Not applicable.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for both, with some hepatic metabolism for glycerin.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Cerebral Edema/Raised ICP:** 1-2 g/kg  of mannitol combined with an equal dose of glycerin, infused intravenously over 30-60 minutes. This can be repeated every 6-8 hours as needed.
- **Elevated Intraocular Pressure:** 1.5-2 g/kg of mannitol combined with an equal dose of glycerin, infused intravenously over 30-60 minutes. Preoperatively, administer 1-1.5 hours before surgery.


#### **Children:**

- **Cerebral Edema/Raised ICP:** 0.5-1 g/kg of each drug infused over 30-60 minutes. (For severe encephalopathies, such as Reye syndrome, 20% solutions of each drug at 0.5-1.0 g/kg may be used).
- **Elevated IOP:** 1.5-2 g/kg of a 20% solution of mannitol with an equivalent glycerin dose infused over 30-60 minutes.
- **Pediatric Safety Considerations:** Close monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance is crucial in children due to their higher susceptibility to dehydration and electrolyte disturbances.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Close monitoring for fluid and electrolyte imbalances, and renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are usually necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised with Glycerin due to its potential hepatic metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is essential for patients with cardiac conditions or diabetes.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation:** Can be used to decrease ICP before intubation in patients with neurological conditions.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Employed to decrease IOP before ophthalmic surgery and to reduce ICP prior to neurosurgical procedures.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** May be used in mechanically ventilated patients with raised ICP.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Frequently administered for ICP management in ICU settings.
- **Emergency Situations:** Used for emergent reduction of ICP and IOP.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- Adjust based on patient response, serum osmolality, and renal function.
