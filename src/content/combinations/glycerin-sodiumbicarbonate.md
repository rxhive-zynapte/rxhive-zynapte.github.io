## **Usage**

Glycerin and sodium bicarbonate are frequently used in combination for earwax softening.  Sodium bicarbonate is also prescribed to treat metabolic acidosis and is sometimes used as an antacid. Glycerin, an osmotic laxative, can be used for constipation.

While they are often combined for earwax softening, they have different pharmacological classifications and mechanisms of action. Sodium bicarbonate is classified as an alkalinizing agent, while glycerin is classified as an osmotic laxative.

## **Alternate Names**

* **Glycerin:** Glycerol, propane-1,2,3-triol
* **Sodium Bicarbonate:** Baking soda, bicarbonate of soda, sodium hydrogen carbonate
* **Combination:** Soda Bicarb Glycerin Ear Drops (brand name example)

## **How It Works**

**Glycerin**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Glycerin exerts a hyperosmotic effect, drawing water into the bowel lumen, softening the stool and promoting peristalsis. In the ear, it softens and lubricates cerumen (earwax).
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Orally administered glycerin is partially absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; however, when administered rectally, its systemic absorption is negligible. Glycerin is metabolized primarily in the liver, with a small amount metabolized in the kidneys. It is eliminated through renal excretion.


**Sodium Bicarbonate**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Sodium bicarbonate acts as a systemic alkalinizing agent by increasing plasma bicarbonate, buffering excess hydrogen ion concentration, and raising blood pH.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Sodium bicarbonate is absorbed rapidly from the gastrointestinal tract. It is filtered by the kidneys and excreted in the urine, influencing acid-base balance.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

**Glycerin (Rectal)**

* **Adults:** One suppository (typically 4 grams or as directed) inserted rectally daily as needed.
* **Children (2–6 years):** Pediatric suppositories as directed by a physician.
* **Children (under 2 years):** Use only as directed by a physician.

**Glycerin (Otic)**

* **Adults and Children:** 3-4 drops in the affected ear(s), 3 to 4 times daily for 3 to 5 days, or as directed.

**Sodium Bicarbonate (Oral)**

* **Adults (Metabolic Acidosis):** 1–2 mEq/kg IV initially, followed by additional doses based on blood pH and clinical condition.
* **Adults (Antacid):** 325 mg to 2 grams, 1 to 4 times per day.

**Children (Metabolic Acidosis and Antacid):** Dosage must be determined by a doctor based on weight and condition.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  
Sodium bicarbonate is used in clinical settings like the ICU to treat metabolic acidosis and during cardiac arrest, particularly in cases involving hyperkalemia or tricyclic antidepressant overdose. Glycerin can be utilized preoperatively to reduce brain volume during certain neurosurgical procedures.  

### **Dosage Adjustments**  
Dosages for both medications should be adjusted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

## **Side Effects**

### **Glycerin**
* **Common:** Mild abdominal discomfort, bloating, flatulence, or rectal irritation.
* **Rare but Serious:**  Severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, rectal bleeding.

### **Sodium Bicarbonate**
* **Common:**  Flatulence, abdominal cramping, nausea, or edema.
* **Rare but Serious:** Metabolic alkalosis, hypernatremia, hypokalemia, tetany, seizures.

## **Contraindications**

### **Glycerin**
* Bowel obstruction, appendicitis, undiagnosed abdominal pain.

### **Sodium Bicarbonate**
* Metabolic alkalosis, hypocalcemia, hypernatremia, severe renal impairment.


## **Drug Interactions**

### **Glycerin**
Glycerin has few known drug interactions. However, concomitant use with other hyperosmotic agents may increase the risk of electrolyte imbalances.

### **Sodium Bicarbonate**
Sodium bicarbonate can interact with numerous medications, including certain antibiotics, diuretics, and cardiac glycosides.  It can also affect the absorption of some medications.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

### **Glycerin**
Glycerin is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but consult a physician before use.

### **Sodium Bicarbonate**
Limited data is available about the safety of sodium bicarbonate during pregnancy. It should be used only if the potential benefits justify the potential risks to the fetus. It is excreted in breast milk and may cause alkalosis in infants.


## **Drug Profile Summary**  
Please refer to the detailed sections above.

## **Popular Combinations**
 Glycerin is combined with sodium bicarbonate in ear drops for softening ear wax.

## **Precautions**
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment require close monitoring. Elderly individuals may be more sensitive to the effects of rectal laxatives. Glycerin suppositories should not be used for extended periods without medical advice.
