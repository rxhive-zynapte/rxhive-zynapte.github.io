## **Usage**

This drug combination isn't a recognized, standalone medication prescribed for specific medical conditions. Glycine and L-arginine are individually recognized amino acids with various uses, but their combined use in a single medication is not established.  Some studies suggest potential benefits of this combination for conditions like gastro-duodenal toxicity associated with NSAID use, primarily through reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. However, this is not a standard clinical practice.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no official alternate names for this combination. It is typically referred to as Glycine + L-Arginine or L-Arginine + Glycine. There are no popular brand names for this specific combination.

## **How It Works**

The combination's pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are not well-defined as a combined entity.  The effects are primarily derived from the individual actions of Glycine and L-arginine.


**Glycine:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:**  Acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, also involved in various metabolic processes.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, metabolized in the liver and kidneys, and excreted in urine.

**L-Arginine:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:**  A precursor to nitric oxide (NO), leading to vasodilation. It also stimulates the release of growth hormone, insulin, and other substances.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Absorbed in the small intestine, metabolized primarily in the liver by arginase, and excreted in urine.

**Combined effects:**  It is proposed that the combined effect of Glycine and L-Arginine is due to their individual roles in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. L-arginine's role as a nitric oxide precursor may improve blood flow, while glycine may have a protective effect on the gastrointestinal mucosa. Further research is needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms of their combined action.

## **Dosage**

There are no established dosage guidelines for the Glycine + L-Arginine combination as a recognized medication.  Dosing information below pertains to the individual components. Dosages for their combined use are not standardized and should be determined based on clinical trials and individual patient needs.

### **Standard Dosage**

No standard dosage exists for the combination as a therapy.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

There are no established clinical use cases for which this specific combination is indicated. The individual amino acids may be used for various clinical situations; however, the combination is not a standard treatment. 

### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific dosage adjustments are defined for the combination. For individual amino acids, adjustment is based on patient factors and comorbidities.

## **Side Effects**

The side effects of this combination are primarily based on those observed with each individual component.

### **Common Side Effects:**

* **L-Arginine:**  Bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, gout, allergic reactions, low blood pressure.
* **Glycine:** Generally well-tolerated, high doses may cause gastrointestinal discomfort.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* **L-Arginine:** Worsening of asthma symptoms,  potential increase in herpes outbreaks. There are concerns about increased mortality risk after a heart attack, especially in older adults, but more research is needed.

### **Long-Term Effects:**
Potential long-term effects of the combination are not yet studied.


## **Contraindications**

* **L-Arginine:** Recent heart attack, severe kidney disease, guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency (GAMT).
* **Glycine:** Generally safe, contraindications would be related to hypersensitivity.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **L-Arginine:** Nitrates, anticoagulants/antiplatelet medications, antihypertensive drugs, sildenafil (Viagra, Revatio), potassium-sparing diuretics, some blood sugar-lowering medications.
* **Glycine:**  Limited data, potentially cardiac glycosides.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Insufficient reliable data exists regarding the safety of combined Glycine and L-Arginine use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It's advisable to consult a healthcare professional before considering their use.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

As this is not an established drug, a summary is not applicable.
