## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Glycopyrrolate + Indacaterol is prescribed for the long-term, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  It is *not* indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm or for the treatment of asthma.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Bronchodilator combination (Long-acting muscarinic antagonist [LAMA] + Long-acting beta2-agonist [LABA]).
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination drug works by relaxing and widening the airways in the lungs. Indacaterol, the LABA component, stimulates beta2-adrenergic receptors in the lungs, leading to smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation. Glycopyrrolate, the LAMA component, blocks the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, further promoting bronchodilation and reducing mucus secretions.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:**  Glycopyrronium + Indacaterol (some regions).
- **Brand Names:** Utibron Neohaler速, Ultibro Breezhaler速, Seebri速 Neohaler (glycopyrrolate alone), Sequadra速.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Indacaterol acts as a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist, relaxing bronchial smooth muscle. Glycopyrrolate acts as a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (anticholinergic), inhibiting acetylcholine's effect on M1, M2, and M3 muscarinic receptors. This leads to reduced bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Indacaterol is rapidly absorbed after inhalation, reaching peak plasma concentration in about 15 minutes. Glycopyrrolate is poorly absorbed systemically after inhalation, with an absolute bioavailability of around 10-25% and peak concentration in approximately 5 minutes. This low systemic absorption limits its systemic anticholinergic effects while still providing bronchodilation.
    - **Metabolism:** Indacaterol is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Glycopyrrolate undergoes minimal metabolism.
    - **Elimination:** Indacaterol is mainly eliminated through feces, with a minor renal component. Glycopyrrolate is eliminated primarily unchanged in the urine.

- **Mode of Action:** Indacaterol binds to beta2-adrenergic receptors, activating intracellular signaling pathways leading to bronchial smooth muscle relaxation. Glycopyrrolate competitively inhibits acetylcholine binding to muscarinic receptors, preventing bronchoconstriction.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- One capsule (27.5 mcg indacaterol/15.6 mcg glycopyrrolate for Utibron Neohaler or 110 mcg indacaterol/50 mcg glycopyrrolate for Ultibro Breezhaler) inhaled twice daily (morning and evening) or one capsule (110/50mcg Ultibro Breezhaler) once daily, using the Neohaler or Breezhaler device, respectively. Do not swallow the capsules.

#### **Children:**

- Use is *not* recommended in pediatric patients. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is generally required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary for mild to moderate impairment. Caution is advised in severe renal impairment and end-stage renal disease; the benefit should outweigh the risk.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment is necessary for mild to moderate impairment. Severe hepatic impairment has not been studied.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring is recommended for patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hyperplasia, urinary retention, or seizure disorders.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Glycopyrrolate + Indacaterol is *not* indicated for acute settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It's solely for the *maintenance* treatment of COPD.


### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- No dosage adjustment is required for mild to moderate hepatic or renal impairment.
- For severe renal or hepatic impairment, the drug should be used with caution, and the benefits should outweigh the potential risks.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Upper respiratory tract infection
- Nasopharyngitis (sore throat and runny nose)
- Runny or stuffy nose
- Headache
- Dizziness
- Cough

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to indacaterol, glycopyrrolate, or any component of the formulation (including milk proteins in Utibron Neohaler).
- Asthma (monotherapy).
- Patients using other LABAs.


## **Drug Interactions**

- **Beta-blockers:** May reduce the bronchodilatory effects of indacaterol and could induce bronchospasm in susceptible individuals.
- **Other adrenergic drugs:** Additive effects on blood pressure and heart rate.
- **Xanthine derivatives, steroids, diuretics:** May enhance hypokalemia.
- **MAOIs, TCAs, QTc-prolonging agents:** May increase cardiovascular effects and risk of arrhythmias.
- **Anticholinergics:** May enhance anticholinergic side effects.
- **CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers:** No dose adjustment is typically needed.




## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (US FDA); B3 (Australia). The drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Beta-agonists may interfere with uterine contractility.
- **Breastfeeding:**  The effects on nursing infants are unknown.  A decision should be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.  Indacaterol and glycopyrrolate and their metabolites have been detected in the milk of lactating rats.
