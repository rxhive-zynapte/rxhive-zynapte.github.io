## **Usage**

Glycopyrronium + Vilanterol is prescribed for the **long-term, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**, including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema.  It is **not** indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm or the treatment of asthma.

This fixed-dose combination medication belongs to the **bronchodilator** class and comprises a **long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), Glycopyrronium, and a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA), Vilanterol.**

Glycopyrronium blocks the action of acetylcholine at M3 muscarinic receptors in the lungs, leading to bronchodilation. Vilanterol stimulates beta2-adrenergic receptors, resulting in relaxation of airway smooth muscle and bronchodilation. The combined action of these two components provides synergistic bronchodilation.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Glycopyrronium + Vilanterol" represents the generic name, this combination is marketed under the brand name **Bevespi Aerosphere**.  Formoterol is an alternate name for Vilanterol.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Glycopyrronium, as a LAMA, competitively inhibits the binding of acetylcholine to M3 muscarinic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, reducing bronchoconstriction. Vilanterol, as a LABA, stimulates beta2-adrenergic receptors, activating adenylate cyclase and increasing intracellular cyclic AMP levels. This leads to relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and bronchodilation.  The combination produces synergistic bronchodilation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Glycopyrronium:** Following inhalation, approximately 40% of the dose is systemically absorbed. Peak plasma concentrations are achieved rapidly (around 5 minutes).  It is predominantly eliminated renally, primarily in its unchanged form.
* **Vilanterol:** After inhalation, it exhibits high plasma clearance.  It is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 enzymes in the liver.

**Mode of Action:** The two components act on distinct pathways to achieve bronchodilation.  Glycopyrronium acts through receptor antagonism, while Vilanterol acts through receptor agonism.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Glycopyrronium binds to and blocks M3 muscarinic receptors. Vilanterol binds to and activates beta2-adrenergic receptors.  Vilanterol is metabolized by CYP3A4 enzymes.

**Elimination Pathways:** Glycopyrronium is primarily eliminated by renal excretion. Vilanterol is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism through CYP3A4 enzymes.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard dose of Glycopyrronium + Vilanterol (Bevespi Aerosphere) is **two inhalations (puffs) in the morning and two inhalations in the evening**, administered via the Aerosphere inhaler. Each puff contains 9 mcg of glycopyrronium and 4.8 mcg of formoterol.

#### **Children:**

Use is **not recommended** in pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary for mild to moderate impairment.  For severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance â‰¤ 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis, use only if the expected benefit outweighs the potential risk. Close monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Since formoterol is primarily cleared by hepatic metabolism, impairment may lead to accumulation. Close monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration should be given to patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, or prostatic hyperplasia.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Glycopyrronium + Vilanterol is **not** indicated for acute situations such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It is specifically for the *maintenance treatment of COPD*.  A short-acting bronchodilator should be used for acute exacerbations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be needed based on individual patient response and tolerability.  Close monitoring of patients with renal or hepatic impairment is essential.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Nasopharyngitis (common cold)
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Back Pain
* Pneumonia
* Urinary tract infection


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Paradoxical bronchospasm
* Worsening of asthma symptoms (if misused for asthma)
* Cardiovascular effects (e.g., palpitations, tachycardia, QT prolongation)
* Angioedema, hypersensitivity
* Hyperglycemia
* Hypokalemia
* Urinary retention
* Narrow-angle glaucoma


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term effects are primarily related to the potential for cardiovascular complications, worsening of pre-existing conditions like glaucoma and urinary retention, and potential impact on bone mineral density with inhaled corticosteroids.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Clinically significant ADRs primarily involve paradoxical bronchospasm, severe cardiovascular effects, and hypersensitivity reactions.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to glycopyrronium, vilanterol, or any component of the formulation.
* Asthma (without concomitant inhaled corticosteroid).


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Beta-blockers:** May antagonize the bronchodilatory effects of vilanterol.
* **QT Prolonging Drugs:**  May increase the risk of QT prolongation and arrhythmias with vilanterol. Examples include certain antiarrhythmics, antibiotics, and antidepressants.
* **CYP3A4 Inhibitors/Inducers:** May affect the metabolism of vilanterol, necessitating dose adjustments.
* **Diuretics:** May exacerbate hypokalemia.
* **Other LABAs or LAMAs:** Concomitant use is not recommended due to the increased risk of adverse effects.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Glycopyrronium + Vilanterol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  It is unknown whether glycopyrronium or vilanterol are excreted in human milk. The decision to breastfeed during therapy should consider the potential risk to the infant.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** LAMA (Glycopyrronium) and LABA (Vilanterol) combination producing synergistic bronchodilation.
* **Side Effects:** Common: Headache, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection. Serious: Paradoxical bronchospasm, cardiovascular effects.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, asthma (without ICS).
