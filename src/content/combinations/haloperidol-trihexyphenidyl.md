## **Usage**

Haloperidol + Trihexyphenidyl is prescribed to manage the symptoms of psychosis, such as schizophrenia, and movement disorders like Parkinson's disease or those induced by other medications (e.g., antipsychotics).  Haloperidol is an antipsychotic, and Trihexyphenidyl is an anticholinergic.

Haloperidol primarily blocks dopamine D2 receptors in the brain, which helps to alleviate psychotic symptoms.  Trihexyphenidyl works by blocking acetylcholine's effects, helping to reduce movement problems, especially drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) like tremors or stiffness, often caused by Haloperidol.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication doesn't typically have a single name. It is more commonly referred to as Haloperidol co-administered with Trihexyphenidyl. Brand names for Haloperidol include Haldol.  Brand names for Trihexyphenidyl include Artane and Pacitane.


## **How It Works**

**Haloperidol:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Blocks dopamine D2 receptors, reducing dopaminergic neurotransmission. It also affects other receptors like serotonin, alpha-adrenergic, and histamine receptors, contributing to its side effect profile.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Well-absorbed orally but undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism.  Metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP enzymes (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4). Excreted in urine and feces.

**Trihexyphenidyl:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Antagonizes muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, restoring balance between dopaminergic and cholinergic activity, thus improving movement control.
* **Pharmacokinetics:**  Well-absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver. Elimination pathway not fully characterized, but likely involves both renal and hepatic routes.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Haloperidol:** Initial 0.5-5 mg two to three times daily.  May be gradually increased up to 100 mg/day as needed.
* **Trihexyphenidyl:**  Initial 1 mg daily. May be gradually increased up to 15 mg/day in divided doses.


#### **Children:**

* **Haloperidol:** For children (3-12 years weighing 15-40 kg) dosage based on body weight and must be determined by a doctor.  Children older than 13 can take adult dosage after an assessment.
* **Trihexyphenidyl:** Use and dosage must be determined by a doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses of both medications and titrate cautiously due to increased sensitivity.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments needed for both medications, especially Haloperidol.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Close monitoring and dose adjustments for Haloperidol are needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful assessment is needed for patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or other conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in these settings should be individualized and guided by symptom severity. Continuous ECG monitoring is recommended, particularly with IV Haloperidol.

* **Intubation:** Haloperidol can be used for sedation and delirium.
* **Surgical Procedures:** Not typically used.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** Can be used to manage agitation.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Commonly used for delirium. IV Haloperidol may be preferred in acute settings, starting with 2-10 mg and titrating carefully.
* **Emergency Situations:**  For acute psychosis or agitation, IM Haloperidol might be administered.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Renal/hepatic impairment, metabolic disorders, genetic polymorphisms, and other factors may affect drug metabolism, requiring careful dosage adjustment.  Consult a pharmacist or clinical pharmacologist for guidance on specific cases.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* **Haloperidol:** Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) like dystonia, akathisia, parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia; drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation.
* **Trihexyphenidyl:** Dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention, cognitive impairment.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* **Haloperidol:** Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, seizures.
* **Trihexyphenidyl:** Angle-closure glaucoma, paralytic ileus, cardiac arrhythmias.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

* **Haloperidol:** Tardive dyskinesia, cognitive impairment, metabolic syndrome.
* **Trihexyphenidyl:**  Cognitive decline, especially in elderly patients.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any signs of NMS, severe EPS, or cardiac arrhythmias require immediate intervention.


## **Contraindications**

* **Haloperidol:** Parkinson's disease (unless used for psychosis in Parkinson's patients), CNS depression, severe liver disease.
* **Trihexyphenidyl:** Narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, myasthenia gravis, megacolon.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Haloperidol:**  Interacts with CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines), antihypertensives, QT-prolonging drugs.  CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers can affect Haloperidol levels.
* **Trihexyphenidyl:**  Interacts with other anticholinergics (additive effects),  antihistamines, some antidepressants.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Haloperidol:** Use cautiously in pregnancy. Risk of EPS and withdrawal symptoms in neonates.
* **Trihexyphenidyl:** Limited data.  Use only if clearly needed.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

See information provided under "Usage," "Side Effects," "Contraindications," "Drug Interactions," and "Pregnancy and Breastfeeding."

## **Popular Combinations**

Haloperidol is often combined with Trihexyphenidyl to mitigate EPS.


## **Precautions**

Standard precautions for antipsychotics and anticholinergics should be taken.
