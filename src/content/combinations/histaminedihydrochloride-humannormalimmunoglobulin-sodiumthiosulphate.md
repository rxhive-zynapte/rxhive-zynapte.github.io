## **Usage**

Histamine Dihydrochloride + Human Normal Immunoglobulin + Sodium Thiosulphate is prescribed for various allergic conditions. These include eczema, urticaria, allergic rhinitis, generalized skin allergies, migraine headaches, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and respiratory distress.  It aids in preventing and treating these conditions.

It is classified as an immunotherapy agent.

This combination medication works by modulating the immune response to allergens. The human normal immunoglobulin component provides antibodies that neutralize histamine, a chemical mediator of allergic reactions.  The histamine dihydrochloride component, paradoxically, also contributes to reducing allergic responses.

## **Alternate Names**

While this medication doesn't have a universally recognized International Nonproprietary Name (INN), it is often referred to as "Histamine + Human Normal Immunoglobulin + Sodium Thiosulphate" or "Histamine Dihydrochloride/Human Normal Immunoglobulin/Sodium Thiosulphate combination."  A common brand name is Histoglob.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Human Normal Immunoglobulin contains antibodies that neutralize histamine, thereby reducing allergic symptoms. Histamine Dihydrochloride, in this specific combination and at the very low dose used, also helps regulate the immune response to allergens and may suppress the maturation of eosinophils (a type of white blood cell involved in allergic reactions). Sodium Thiosulphate is believed to have some antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  The medication is administered subcutaneously.  Absorption from the subcutaneous site is relatively slow and sustained. The immunoglobulin component is distributed throughout the body via the lymphatic system.  The metabolism and elimination pathways of the individual components in this specific combination have not been extensively studied.  Human normal immunoglobulin generally has a half-life of several weeks. Histamine is rapidly metabolized, primarily by the enzymes diamine oxidase and histamine-N-methyltransferase.  Sodium thiosulphate is primarily renally excreted.

**Mode of Action:** Human Normal Immunoglobulin provides preformed antibodies that bind to and neutralize histamine, thus mitigating the effects of histamine on target cells.  The mode of action of the very small dose of histamine dihydrochloride in this combination is not fully understood but may involve modulation of immune cells, including suppressing eosinophil maturation.  Sodium thiosulphate may have an antioxidant role, but its exact contribution to this combination is not fully elucidated.  

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 1 ml injection subcutaneously every 4 days for a total of 3 injections.  The course may be repeated after one month. For chronic allergic conditions, booster doses may be given 3 and 6 months after the initial course.

#### **Children:** 1 ml injection subcutaneously every 8 days for a total of 3 injections.  The course may be repeated after one month.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are explicitly mentioned, but cautious use is advisable.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are explicitly mentioned, but caution is advised as sodium thiosulfate is primarily excreted renally.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are explicitly mentioned.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific dosage adjustments are available, but it is essential to consider the patient's overall health status and coexisting medical conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**
