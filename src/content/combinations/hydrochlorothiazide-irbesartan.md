## **Usage**

- Hydrochlorothiazide + Irbesartan is prescribed for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure).  It may be used as initial therapy or in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by monotherapy with either drug alone.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Combination antihypertensive; thiazide diuretic combined with an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination medication lowers blood pressure through two distinct mechanisms. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic which increases the excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys, reducing blood volume.  Irbesartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) that blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that causes blood vessels to constrict. By blocking angiotensin II, Irbesartan causes vasodilation, lowering peripheral resistance.

## **Alternate Names** 

- International variations exist.
- **Brand Names:** Several brands are available, including Avalide.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Hydrochlorothiazide decreases blood volume, while Irbesartan causes vasodilation. Together, they lower blood pressure synergistically.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Both drugs are orally administered. Irbesartan is well absorbed, metabolized by the liver via CYP2C9, and excreted in both bile and urine.  Hydrochlorothiazide is less well absorbed, is not extensively metabolized, and is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. 
- **Mode of Action:** Hydrochlorothiazide acts on the distal convoluted tubule in the kidneys, inhibiting sodium and chloride reabsorption.  Irbesartan selectively blocks the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor, preventing angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Irbesartan is eliminated by hepatic metabolism and biliary/renal excretion.  Hydrochlorothiazide is primarily eliminated by renal excretion.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**  
#### **Adults:**  
- Initial therapy typically starts with 150 mg Irbesartan/12.5 mg Hydrochlorothiazide once daily. This may be increased to 300 mg Irbesartan/12.5 mg or 300 mg Irbesartan/25 mg once daily as needed to control blood pressure. Maximum antihypertensive effect is usually achieved within 2-4 weeks of a dose change.

#### **Children:**  
- The safety and effectiveness of this combination in children have not been established. Dosage must be determined by a doctor on a case-by-case basis.

#### **Special Cases:**  
- **Elderly Patients:**  Start with the lowest dose and titrate carefully.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary in severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration is required for patients with conditions such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  
- This medication is primarily indicated for chronic hypertension management.  Its use in acute settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergencies is not routinely recommended.  Other medications are typically preferred for rapid blood pressure control in these situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**  
- Dose modifications are based on individual patient response and renal/hepatic function.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**  
- Dizziness, lightheadedness, and fatigue.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**  
- Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), hypotension, and worsening renal function.

### **Long-Term Effects**  
- Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia (low potassium), may occur with long-term use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
- Severe hypotension, syncope, acute renal failure, and angioedema require immediate medical attention.

## **Contraindications**
- Hypersensitivity to either drug or sulfonamide-derived medications.
- Pregnancy (especially second and third trimesters)
- Anuria (lack of urine production)
- Concomitant use of aliskiren in patients with diabetes.

## **Drug Interactions**
- Other antihypertensive medications may potentiate the blood pressure-lowering effect.
- NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) can reduce the antihypertensive effect.
- Lithium levels may increase with concomitant use.
- Potassium-sparing diuretics can lead to hyperkalemia.
- Alcohol can enhance the hypotensive effects.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** D (contraindicated in second and third trimesters). Irbesartan is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of fetal harm. Hydrochlorothiazide can cause fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults.
- **Breastfeeding:**  This combination is not recommended during breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**
- **Mechanism of Action:** Diuretic and angiotensin II receptor blockade.
- **Side Effects:** Dizziness, lightheadedness, hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, and rarely, angioedema.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, pregnancy, anuria, concomitant use of aliskiren in patients with diabetes.
- **Drug Interactions:** Other antihypertensives, NSAIDs, lithium, potassium-sparing diuretics, alcohol.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy and not recommended while breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:**  Starting dose: 150/12.5 mg once daily, adjustable up to 300/25 mg.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, renal function, electrolytes (especially potassium).

## **Popular Combinations**
- Other antihypertensives may be added if blood pressure control is inadequate.

## **Precautions**
- **General Precautions:** Monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes.
- **Specific Populations:**  Use with caution in elderly patients and those with renal or hepatic impairment. Contraindicated in pregnancy. Not recommended during breastfeeding.
