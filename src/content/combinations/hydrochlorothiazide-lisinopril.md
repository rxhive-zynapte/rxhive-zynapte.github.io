      **A:** Hydrochlorothiazide + Lisinopril can increase serum potassium
      levels, so concomitant use with potassium supplements or salt substitutes
      can lead to hyperkalemia.  Close monitoring of potassium levels is
      essential.

## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Hydrochlorothiazide + Lisinopril is primarily prescribed for the management of hypertension (high blood pressure).  It is used when treatment with individual components (lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide alone) is insufficient to control blood pressure.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  This combination drug belongs to two classes:
    - Lisinopril: Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitor
    - Hydrochlorothiazide: Thiazide diuretic
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Lisinopril works by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. This leads to vasodilation and a decrease in aldosterone secretion, resulting in lower blood pressure. Hydrochlorothiazide increases the excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys, further contributing to blood pressure reduction.

## **Alternate Names**

- No official alternate generic names exist for this fixed-dose combination.
- **Brand Names:** Zestoretic, Prinzide.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Lisinopril lowers blood pressure through vasodilation and reduction of aldosterone secretion. Hydrochlorothiazide exerts its diuretic action by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron, leading to increased excretion of sodium and water.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Both drugs are orally absorbed, although lisinopril's absorption is somewhat variable and not affected by food.
    - **Metabolism:**  Lisinopril is not metabolized. Hydrochlorothiazide undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism.
    - **Elimination:**  Lisinopril is excreted primarily unchanged in the urine.  Hydrochlorothiazide is also eliminated mainly through renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** Lisinopril acts by inhibiting ACE, preventing the formation of angiotensin II.  Hydrochlorothiazide inhibits the sodium-chloride cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule, impeding sodium reabsorption.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Lisinopril inhibits ACE. Hydrochlorothiazide inhibits the sodium-chloride cotransporter.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for both lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: 10 mg lisinopril/12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide or 20 mg lisinopril/12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide orally once daily.
- Dosage adjustments can be made every 2-3 weeks based on blood pressure response.
- Maximum dose: 80 mg lisinopril/50 mg hydrochlorothiazide per day.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for pediatric use. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children under 18.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Start at the low end of the dosing range and titrate cautiously. Consider age-related decline in renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** 
    - Mild to moderate impairment (CrCl > 30 mL/min): No initial dose adjustment. Careful monitoring is recommended.
    - Severe impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min): Not recommended, loop diuretics are preferred.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution.  Dose adjustment may be needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Close monitoring is required in patients with diabetes, heart failure, or other cardiovascular diseases.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  Dosage primarily pertains to chronic hypertension management, and this medication is generally not indicated for acute situations such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like cardiac arrest.
