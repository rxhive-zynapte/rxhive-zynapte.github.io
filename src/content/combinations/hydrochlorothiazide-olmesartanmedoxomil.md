## **Usage**

- Hydrochlorothiazide + Olmesartan Medoxomil is prescribed for the treatment of essential hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by olmesartan medoxomil alone or hydrochlorothiazide alone.  It is not indicated for initial therapy.
- **Pharmacological classification**:  Antihypertensive; a combination of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and a thiazide diuretic.
- **Mechanism of Action**: Olmesartan blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that causes blood vessels to constrict, leading to vasodilation. Hydrochlorothiazide increases the excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys, reducing blood volume and further lowering blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

- Olmesartan medoxomil/hydrochlorothiazide
- Olmesartan medoxomil/HCTZ
- **Brand Names**: Benicar HCT, Olmetec Plus HCT (and various generics)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Olmesartan, an ARB, selectively blocks the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor, inhibiting the vasoconstricting and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II. Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron, increasing sodium and water excretion. This leads to decreased blood volume and peripheral vascular resistance, thereby lowering blood pressure.
- **Pharmacokinetics**: *Absorption:* Olmesartan medoxomil is an oral prodrug rapidly hydrolyzed to the active metabolite olmesartan during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Hydrochlorothiazide is also well-absorbed orally. *Metabolism:* Olmesartan undergoes minimal metabolism. Hydrochlorothiazide is not extensively metabolized. *Elimination:* Olmesartan is eliminated primarily in bile and feces, with a small amount in urine. Hydrochlorothiazide is excreted primarily unchanged in the urine. 
- **Mode of Action**: Olmesartan exerts its effects by competitively binding to and blocking AT1 receptors, preventing angiotensin II binding. Hydrochlorothiazide inhibits the sodium-chloride symporter in the distal tubule, reducing sodium reabsorption.
- **Receptor binding**: Olmesartan binds selectively to AT1 receptors. 
- **Elimination pathways**: Olmesartan is primarily eliminated through biliary/fecal excretion, with a small portion in urine. Hydrochlorothiazide is excreted mainly unchanged in the urine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults**:

- Initial dose: 20/12.5 mg (olmesartan/hydrochlorothiazide) once daily.  If blood pressure remains uncontrolled with olmesartan monotherapy, increase to 40/12.5 mg once daily or titrate up to a maximum of 40/25 mg, as needed. For patients uncontrolled with hydrochlorothiazide alone, begin with 20/12.5 mg.  Dosage adjustments should be made at 2-4 week intervals.


#### **Children**:

- Not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

#### **Special Cases**:

- **Elderly Patients**: Initiate therapy at the lower end of the dosing range (20/12.5 mg) due to the potential for decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**:  No dosage adjustment necessary for mild to moderate renal impairment (CrCl > 30 mL/min). Not recommended in severe renal impairment (CrCl â‰¤ 30 mL/min).
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Start with a lower dose of 10 mg olmesartan once daily in moderate hepatic impairment, not exceeding 20 mg daily.  Close monitoring of blood pressure and renal function is advised in patients with hepatic impairment who are receiving diuretics and/or other antihypertensive agents. Not recommended in severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**:  Close monitoring is recommended for patients with heart failure, diabetes, or other conditions.  In patients with diabetes, avoid concomitant use with aliskiren.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- This medication is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its primary use is for chronic hypertension management in an outpatient setting.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjust dosages based on patient response and tolerability, monitoring blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes. Patients with hepatic or renal impairment may require dose reductions.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Dizziness, lightheadedness, headache
- Upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., stuffy nose, sore throat)
- Back pain, fatigue
- Increased uric acid levels
- Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Angioedema (swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat)
- Hypotension
- Renal failure
- Electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hyponatremia)
- Rhabdomyolysis
- Liver dysfunction



### **Long-Term Effects**

- Potential for electrolyte imbalances, renal dysfunction, and cardiovascular events if hypertension is not adequately controlled.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

## **Contraindications**

- Pregnancy (especially second and third trimesters)
- Anuria
- Hypersensitivity to olmesartan, hydrochlorothiazide, or sulfonamides
- Concomitant use of aliskiren in patients with diabetes



## **Drug Interactions**

- Other antihypertensives (additive hypotensive effect)
- Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements (risk of hyperkalemia)
- Lithium (increased lithium levels)
- NSAIDs (decreased antihypertensive effect, increased risk of renal impairment)
- Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (increased risk of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and renal dysfunction)
- Colesevelam hydrochloride (reduced olmesartan absorption)



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category**: D (contraindicated in second and third trimesters)
- Fetal risks:  Renal failure, growth retardation, lung hypoplasia, skeletal malformations, death
- Breastfeeding: Not recommended; olmesartan and hydrochlorothiazide are excreted in breast milk.
