## **Usage**

Hydrochlorothiazide + Ramipril is prescribed for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure).  It combines two medications with different mechanisms of action to achieve better blood pressure control than either drug alone.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antihypertensive (a combination of a thiazide diuretic and an ACE inhibitor).

- **Mechanism of Action:** Hydrochlorothiazide increases the excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys, reducing blood volume and lowering blood pressure. Ramipril inhibits the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), preventing the formation of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. This leads to vasodilation and a decrease in blood pressure.


## **Alternate Names**

The combination of hydrochlorothiazide and ramipril doesn't have a specific international nonproprietary name (INN). It is generally referred to by the names of its two components.

- **Brand Names:**  Numerous brand names exist globally, including Tritazide, Cardace H, and various generic formulations.



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Hydrochlorothiazide acts on the distal convoluted tubule in the kidneys, inhibiting sodium and chloride reabsorption. This leads to increased excretion of water, sodium, chloride, and potassium, reducing blood volume and lowering peripheral vascular resistance.  Ramipril, as an ACE inhibitor, reduces the formation of angiotensin II and increases levels of bradykinin. This causes vasodilation, reduces aldosterone secretion (leading to less sodium and water retention), and decreases sympathetic nervous system activity. The combination of these mechanisms produces a synergistic antihypertensive effect.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Hydrochlorothiazide is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentration within 1-2.5 hours. It is not extensively metabolized and is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Ramipril is an oral prodrug that is rapidly metabolized in the liver to its active metabolite, ramiprilat. Ramiprilat has a longer half-life than ramipril and is primarily excreted by the kidneys.

- **Mode of Action:** Hydrochlorothiazide acts by inhibiting the sodium-chloride symporter in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron. Ramipril inhibits ACE, a key enzyme in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) responsible for converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II.

- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Hydrochlorothiazide's primary action is enzyme inhibition. Ramipril also works through enzyme inhibition.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated primarily via renal excretion. Ramipril is metabolized to ramiprilat in the liver, with ramiprilat subsequently excreted mainly by the kidneys.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The usual starting dose is 2.5 mg ramipril and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily, usually taken in the morning.
- The dose can be increased at 2-3 week intervals as needed to achieve blood pressure control.
- The maximum dose is 10 mg ramipril and 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide per day.

#### **Children:**

- This combination is not recommended for children under 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** A lower starting dose and slower titration may be necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary based on creatinine clearance. The combination is contraindicated in severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min).
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** The combination is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is required in patients with diabetes, heart failure, or other cardiovascular diseases.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Hydrochlorothiazide + Ramipril is not typically used in acute clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. It is intended for chronic management of hypertension.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on individual patient characteristics, including renal function, hepatic function, and response to therapy.  Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism may also require dose modifications, though this is not routine practice.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Dizziness, lightheadedness, cough, headache, fatigue, nausea, and electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hypokalemia).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), severe hypotension, acute renal failure, and liver dysfunction.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Electrolyte imbalances, kidney problems, and cardiovascular events if hypertension is not adequately controlled.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and other hypersensitivity reactions.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to ramipril, hydrochlorothiazide, or any component of the formulation.
- History of angioedema.
- Pregnancy and lactation.
- Severe renal or hepatic impairment.
- Concomitant use of sacubitril/valsartan.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Other antihypertensives (additive hypotensive effect).
- Potassium-sparing diuretics (increased risk of hyperkalemia).
- Lithium (increased lithium levels).
- NSAIDs (reduced antihypertensive effect).
- Alcohol (additive hypotensive effect).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** D (contraindicated).  Ramipril is known to cause fetal harm, particularly in the second and third trimesters. Hydrochlorothiazide can cause fetal thrombocytopenia and other adverse effects.
- **Breastfeeding:** Ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide are excreted in breast milk. The combination is contraindicated during breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Combined diuretic and RAAS inhibition.
- **Side Effects:**  Dizziness, cough, hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, angioedema.
- **Contraindications:**  Angioedema history, pregnancy, severe renal/hepatic impairment.
- **Drug Interactions:**  Other antihypertensives, potassium-sparing diuretics, lithium, NSAIDs.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
- **Dosage:** 2.5/12.5 mg once daily, titrated as needed. Max: 10/50 mg.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, potassium levels, renal function.


## **Popular Combinations**

This drug itself is a popular combination.  Sometimes other antihypertensive agents such as calcium channel blockers or beta-blockers might be added if blood pressure control is inadequate.


## **Precautions**

- Assess renal and hepatic function before initiating therapy.
- Monitor electrolytes, especially potassium.
- Caution in patients with heart failure, diabetes, and other cardiovascular diseases.
- Avoid alcohol consumption.
