## **Usage**

Hydrocortisone + Miconazole is prescribed for inflammatory skin infections where fungal or bacterial infection is present with inflammation. It is indicated for infected eczema, candidal intertrigo, and tinea pedis.  

**Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing a corticosteroid (hydrocortisone) and an antifungal (miconazole). Thus, it can be classified as a combination topical anti-inflammatory and antifungal agent.

**Mechanism of Action:** Hydrocortisone reduces inflammation by decreasing vascular permeability, suppressing leukocyte migration, and causing vasoconstriction. Miconazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis, a vital component of fungal cell membranes, leading to fungal cell death. It also demonstrates activity against some gram-positive bacteria.

## **Alternate Names**

No alternate generic names found.

**Brand Names:** Daktacort, Resolve Plus, others.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Hydrocortisone exerts its anti-inflammatory effect through binding to glucocorticoid receptors, which modulates gene expression related to inflammation. Miconazole works by inhibiting the fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme lanosterol 14Î±-demethylase, thereby blocking ergosterol synthesis. This disrupts the fungal cell membrane, leading to cell death. 

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Hydrocortisone has approximately 3% cutaneous absorption. Miconazole is minimally absorbed systemically (&lt;1% bioavailability) but persists in the skin for several days after application.
* **Metabolism:** Hydrocortisone is metabolized primarily in the liver to inactive metabolites. Miconazole metabolism is not fully understood but is thought to be primarily hepatic.
* **Elimination:** Hydrocortisone metabolites, mainly glucuronides, are excreted in the urine, along with a small amount of unchanged drug. Miconazole is predominantly eliminated in feces, with minor urinary excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer to the affected area two to three times daily. Gently rub until absorbed. The maximum recommended treatment duration is 7 days for cream formulations. For ointment formulations, continue until inflammation subsides (around 7 days), then switch to miconazole monotherapy.


#### **Children:**  Similar dosing as adults. Some sources suggest use is not recommended under 2 years of age. Use with caution in children due to increased risk of systemic absorption. 

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use sparingly and for shorter durations due to age-related skin thinning. 
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustment required due to limited systemic absorption. However, caution is advised.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustment recommended, but caution is warranted.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  No specific adjustments indicated, but monitor patients with conditions such as diabetes or those receiving oral anticoagulants for potential interactions or exacerbations.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is not typically used in settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or emergency situations like cardiac arrest. Its use is mainly limited to topical dermatological conditions.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific dosage adjustments are generally required based on renal or hepatic dysfunction. However, caution should be exercised in these populations.

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Local skin irritation, burning, pruritus, rash, contact dermatitis, erythema, hypopigmentation.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema; adrenal suppression (with prolonged use or use over large areas), irritability.

### **Long-Term Effects:** Skin atrophy, telangiectasia, striae, skin fragility.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Anaphylaxis, angioedema, adrenal suppression.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone, miconazole, or any component of the formulation; tubercular, viral (e.g. herpes, chicken pox), or gram-negative bacterial skin infections; acne, rosacea, perioral dermatitis, ulcerative skin conditions.

## **Drug Interactions**

May increase the effect of oral anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin); Miconazole may inhibit the metabolism of hydrocortisone. Latex contraceptive agents can be damaged.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

No absolute contraindication, but use cautiously during pregnancy and breastfeeding, especially during the first trimester and on large areas. Avoid applying to breasts if breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Hydrocortisone: Anti-inflammatory via glucocorticoid receptor binding. Miconazole: Antifungal via ergosterol synthesis inhibition.
* **Side Effects:** Local skin reactions, hypersensitivity, adrenal suppression (rarely).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, specific skin infections.
* **Drug Interactions:** Oral anticoagulants, latex contraceptives.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution.
* **Dosage:** Apply thinly 2-3 times daily for up to 7 days.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for local skin reactions, signs of infection worsening, and (with prolonged use) signs of adrenal suppression.

## **Popular Combinations**

This is already a combination product.  No other combination is mentioned in the sources.

## **Precautions**

Avoid contact with eyes. Discontinue if hypersensitivity occurs.  Prolonged use can lead to skin atrophy, telangiectasia, and striae. Pre-screening is advisable for patients with allergies or pre-existing skin conditions.
