## **Usage**

This topical medication is primarily prescribed for **androgenetic alopecia**, commonly known as male or female pattern baldness. It can also be used to treat other types of hair loss where inflammation and/or reduced blood flow to the hair follicles may be contributing factors.  It is classified as a **dermatological** agent.

The combination targets multiple factors contributing to hair loss. Hydrocortisone, a corticosteroid, reduces scalp inflammation. Minoxidil, a vasodilator, improves blood circulation to hair follicles. Tretinoin, a retinoid (a form of vitamin A), promotes hair follicle growth and enhances minoxidil absorption.


## **Alternate Names**

There is no officially recognized alternate name for this specific combination product. However, it is a combination of three distinct drugs: Hydrocortisone, Minoxidil, and Tretinoin. Brand names may vary depending on the manufacturer and formulation. Some examples include Hairmax Forte Solution.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Hydrocortisone:** Binds to glucocorticoid receptors, inhibiting inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins, thus reducing scalp inflammation, itching, and redness.
* **Minoxidil:** The exact mechanism for hair growth promotion is not fully understood. It is believed to act as a vasodilator, increasing blood flow to hair follicles, providing more oxygen and nutrients. It may also open potassium channels and stimulate hair follicle growth factors. It prolongs the anagen (growth) phase of the hair cycle.
* **Tretinoin:**  Increases cell turnover in hair follicles, promoting growth and enhancing minoxidil absorption through the scalp. It is also thought to have anti-inflammatory properties in skin.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Hydrocortisone:**  Topically applied hydrocortisone is minimally absorbed systemically. It's metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys.
* **Minoxidil:**  When applied topically, minoxidil is partially absorbed. Systemic absorption is minimal with topical application unless used on large areas of the scalp. It is metabolized in the liver and primarily excreted in urine and feces.
* **Tretinoin:** Tretinoin is metabolized in the skin and liver, primarily via CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 enzymes, and excreted in urine and feces.



## **Dosage**

Dosage is determined by the physician based on the patient's condition, and available formulations. The medication is typically available as a topical solution or foam.
