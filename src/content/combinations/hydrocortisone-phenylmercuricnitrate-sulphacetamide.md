## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily used for the treatment of superficial bacterial eye infections, such as conjunctivitis (pink eye) and blepharitis.  It combines the antibacterial action of sulphacetamide with the anti-inflammatory effects of hydrocortisone. Phenyl mercuric nitrate acts as a preservative.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* **Sulphacetamide:** Sulfonamide antibiotic
* **Hydrocortisone:** Corticosteroid
* **Phenyl Mercuric Nitrate:** Antiseptic and preservative

**Mechanism of Action:**  Sulphacetamide inhibits bacterial growth by interfering with folic acid synthesis, which is essential for bacterial DNA and RNA production. Hydrocortisone reduces inflammation by suppressing the immune response and inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins.


## **Alternate Names**

Sulpha FH Eye Drop (This might vary regionally)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Sulphacetamide exerts its antibacterial effect by competitively inhibiting dihydropteroate synthase, a bacterial enzyme crucial for folic acid synthesis. Hydrocortisone, through its glucocorticoid receptor activity, modulates gene expression and influences the function of various immune cells, thus suppressing inflammation.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Topical application minimizes systemic absorption, but some hydrocortisone can be absorbed systemically. Sulphacetamide is primarily excreted renally.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Instill 1-2 drops into the affected eye(s) every 2-3 hours initially.  As the infection improves, the frequency can be reduced as directed by the physician. Treatment should continue for at least a week, even if symptoms subside, to ensure complete eradication of the infection.

#### **Children:** Dosage in children should be determined by a pediatrician, considering the child's age and weight. Safety and efficacy in children younger than two years old have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is typically required, but monitoring for potential systemic side effects of hydrocortisone is advised.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution should be exercised, and dosage adjustment might be necessary in patients with severe renal dysfunction.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Close monitoring is recommended, and dosage adjustments may be considered in patients with significant hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Patients with diabetes, glaucoma, or other ocular conditions should be monitored closely during treatment.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication is specifically for bacterial eye infections and not indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments should be based on patient response and clinical judgment.  More frequent instillations may be necessary initially for severe infections.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Transient burning or stinging upon instillation
* Eye irritation or redness
* Blurred vision (immediately after application)


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) with prolonged use
* Secondary fungal or viral eye infections

### **Long-Term Effects**

Prolonged use of topical corticosteroids like hydrocortisone can lead to glaucoma, cataracts, or thinning of the cornea.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, though rare, necessitate immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication
* Viral or fungal eye infections (e.g., herpes simplex keratitis, fungal keratitis)
* Untreated purulent eye infections


## **Drug Interactions**

No clinically significant drug interactions are expected with topical application. However, administer other ophthalmic medications at least 5-10 minutes apart.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been definitively established. Consult a physician to assess the benefit-risk ratio.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Sulphacetamide inhibits bacterial folic acid synthesis; hydrocortisone suppresses inflammation.
* **Side Effects:** Burning/stinging, eye irritation, blurred vision (common); allergic reactions, increased IOP, secondary infections (rare).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, viral/fungal eye infections, untreated purulent infections.
* **Drug Interactions:**  No significant interactions expected.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Safety not established.
* **Dosage:** 1-2 drops every 2-3 hours initially, then taper as directed.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for allergic reactions, IOP, and resolution of infection.


## **Popular Combinations**

This combination itself is a common formulation, and further combinations are generally not recommended. Always consult an ophthalmologist before combining any eye medications.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Screen for allergies and assess ocular health before initiating treatment.
* **Specific Populations:** Consult a physician for pregnant/breastfeeding women.  Pediatric dosing should be determined by a pediatrician.  Monitor elderly patients for systemic effects.
