## **Usage**

Hydrocortisone + Quiniodochlor is a topical combination medication used to treat various inflammatory dermatological conditions, particularly superficial skin infections complicated by inflammation, such as eczema, athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm.  It is also prescribed for inflammatory skin disorders such as seborrheic dermatitis and intertrigo when secondary bacterial or fungal infections are also present.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Hydrocortisone: Corticosteroid, anti-inflammatory agent.
* Quiniodochlor: Antifungal, antibacterial agent.

**Mechanism of Action:**

Hydrocortisone, a glucocorticoid, works by suppressing the inflammatory response. It inhibits the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which are mediators of inflammation. It also decreases inflammation by reducing the activity of the lymphatic system. Quiniodochlor is an antimicrobial agent that kills microorganisms causing skin infections, including fungi and bacteria, by chelating ferrous ions essential for microbial growth.


## **Alternate Names**

* Corto-Quinol (brand name)
* Vioform Hydrocortisone (Canadian brand name)
* Alcortin (brand name)
* Vytone (brand name)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Hydrocortisone exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm, translocating to the nucleus, and modulating gene transcription. This leads to decreased production of inflammatory mediators. Quiniodochlor acts by chelating divalent cations, such as ferrous ions, which are essential for fungal and bacterial growth.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Topical application leads to minimal systemic absorption of both drugs.  When absorbed systemically, hydrocortisone is metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Quiniodochlor is partially metabolized in the liver and primarily excreted in feces.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Hydrocortisone binds to glucocorticoid receptors. Quiniodochlor's mechanism involves chelation rather than enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation.

**Elimination Pathways:** Hydrocortisone is eliminated mainly through renal excretion after hepatic metabolism. Quiniodochlor is primarily eliminated in feces, with partial hepatic metabolism.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin film of the cream or ointment to the affected area 2 to 4 times daily.

#### **Children:**

* Under 2 years: Contraindicated in most countries. 
* 2 years and older:  A thin film of a 0.5% hydrocortisone and 3% clioquinol combination can be applied to the affected area 2 to 4 times daily. In Canada, a 1% hydrocortisone and 3% clioquinol cream may be used, applied 2 to 3 times daily. Adjust dosage depending on the condition and patient response. Consult local guidelines for regional recommendations.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lowest effective dose and monitor for adverse effects due to age-related decreases in hepatic, renal, and/or cardiac function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustment is typically required for topical application due to minimal systemic absorption. Systemic administration should be approached with caution.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution, as impaired liver function may affect hydrocortisone metabolism. Systemic administration should be approached with caution.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** For patients with conditions like diabetes or other metabolic disorders, monitor for systemic effects of hydrocortisone if applied over large areas.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of hydrocortisone and quiniodochlor is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, the ICU, or emergency situations. Its use is primarily for topical dermatological treatment.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on the severity of the condition and patient response.  For elderly patients or those with hepatic dysfunction, start with the lowest effective dose.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Burning
* Itching
* Irritation
* Redness
* Dryness

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

## **Drug Interactions**

Drug interactions are limited with topical use.  Avoid concomitant application of other topical medications on the same area.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Topical use is generally considered safe for short-term use over small areas.  Consult a physician before use.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Generally considered safe for short-term topical use over small areas. Avoid applying to the breast or nipple area.
