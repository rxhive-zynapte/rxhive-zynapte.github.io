## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for bacterial infections of the eye and ear.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**
    - Fluoroquinolone antibiotic (Ofloxacin)
    - Ophthalmic lubricant (Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose)
    - Preservative (Phenyl Mercuric Nitrate)


- **Mechanism of Action:** Ofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair. This action leads to bacterial cell death. Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acts as a lubricant, providing relief from dryness and discomfort. Phenylmercuric nitrate acts as a preservative to prevent contamination of the solution. Sodium phosphate acts as a buffering agent and helps maintain the pH and stability of the formulation.



## **Alternate Names**

- Ofrivid-B Eye/Ear Drops


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ofloxacin's bactericidal effect results from inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose lubricates and moisturizes the affected area. Phenylmercuric nitrate exerts its preservative action through disrupting microbial cell membranes.


- **Pharmacokinetics:** Ofloxacin, when administered topically as eye/ear drops, is absorbed systemically to a small extent. It undergoes hepatic metabolism and is primarily excreted through the kidneys. Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, used as a viscosity-increasing agent, is not systemically absorbed in significant amounts. Phenylmercuric nitrate and sodium phosphate are also minimally absorbed.


- **Elimination:** Ofloxacin is primarily eliminated renally.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Instill 1-2 drops in the affected eye/ear every 2-4 hours, or as directed by the physician.

#### **Children:** Dosage should be determined by a physician based on the child's age and weight.

#### **Special Cases:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for elderly patients, those with renal or hepatic impairment, and individuals with comorbid conditions.  Consult a physician for specific recommendations.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosage for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations should be determined by the attending physician based on the patient's specific needs.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be needed based on patient-specific factors, including renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism. Consultation with a physician is crucial for appropriate adjustments.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

- Eye/Ear irritation
- Discomfort
- Transient blurred vision
- Burning sensation

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any of the components, especially Ofloxacin, Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, or Phenyl Mercuric Nitrate.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Although no significant drug interactions have been established with topical Ofloxacin, inform your physician about all other medications being used, including other eye/ear drops, to assess potential interactions.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
