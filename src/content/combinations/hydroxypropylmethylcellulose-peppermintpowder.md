## **Usage**

Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) + Peppermint Powder is primarily indicated for the management of allergic rhinitis symptoms. It acts as a physical barrier against airborne allergens like pollen, dust mites, and pet dander.  Peppermint powder adds a soothing effect and may help clear airways.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Medical device (nasal powder spray).
- **Mechanism of Action:** HPMC absorbs moisture and creates a gel-like barrier on the nasal mucosa, trapping allergens. Peppermint powder provides a cooling sensation and may offer symptomatic relief from nasal congestion and irritation.

## **Alternate Names**

- Nezact Powder Nasal Spray
- Nasaleze Allergy Blocker
- NASAVAL Allergy Blocker

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** HPMC forms a physical barrier in the nasal passages, preventing allergens from reaching the nasal mucosa. Peppermint powder may have mild anti-inflammatory and decongestant properties, providing additional symptomatic relief.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** HPMC is not absorbed systemically.  It is eliminated through normal nasal clearance mechanisms.  Peppermint powder's volatile components may be partially absorbed through the nasal mucosa but systemic effects are minimal.  
- **Mode of Action:**  Creates a physical barrier that traps allergens.  The peppermint oil in peppermint powder may cause mild vasodilation of nasal blood vessels leading to a sensation of improved airflow.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**  Not applicable.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily through nasal clearance.
