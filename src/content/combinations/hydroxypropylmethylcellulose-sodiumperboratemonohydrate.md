## **Usage**

Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose + sodium perborate monohydrate is prescribed for the temporary relief of burning, irritation, and discomfort associated with dry eye syndrome.  This can be caused by decreased tear production or increased tear evaporation due to environmental factors like wind and sun exposure.  It is also used to alleviate similar symptoms caused by eye irritation. This combination medication falls under the pharmacological classification of **ocular lubricants and artificial tears**.

The mechanism of action involves two components:

* **Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC):** This acts as a lubricant, mimicking natural tears. It forms a protective film over the cornea, helping to retain moisture and reduce friction.
* **Sodium perborate monohydrate:** This component acts as an antiseptic and also releases oxygen upon contact with the eye. This contributes to cleansing, reducing irritation, and providing antimicrobial action.

## **Alternate Names**

* Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) + Sodium perborate monohydrate
* Sodium perborate + Hypromellose
* Hypromellose + sodium perborate

Some brand names include:

* Ducira Gel
* Moisol-Z Eye Drops
* ACRYTEAR
* Retentio Eye Drops
* Extralube Eye Gel (contains HPMC but as a single ingredient preparation)
* Teargrip (contains HPMC and sodium perborate)



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** HPMC increases tear film viscosity, reduces tear evaporation, and lubricates the ocular surface. Sodium perborate provides a mild antiseptic action by releasing oxygen, which helps cleanse the eye and may exert anti-inflammatory effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Primarily local to the ocular surface with minimal systemic absorption.
* **Metabolism:** Sodium perborate decomposes into oxygen and water upon contact with the eye. HPMC is not significantly metabolized in the eye.
* **Elimination:** Excess medication is eliminated through blinking and tear drainage.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Instill 1-2 drops in the affected eye(s) as needed, or as directed by an ophthalmologist.

#### **Children:**  Use in children should be under the guidance of a healthcare provider, who will determine the appropriate dosage based on the child's age and the severity of the dry eye condition.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically necessary. However, close monitoring for potential side effects is recommended.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Patients with glaucoma, high blood pressure, diabetes, existing eye infections or injuries, hyperthyroidism, or heart, kidney, or liver problems should use this medication with caution and under close medical supervision.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication is primarily used for managing dry eye symptoms. It is not typically used for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU care, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are not typically necessary for renal or hepatic impairment. However, individual patient factors and comorbid conditions may necessitate adjustments as directed by a physician.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Blurred vision (temporary)
* Eye irritation or redness
* Stinging or burning sensation upon instillation
* Sticky eyelashes
* Watery eyes


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (e.g., itching, rash, swelling around the eyes)

### **Long-Term Effects:**  No specific long-term adverse effects have been reported.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** Severe allergic reactions should be treated as a medical emergency.


## **Contraindications**

* Known hypersensitivity to any of the components.
* Severe eye infections or injuries.


## **Drug Interactions**

It is recommended to wait 10–15 minutes between applications of different eye medications. Consult a doctor if using other ophthalmic medications concurrently.  While no significant drug-drug interactions are known, inform your doctor of all medications being used.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult a physician before using during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Safety in these populations has not been definitively established.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** HPMC lubricates, and sodium perborate acts as a mild antiseptic and cleansing agent.
