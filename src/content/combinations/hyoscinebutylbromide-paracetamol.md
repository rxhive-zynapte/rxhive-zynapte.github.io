## **Usage**

Hyoscine butylbromide + Paracetamol is prescribed for the relief of pain associated with abdominal cramps or spasms, including menstrual cramps and urinary tract spasms.  It is also effective for other types of smooth muscle spasms in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. This medication combines an antispasmodic and an analgesic agent.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Hyoscine butylbromide: Antispasmodic, Anticholinergic
* Paracetamol: Analgesic, Antipyretic

**Mechanism of Action:**

Hyoscine butylbromide acts as an antispasmodic by competitively antagonizing the muscarinic M3 receptors located on the smooth muscle cells of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. This inhibits the binding of acetylcholine, thus reducing smooth muscle contractions and relieving spasms.  Paracetamol provides pain relief through its analgesic properties, primarily by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the central nervous system, which reduces prostaglandin synthesis and subsequently reduces pain signals.  The combination of these two agents offers dual-action relief â€“ reduction of spasms and pain relief.


## **Alternate Names**

Hyoscine butylbromide is sometimes referred to as Butylscopolamine or Scopolamine butylbromide.

**Brand Names:**  Buscopan Plus, Buscopan Venus, Spasmodex-P


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

Hyoscine butylbromide targets the muscarinic M3 receptors in the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal, biliary, and urinary tracts. Its anticholinergic action reduces smooth muscle tone and peristaltic activity, relieving spasms and cramps. Paracetamol's primary mechanism is thought to be central inhibition of COX enzymes, which are involved in the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins mediate pain and inflammation, so reducing their synthesis leads to pain relief. Paracetamol also has antipyretic effects, but its mechanism for this is not fully understood.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Hyoscine butylbromide is poorly absorbed after oral administration, with bioavailability around 8%. Paracetamol is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 30-60 minutes.
* **Metabolism:** Hyoscine butylbromide undergoes some metabolism in the liver.  Paracetamol is primarily metabolized in the liver through glucuronidation and sulfation pathways. A small amount is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes to a reactive metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), which is usually detoxified by glutathione.
* **Elimination:** Hyoscine butylbromide is primarily eliminated in the feces. Paracetamol is mainly excreted in the urine, primarily as conjugated metabolites.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The recommended dose is 1-2 tablets, three times daily. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 6 tablets.  Tablets should be swallowed whole with sufficient water. Do not chew the tablets. It should not be taken for more than 3 days without a prescription.



#### **Children:**

This combination is not recommended for children under 10 years of age. For children 10 years and older, consult a physician for appropriate dosing recommendations.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Elderly patients should be monitored for potential anticholinergic side effects such as constipation, dry mouth, and urinary retention.  Dosage adjustment may be necessary.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction or increased dosing intervals may be required for patients with severe renal dysfunction.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction or increased dosing intervals may be required for patients with severe hepatic impairment. The drug should not be taken in the event of severe hepatocellular insufficiency.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, tachyarrhythmias, or gastrointestinal or urinary tract obstructions.



### **Clinical Use Cases**  The primary use case of this drug combination is to provide symptomatic relief of pain from spasms in abdominal cramps and urinary tract issues.  It is not typically used as part of specific protocols for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use.  For emergency situations, other medications are generally preferred.


### **Dosage Adjustments**  Dosage adjustment is needed in patients with liver or kidney disease, based on the severity of impairment.  A lower dose or longer intervals between doses may be recommended. This medication should be discontinued if severe liver or kidney function disorders arise.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, difficulty urinating, dizziness, drowsiness, skin reactions (rash, itching).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema), rapid heart rate, acute glaucoma, paralytic ileus, hepatotoxicity (with paracetamol overdose).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic use of paracetamol, particularly at high doses, can lead to liver damage. Long-term use of hyoscine butylbromide is not recommended without medical supervision due to the risk of developing tolerance and potential anticholinergic side effects.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** Any severe allergic reaction, including difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, or any signs of hepatotoxicity, requires immediate medical attention.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to hyoscine butylbromide or paracetamol.
* Myasthenia gravis.
* Mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction (e.g., pyloric stenosis, achalasia).
* Paralytic ileus or megacolon.
* Closed-angle glaucoma.
* Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).
* Tachyarrhythmias.
* Urinary retention (e.g., due to prostatic hypertrophy).



## **Drug Interactions**

* **Anticholinergics:**  Concomitant use of other anticholinergic medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, antihistamines) may potentiate anticholinergic effects.
* **Metoclopramide and other Prokinetics:**  May antagonize the effects of both drugs on the gastrointestinal tract.
* **Beta-adrenergic agonists:** Hyoscine butylbromide may enhance the tachycardic effects.
* **CYP450 inducers/inhibitors:** Certain drugs, such as rifampicin and phenytoin, may affect the metabolism of both drugs.
* **Alcohol:**  May increase the risk of paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity.
* **Anticoagulants:**  Chronic paracetamol use may necessitate monitoring of anticoagulant therapy.
* **Zidovudine:** May increase the risk of neutropenia.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Hyoscine butylbromide + Paracetamol is generally not recommended during pregnancy, especially the first trimester, due to potential risks to the fetus.  Paracetamol is considered relatively safe for occasional use during pregnancy at recommended doses. However, prolonged use or high doses are discouraged.  Hyoscine butylbromide's safety during pregnancy is not well established, so the combination is best avoided.


Paracetamol is excreted in breast milk. While generally considered safe for breastfeeding, prolonged use or high doses should be avoided. Hyoscine butylbromide's excretion into breast milk is not well studied.  Therefore, it's advisable to exercise caution when using this combination during breastfeeding or consider alternate options.
