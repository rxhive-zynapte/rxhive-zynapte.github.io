## **Usage**

Ibuprofen + Mefenamic Acid is a combination of two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) primarily used for pain relief, particularly in conditions like dysmenorrhea (menstrual pain) where a stronger analgesic effect is desired.  It is prescribed for mild to moderate pain, including headache, dental pain, post-operative pain, and musculoskeletal pain.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Analgesic, Anti-inflammatory, Antipyretic.

**Mechanism of Action:** Both ibuprofen and mefenamic acid inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which are responsible for producing prostaglandins, substances that mediate pain, inflammation, and fever.

## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination. However, the individual components are sometimes referred to by their chemical names:  Ibuprofen: isobutylphenyl propionic acid and  Mefenamic Acid: N-2,3-xylylanthranilic acid.  Brand names for combination products may vary depending on the region.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Both drugs exert their analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects through COX inhibition, reducing prostaglandin synthesis.  Ibuprofen is a non-selective COX inhibitor, while mefenamic acid preferentially inhibits COX-2.  This combined action results in a synergistic effect on pain and inflammation reduction.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:** Both drugs are well-absorbed orally.
* **Metabolism:** Ibuprofen is primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP2C9 enzymes. Mefenamic acid undergoes hepatic metabolism as well.
* **Elimination:**  Ibuprofen metabolites and mefenamic acid are primarily excreted via the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** Ibuprofen and mefenamic acid bind to COX enzymes, preventing the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. This inhibition reduces the inflammatory response and diminishes pain signaling.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**  
#### **Adults:**

The recommended dose for Ibuprofen is typically between 400 mg every 4-6 hours, while the recommended dose for Mefenamic Acid is typically 500 mg every 6-8 hours. These drugs should be taken with food to minimize gastrointestinal side effects.

#### **Children:**

The combination is generally not recommended for children under 14 years of age unless under the explicit direction of a physician.



#### **Special Cases:**  
* **Elderly Patients** and **Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment**: Close monitoring is essential, and dose reductions may be necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  
The combination is not typically used in the specific clinical settings of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Other analgesics are preferred in these situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**  
Dose adjustments are required for patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, based on their individual conditions.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
* Gastrointestinal issues: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain.
* Dizziness, headache.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration.
* Renal impairment.
* Cardiovascular events (e.g., heart attack, stroke) with prolonged use.
* Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., skin rash, itching, angioedema).
* Hemolytic anemia (mefenamic acid).

### **Long-Term Effects**
Chronic kidney disease, gastrointestinal ulceration, and cardiovascular complications can occur with extended high-dose use.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to ibuprofen or mefenamic acid.
* History of asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.
* Active gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration.
* Severe heart failure, hepatic impairment, or renal impairment.
* Third trimester of pregnancy.
* Perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

## **Drug Interactions**

* Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin): Increased bleeding risk.
* Antihypertensives (e.g., ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers): Reduced antihypertensive effect.
* Lithium: Increased lithium levels.
* Methotrexate: Increased methotrexate toxicity.
* Other NSAIDs: Increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects.
* Corticosteroids: Increased risk of gastrointestinal ulceration.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* Pregnancy: Use with caution during the first and second trimesters. Contraindicated in the third trimester. Mefenamic acid is generally not recommended during pregnancy.
* Breastfeeding: Ibuprofen is considered compatible with breastfeeding. Mefenamic acid should be avoided due to potential risks for the infant.

## **Drug Profile Summary**
* **Mechanism of Action:** COX inhibition, reducing prostaglandin synthesis.
* **Side Effects:** GI issues, dizziness, headache. Serious effects: GI bleeding, renal/hepatic impairment, cardiovascular events.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, GI bleeding/ulcers, severe heart/liver/kidney disease, 3rd-trimester pregnancy, CABG surgery.
* **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, antihypertensives, lithium, methotrexate, other NSAIDs, corticosteroids.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Ibuprofen use with caution in the 1st and 2nd trimesters, contraindicated in 3rd. Mefenamic acid generally avoid in pregnancy. Ibuprofen compatible with breastfeeding; avoid mefenamic acid.
* **Dosage:** Ibuprofen 400 mg every 4-6 hours, mefenamic acid 500 mg every 6-8 hours. Adjust for renal/hepatic issues.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal and liver function, blood pressure, signs of GI bleeding, complete blood count.

## **Popular Combinations**

Not typically used as fixed combinations due to overlapping mechanisms and increased risk of side effects.

## **Precautions**

* Assess renal and hepatic function before and during treatment.
* Monitor for gastrointestinal side effects.
* Caution in patients with cardiovascular risk factors.
* Avoid in patients with asthma or nasal polyps sensitive to aspirin.
* Use lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible.
