## Usage

Ibuprofen + Paracetamol is prescribed for the short-term relief of mild to moderate pain and fever associated with conditions such as headache, migraine, backache, period pain, dental pain, musculoskeletal pain, pain from non-serious arthritis, cold and flu symptoms, and sore throat.  It is indicated when paracetamol or ibuprofen alone do not provide sufficient pain relief.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Analgesic (pain reliever) and Antipyretic (fever reducer). Ibuprofen is also a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID).

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination exerts its analgesic and antipyretic effects through distinct yet complementary mechanisms.  Ibuprofen, an NSAID, inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, key mediators of pain and inflammation.  Paracetamol's mechanism is not fully elucidated but is thought to involve central COX inhibition, with possible serotonergic and endocannabinoid system involvement.

## Alternate Names

This combination is often referred to as Paracetamol/Ibuprofen or Ibuprofen/Paracetamol. 

**Brand Names:**  Examples include Nuromol and Maxigesic. Several generic versions also exist.

## How It Works

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ibuprofen reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, thus decreasing prostaglandin production. Paracetamol's central action on COX enzymes, possibly including COX-3, leads to reduced pain and fever.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Both drugs are well-absorbed orally. Ibuprofen is metabolized primarily by CYP2C9 enzymes in the liver, while paracetamol is mainly glucuronidated and sulfated.  Both are eliminated predominantly through renal excretion.

**Mode of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Ibuprofen's primary mechanism is COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme inhibition. Paracetamol's precise mechanism is complex and not fully understood but is thought to involve inhibition of central COX enzymes and modulation of endocannabinoid and serotonergic pathways.

**Elimination Pathways:** Both ibuprofen and paracetamol are primarily eliminated via renal excretion of metabolites.

## Dosage

### Standard Dosage

#### Adults (Under 65 years):

* One or two tablets every 6-8 hours as needed.
* Maximum: 6 tablets (containing 200mg Ibuprofen/500mg Paracetamol per tablet) in 24 hours or 8 tablets (containing 150mg Ibuprofen/500mg Paracetamol per tablet) in 24 hours. Do not exceed a combined daily dose of 2400mg ibuprofen and 4000mg paracetamol.
* Treatment duration should not exceed 3 days without medical supervision.

#### Children:

* Not recommended for children under 12 years old.
* Adolescents (12-17 years):  Same as adult dose, but treatment should not exceed 2 days without medical supervision.

#### Special Cases:

* **Elderly Patients (65 years and over):** Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.  Consider comorbidities and co-medications.  Consult a physician before use.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dose adjustment may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dose adjustment may be necessary. Avoid in severe hepatic impairment.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with asthma, peptic ulcer disease, heart failure, hypertension, coagulation defects, or other chronic conditions.

### Clinical Use Cases

This combination is generally not used for these purposes. Other medications are better suited for the management of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and other emergencies. This combination is indicated for relief of mild-to-moderate pain, not severe or acute pain, such as would be experienced in surgical or emergency settings.

### Dosage Adjustments

Dosage adjustments may be needed for elderly patients, those with renal or hepatic impairment, and those with other relevant comorbidities.  Consult a doctor for individualised recommendations.

## Side Effects

### Common Side Effects

* Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain).
* Headache, dizziness.
* Rash, itching.


### Rare but Serious Side Effects

* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema).
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration.
* Liver damage (especially with high doses of paracetamol).
* Kidney problems.
* Cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke) with prolonged use of ibuprofen.

### Long-Term Effects

* Potential for gastrointestinal complications, kidney problems, and cardiovascular events with chronic ibuprofen use.
* Liver damage with chronic paracetamol overuse.
* Medication overuse headache.

### Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)

Clinically significant ADRs require immediate discontinuation of the drug and medical attention. These include severe allergic reactions, gastrointestinal bleeding, signs of liver toxicity (jaundice, abdominal pain), and cardiovascular events.


## Contraindications

* Hypersensitivity to paracetamol, ibuprofen, or other NSAIDs.
* Severe heart failure (NYHA Class IV).
* Active peptic ulcer disease.
* Active alcoholism.
* Severe hepatic impairment.
* Third trimester of pregnancy.
* Asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.
* Concomitant use with other NSAIDs.

## Drug Interactions

* Anticoagulants (warfarin): Increased risk of bleeding.
* Antihypertensives: May reduce the effectiveness of these drugs.
* Lithium: May increase lithium levels.
* Methotrexate: Increased risk of methotrexate toxicity.
* Corticosteroids: Increased risk of gastrointestinal ulcers.
* CYP2C9 inhibitors and inducers: May affect ibuprofen metabolism.


## Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

* **Pregnancy:** Avoid during the third trimester. Use with caution during the first and second trimesters.
* **Breastfeeding:** Small amounts of both drugs are excreted in breast milk. Generally considered compatible with breastfeeding, but use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.

## Drug Profile Summary

* **Mechanism of Action:** Ibuprofen inhibits COX enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis. Paracetamol's mechanism involves central COX inhibition with possible serotonergic and endocannabinoid system involvement.
* **Side Effects:**  Gastrointestinal upset, headache, dizziness, rash, itching (common).  Allergic reactions, gastrointestinal bleeding, liver damage, cardiovascular events (rare but serious).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe heart failure, active peptic ulcer, severe liver disease, third-trimester pregnancy, aspirin/NSAID sensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, antihypertensives, lithium, methotrexate, corticosteroids.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid during the third trimester of pregnancy. Generally compatible with breastfeeding but use cautiously.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 1-2 tablets every 6-8 hours, maximum 6 tablets/day or 8 tablets/day depending on formulation. Children (12-17 years): Same as adult dose, maximum 2 days' treatment. Elderly: Lowest effective dose, shortest duration.

## Popular Combinations

While this medication combines paracetamol and ibuprofen, it is sometimes used in conjunction with other analgesics, such as codeine or opioids, for more severe pain, but only under strict medical supervision.

## Precautions

* **General Precautions:** Screen for allergies, pre-existing medical conditions (especially renal or hepatic impairment, cardiovascular disease), and concomitant medications.

* **Specific Populations:** See "Dosage - Special Cases" and "Pregnancy and Breastfeeding."
