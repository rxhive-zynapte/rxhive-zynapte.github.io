## **Usage**

Ibuprofen + Pseudoephedrine is prescribed for the temporary relief of symptoms associated with the common cold or flu, including headache, sinus pressure, nasal congestion, minor body aches and pains, and fever.

It is pharmacologically classified as a combination drug containing a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) and a nasal decongestant.  

Ibuprofen works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin production, which are mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. Pseudoephedrine acts as a sympathomimetic amine, constricting blood vessels in the nasal mucosa, thus relieving congestion.


## **Alternate Names**

While the generic name is Ibuprofen + Pseudoephedrine, this combination is marketed under various brand names, some of which include Advil Cold & Sinus, Motrin IB Sinus, and Sudafed Sinus Pressure & Pain.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ibuprofen exerts its analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, decreasing prostaglandin synthesis. Pseudoephedrine acts on alpha-adrenergic receptors in the nasal mucosa, causing vasoconstriction, thereby reducing nasal congestion.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Ibuprofen is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1-2 hours. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily by the kidneys. Pseudoephedrine is also readily absorbed orally and is partially metabolized in the liver, with the majority excreted unchanged in the urine.


**Mode of Action:** Ibuprofen acts by non-selectively inhibiting both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. This leads to a decrease in the formation of prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and prostacyclins. By reducing prostaglandins, ibuprofen diminishes pain and inflammation. It lowers fever by inhibiting prostaglandin E2 synthesis within the hypothalamus. Pseudoephedrine stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors in the respiratory tract, leading to vasoconstriction and reduced mucosal edema, which helps to relieve nasal congestion.

**Elimination Pathways:** Ibuprofen is primarily eliminated via renal excretion following hepatic metabolism. Pseudoephedrine is mainly eliminated via renal excretion, with a small amount undergoing hepatic metabolism.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 1-2 tablets/capsules (200mg ibuprofen/30mg pseudoephedrine) every 4-6 hours as needed. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 6 tablets/capsules.

#### **Children:** This medication is not recommended for children under 12 years old. For children 12 years and older, the adult dosage applies.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**:  Start with the lowest effective dose and monitor closely for adverse events.  Consider dose reduction.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Use with caution. Dosage adjustments may be necessary. Close monitoring is recommended. Avoid in severe renal impairment.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Use with caution. Dose adjustments may be needed.  Avoid use in severe hepatic impairment.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Exercise caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, or other conditions that might be exacerbated by the drug's effects. Closely monitor these patients.



### **Clinical Use Cases**  The medication is typically used for symptomatic relief of the common cold and flu and therefore is generally not indicated for use in the scenarios you mentioned (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, Emergency Situations).


### **Dosage Adjustments** 

Dosage adjustment should be considered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Elderly patients may also require dosage adjustment.





## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, dizziness, nervousness, insomnia, dry mouth.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (e.g., hives, facial swelling, difficulty breathing), gastrointestinal bleeding,  increased risk of heart attack or stroke, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular complications with long-term or excessive use.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, gastrointestinal bleeding/perforation, myocardial infarction, stroke, hepatotoxicity, acute renal failure.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to ibuprofen or pseudoephedrine, history of severe allergic reaction to aspirin or other NSAIDs, recent or upcoming coronary artery bypass graft surgery, severe renal or hepatic impairment, uncontrolled hypertension, pregnant women in the third trimester, breastfeeding women. Concurrent use of MAOIs.


## **Drug Interactions**

MAOIs, aspirin (high doses), other NSAIDs, anticoagulants, lithium, methotrexate, digoxin, antihypertensives, certain antidepressants (SSRIs, tricyclics), alcohol, tobacco.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Ibuprofen + Pseudoephedrine is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy and during breastfeeding. Its use in earlier stages of pregnancy should be discussed with a healthcare professional.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Ibuprofen inhibits COX enzymes, reducing prostaglandins. Pseudoephedrine is an alpha-adrenergic agonist, causing nasal vasoconstriction.
