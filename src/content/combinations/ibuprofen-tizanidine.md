## **Usage**

Ibuprofen + Tizanidine is prescribed for the management of acute muscle spasms associated with low back pain, neck pain, and muscle strains.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This combination includes a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) - Ibuprofen, and a skeletal muscle relaxant - Tizanidine.

**Mechanism of Action:** Ibuprofen reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Tizanidine acts as a centrally acting alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, reducing spasticity by increasing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons in the spinal cord.

## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination. Brand names may vary regionally; some examples include Mialgilox.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ibuprofen exerts analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thus reducing prostaglandin production. Tizanidine primarily acts on alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the central nervous system, leading to a decrease in excitatory amino acid release and reduced muscle tone.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Ibuprofen is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1-2 hours. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily by the kidneys. Tizanidine is also readily absorbed orally, with peak plasma levels achieved in approximately 1 hour.  It is extensively metabolized in the liver, mainly by CYP1A2, and eliminated through renal excretion.

**Mode of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Ibuprofen inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. Tizanidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, binding to these receptors in the central nervous system to reduce neuronal excitability and muscle spasticity.

**Elimination Pathways:** Ibuprofen undergoes hepatic metabolism and is primarily eliminated through renal excretion. Tizanidine is extensively metabolized in the liver, predominantly by CYP1A2, and excreted by the kidneys.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The starting dose of Tizanidine is typically 2 mg every 6-8 hours, as needed, with a maximum of three doses (36mg maximum) in 24 hours. Ibuprofen is typically dosed at 400-800 mg every 4-6 hours as needed, not exceeding 3200mg/day. These medications can be taken with or without food, but consistency is advised. Dosage should be individualized according to the patient's response and tolerability.

#### **Children:**

The combination of Ibuprofen and Tizanidine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 16 years of age. Ibuprofen pediatric dosing is weight-based, and Tizanidine usage in children needs to be determined by a doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses of both medications and titrate cautiously, monitoring for adverse effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduced doses of both ibuprofen and tizanidine are recommended in patients with renal insufficiency. Individual doses should be reduced during titration.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Tizanidine should be used with caution due to potential hepatotoxicity.  Individual doses should be reduced during titration.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and gastrointestinal issues.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Ibuprofen + Tizanidine is not typically indicated for use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary indication is for muscle spasm and pain relief.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, the elderly, and individuals with certain comorbidities.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, fatigue, nausea, hypotension, gastrointestinal upset.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Hepatotoxicity (liver damage), allergic reactions, blood pressure changes, hallucinations, seizures.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration (with ibuprofen), liver function abnormalities (with tizanidine).


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (rare but serious skin reaction), severe hypotension, hepatotoxicity, acute renal failure.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to ibuprofen or tizanidine, active peptic ulcer disease, severe hepatic or renal impairment, pregnancy (especially after 30 weeks), breastfeeding. Concurrent use with ciprofloxacin.

## **Drug Interactions**

Significant interactions may occur with alcohol, other CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids), antihypertensives, CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin), and other NSAIDs.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

This combination is contraindicated during pregnancy, particularly after 30 weeks, and is not recommended during breastfeeding due to potential risks to the fetus or infant.

## **Popular Combinations**

This combination itself is prescribed, though tizanidine may be used in combination with other NSAIDs for similar indications.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Monitor patients for hepatotoxicity, hypotension, and gastrointestinal issues.
* **Specific Populations:**  Use with caution in the elderly and individuals with renal or hepatic impairment. Avoid in pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid alcohol while taking this combination, as it can increase the risk of side effects.  Caution when driving or operating machinery due to potential drowsiness.
