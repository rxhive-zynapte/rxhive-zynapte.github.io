## **Usage**

Ifosfamide, in combination with Mesna, is prescribed for the treatment of various cancers, including:

*   Germ cell testicular cancer (third-line treatment in combination with other antineoplastic agents)
*   Soft tissue sarcomas
*   Advanced or recurrent cervical cancer
*   Relapsed or refractory pancreatic cancer

Ifosfamide is classified as an alkylating antineoplastic agent. Mesna is a chemoprotectant specifically used to prevent ifosfamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis.

Ifosfamide's mechanism of action involves its activation in the liver to metabolites that alkylate DNA, leading to DNA cross-linking and hindering DNA replication and transcription, ultimately resulting in cell death. Mesna binds to and detoxifies acrolein, a toxic metabolite of ifosfamide responsible for hemorrhagic cystitis.

## **Alternate Names**

Ifosfamide is also known as ifosfamidum.  Mesna is also known as sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate.

Brand names for Ifosfamide include Ifex®. Brand names for Mesna include Mesnex®.  Ifosfamide is often administered with Mesna, but there are no brand names for the combination product.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics (Ifosfamide):** Ifosfamide itself is inactive and requires hepatic activation to form alkylating metabolites that disrupt DNA function, leading to cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics (Ifosfamide):**

*   **Absorption:**  Administered intravenously.
*   **Metabolism:** Hepatically activated.
*   **Elimination:** Renally excreted.

**Pharmacodynamics (Mesna):** Mesna binds to and inactivates acrolein in the urinary bladder, thereby preventing hemorrhagic cystitis.

**Pharmacokinetics (Mesna):**

*   **Absorption:** Administered intravenously or orally.
*   **Metabolism:** Hepatically metabolized to dimesna.
*   **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion.

**Mode of Action (Ifosfamide):** Ifosfamide metabolites cause DNA cross-linking, primarily at the N7 position of guanine. This inhibits DNA replication and transcription, inducing apoptosis and cell death.

**Elimination Pathways (Ifosfamide):** Ifosfamide is predominantly eliminated via renal excretion.

**Elimination Pathways (Mesna):** Mesna is primarily renally excreted, both as the parent compound and its disulfide metabolite, dimesna.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Ifosfamide: 1.2 g/m² IV daily for 5 consecutive days, repeated every 3 weeks or after hematologic recovery.  Other regimens use higher doses over fewer days.
Mesna: Dosage is dependent on ifosfamide dose.  Commonly, Mesna is administered at a dose equivalent to 20% of the ifosfamide dose IV bolus at time of ifosfamide administration, followed by oral Mesna at a dose equivalent to 40% of the ifosfamide dose at 2 and 6 hours following ifosfamide administration.
The patient should be well hydrated and maintain a fluid balance.
Administration of Ifosfamide must be done by slow IV infusion over at least 30 minutes.

#### **Children:**

Dosing should be based on body surface area (BSA) and adjusted according to specific protocols.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments are based on renal function and overall health status.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is necessary.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Close monitoring for toxicity is necessary.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized dosing adjustments based on the specific comorbid conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing is generally consistent across different clinical settings and is determined by the underlying malignancy, patient-specific factors, and concurrent therapies.  Refer to specific protocols and guidelines for detailed instructions.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are necessary based on hematologic toxicity, renal function, hepatic function, and other patient-specific factors.

## **Side Effects**
