## **Usage**

Ilaprazole + Levosulpiride is prescribed for the short-term treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), acidity, indigestion, heartburn, peptic ulcers (gastric and duodenal), functional dyspepsia, and other peptic disorders. It is particularly beneficial for patients who do not respond adequately to proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) alone.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Ilaprazole: Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI)
* Levosulpiride: Prokinetic agent, atypical antipsychotic

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination medication addresses both acid production and gut motility. Ilaprazole suppresses gastric acid secretion, while Levosulpiride promotes faster emptying of the stomach.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is marketed under various brand names like Iladac L, Blockcid L, and Ilapil LS.  International and regional variations of the name may exist.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ilaprazole irreversibly binds to the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme (proton pump) in the parietal cells of the stomach, reducing gastric acid secretion. Levosulpiride is a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, increasing acetylcholine release in the GI tract, which enhances gut motility and accelerates gastric emptying.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Ilaprazole:**  Metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 enzymes.
* **Levosulpiride:** Metabolized in the liver. Elimination pathways for both drugs are primarily hepatic, though some renal excretion may occur.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** One capsule/tablet of Ilaprazole (10mg) + Levosulpiride (75mg) orally, preferably one hour before a meal, usually in the morning. The treatment duration depends on the patient's response and clinical condition, as determined by the physician.

#### **Children:** Generally not recommended for children under 14 years old due to limited safety and efficacy data.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to increased risk of side effects (e.g., elevated prolactin levels, bone fractures). Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Exercise caution. Dose adjustment may be needed based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dose adjustments may be necessary due to impaired metabolism.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Evaluate carefully, especially in patients with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal obstruction, osteoporosis, hypomagnesemia, pheochromocytoma, epilepsy, mania, or *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific clinical settings (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, emergency situations) should be individualized based on patient needs and should adhere to standard adult dosing with adjustments as needed.  There are no fixed protocols using Ilaprazole + Levosulpiride in these settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage modification should be considered based on individual patient characteristics like renal/hepatic function, other metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism. Always prioritize patient safety and tailor the dosage accordingly.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Headache, nausea, vomiting, gas, dry mouth, dizziness, diarrhea, fatigue.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS), tardive dyskinesia, hyperprolactinemia (especially with Levosulpiride).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Osteoporosis, hypomagnesemia, vitamin B12 deficiency (with long-term PPI use).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any signs of NMS (fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status), severe EPS, or allergic reactions require immediate medical attention.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to either drug, gastrointestinal hemorrhage or mechanical obstruction, prolactin-dependent tumors (e.g., prolactinoma), pheochromocytoma.

## **Drug Interactions**

Ilaprazole can interact with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19.  Levosulpiride can interact with drugs affecting dopamine levels.  Avoid concomitant use with:

* Ketoconazole, Itraconazole, Posaconazole
* Erlotinib
* Warfarin, Phenprocoumon
* Atazanavir
* Methotrexate
* Fluvoxamine
* Rifampicin
* St. John's Wort
* Antipsychotics (e.g., Chlorpromazine, Haloperidol)
* Antidepressants (e.g., Fluoxetine, Sertraline)
* Dopamine agonists (e.g., Levodopa, Bromocriptine)
* Antihypertensives (e.g., Methyldopa, Clonidine)
* Alcohol

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy:** Consult a physician. Use only if the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  Pregnancy Safety Category C (Levosulpiride).

**Breastfeeding:**  The drugs can pass into breast milk. Consult a physician before use.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Ilaprazole reduces gastric acid; Levosulpiride enhances GI motility.
* **Side Effects:** Headache, nausea, dizziness, diarrhea, EPS, NMS (rare).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, GI bleeding, prolactin-dependent tumors.
* **Drug Interactions:** Azole antifungals, Warfarin, Methotrexate, several others.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult a doctor before use.
* **Dosage:** 10mg Ilaprazole + 75mg Levosulpiride once daily before a meal.
