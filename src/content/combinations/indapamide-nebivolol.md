## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the management of hypertension (high blood pressure) in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by monotherapy.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  This is a combination of two antihypertensive drug classes:
    - Nebivolol: Beta-1 adrenergic receptor blocker (beta-blocker).
    - Indapamide: Thiazide-like diuretic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Nebivolol reduces blood pressure by blocking beta-1 receptors in the heart, leading to decreased heart rate and cardiac output. It also appears to cause vasodilation via nitric oxide release. Indapamide lowers blood pressure by increasing the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water from the body through the kidneys.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names for this specific combination exist. However, the individual drugs have various names internationally.
- **Brand Names:**  Numerous brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region, including but not limited to Nebula D, and other regional variations.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Nebivolol exhibits cardioselectivity, predominantly affecting beta-1 receptors with minimal impact on beta-2 receptors at therapeutic doses. It reduces heart rate, cardiac output, and peripheral vascular resistance. Indapamide inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron, increasing urine output and reducing plasma volume.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - **Nebivolol:** Well absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 1.5 to 4 hours. Food does not significantly affect absorption. It is highly protein-bound (98%), primarily to albumin. Metabolized in the liver, primarily via glucuronidation and secondarily by CYP2D6. Both parent drug and metabolites contribute to beta-blocking activity. Elimination half-life is variable, influenced by CYP2D6 metabolism.
    - **Indapamide:** Almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak plasma concentrations reached in about 1 to 2 hours for immediate-release and 12 hours for extended-release formulations. Highly protein-bound (71% to 79%). Extensively metabolized in the liver. Excreted primarily in urine (60% to 70%) and feces (20% to 30%). Half-life ranges from 14 to 18 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Nebivolol selectively antagonizes beta-1 adrenergic receptors, reducing sympathetic stimulation of the heart. Indapamide inhibits sodium reabsorption by blocking the sodium-chloride symporter in the distal tubule.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Nebivolol exhibits high affinity for beta-1 adrenergic receptors. Indapamide interacts with the sodium-chloride symporter.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Nebivolol is mainly eliminated via hepatic metabolism, with some renal excretion. Indapamide is primarily excreted in the urine, with some fecal elimination.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- **Nebivolol:** Initial 5 mg orally once daily, adjusted as needed at 1-2 week intervals up to a maximum of 40 mg/day.
- **Indapamide:** Initial 1.25 mg orally once daily, may be increased to 2.5 mg after 4 weeks, and then to 5 mg after another 4 weeks if needed.  
- **Combination:**  A common starting dose is nebivolol 5 mg/indapamide 1.25 mg once daily, with adjustments made based on the individual patient response. It is typically taken in the morning.  


#### **Children:**  This combination is not recommended for children under 18 years of age as safety and efficacy have not been established.



#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses of both medications and titrate cautiously, considering potential age-related decline in organ function. For nebivolol, a maximum of 5mg per day is recommended for patients older than 65.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** For nebivolol, the initial dose is 2.5 mg once daily for creatinine clearance <30 mL/min. Indapamide should be used with caution, and dose reduction might be necessary. Close monitoring of renal function is advised.  
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** For nebivolol, the initial dose is 2.5 mg once daily for moderate impairment. It is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment. Indapamide should be used with caution, as dose reduction may be required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is essential for individuals with diabetes, gout, or systemic lupus erythematosus. Adjust dosages and monitor closely.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This particular combination is not typically used in acute settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU care, or emergency situations. Its primary indication is the long-term management of hypertension.


### **Dosage Adjustments**
Dosages need to be modified based on individual patient factors like renal or hepatic impairment, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism. Careful monitoring of blood pressure, electrolytes, and renal function is necessary.
