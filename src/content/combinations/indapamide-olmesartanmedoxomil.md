## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** This fixed-dose combination medication is primarily prescribed for the management of essential hypertension (high blood pressure) in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by olmesartan medoxomil or indapamide alone. It can also be used as initial therapy in patients likely to require multiple drugs to achieve blood pressure goals.  It's especially beneficial in patients with type 2 diabetes to prevent microalbuminuria and proteinuria or offer end-organ protection.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antihypertensive (Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker [ARB] + Thiazide-like Diuretic).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Olmesartan medoxomil blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that causes blood vessels to constrict, leading to vasodilation and lowered blood pressure. Indapamide, a thiazide-like diuretic, increases the excretion of sodium and water by the kidneys, further reducing blood volume and blood pressure. The combination provides synergistic antihypertensive effects.

## **Alternate Names**

- There are no widely recognized alternate names for this combination itself. However, the individual components have various names (e.g., for olmesartan medoxomil:  Benicar, Olmetec).
- **Brand Names:**  Brand names vary regionally; examples include Olmesar-ID and Olmecip-ID in India. There are also numerous generic versions containing the same active ingredients.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Olmesartan medoxomil is a prodrug rapidly hydrolyzed to olmesartan, which selectively blocks the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor. This inhibits the vasoconstricting and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II, resulting in vasodilation, decreased peripheral resistance, and reduced blood volume. Indapamide inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule, increasing sodium and water excretion. The combined effect reduces blood volume, decreases peripheral resistance, and lowers blood pressure.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** *Absorption:* Olmesartan medoxomil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations reached in 1-2 hours.  Indapamide is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, achieving peak plasma levels in 1-2 hours as well.  *Metabolism:* Olmesartan medoxomil undergoes rapid and complete hydrolysis to olmesartan, the active metabolite.  Olmesartan is not further metabolized. Indapamide is partially metabolized in the liver. *Elimination:* Olmesartan is primarily eliminated in feces and urine with a half-life of 13 hours. Indapamide is excreted mainly by the kidneys with a half-life of approximately 18 hours.

- **Mode of Action:** Olmesartan exerts its effect by competitively binding to the AT1 receptor, preventing angiotensin II from binding and triggering vasoconstriction. Indapamide acts by inhibiting the sodium-chloride cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule, thus impeding sodium reabsorption.  Neither drug significantly affects CYP enzymes.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
The usual recommended starting dose is one tablet containing 20 mg olmesartan medoxomil and 1.25 mg indapamide once daily. After 1-2 weeks, the dose may be increased to one tablet containing 40 mg olmesartan medoxomil and 1.25 mg indapamide once daily as needed.

#### **Children:**

Olmesartan medoxomil monotherapy is approved for pediatric use, but the combination with indapamide is not typically recommended for children.

#### **Special Cases:**
* **Elderly Patients:** No initial dosage adjustment is generally required. Close monitoring is advised, especially in those with volume depletion or concurrent illnesses.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Use cautiously. Closely monitor renal function and serum electrolytes. Dosage adjustment may be necessary based on creatinine clearance. In severe renal impairment, consider a lower initial dose and a maximum dose not exceeding 20 mg of olmesartan medoxomil with 1.25 mg indapamide.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use cautiously. Closely monitor liver function tests and serum electrolytes. No initial dosage adjustment is generally required, but reduce dosage in severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** In patients with conditions like diabetes, heart failure, and other cardiovascular diseases, dose adjustments should be made based on individual needs and under careful medical supervision.


### **Clinical Use Cases**
