## **Usage**

- Insulin Aspart + Insulin Aspart Protamine is prescribed for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycemic control.  It is particularly useful in cases where oral antidiabetic agents or other insulin regimens do not provide adequate control.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Rapid-acting and intermediate-acting insulin combination, antidiabetic agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination mimics the physiological release of insulin. The insulin aspart component rapidly controls postprandial glucose excursions, while the insulin aspart protamine provides a sustained basal insulin level. Both components work by binding to insulin receptors, facilitating glucose uptake into cells and glycogen synthesis, thus lowering blood glucose levels.

## **Alternate Names**

-  While "Insulin Aspart + Insulin Aspart Protamine" is the generic name, regional or international variations may exist.
- **Brand Name:** NovoLog Mix 70/30 (70% protamine aspart, 30% aspart).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Insulin Aspart, a rapid-acting insulin analog, starts working within 10-20 minutes, peaks in 1-3 hours, and lasts for 3-5 hours. Insulin Aspart Protamine, an intermediate-acting insulin analog, starts working within 1-2 hours, with a less pronounced peak, and lasts for 14-16 hours. Together, they provide both prandial and basal insulin coverage.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Absorption: Subcutaneous injection. Aspart absorbs faster than regular human insulin due to amino acid modifications. Protamine delays the absorption of aspart.
    - Metabolism: Primarily in the liver, kidneys, and adipose tissues, similar to human insulin.
    - Elimination: Primarily renal and hepatic. The elimination half-life of aspart is approximately 81 minutes, and for faster-acting aspart, around 66 minutes.
- **Mode of Action:** Both components bind to insulin receptors, triggering intracellular signaling cascades promoting glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis.
- Receptor binding:  Binds to insulin receptors on cell surfaces.
- No direct enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation.
- Elimination is through hepatic and renal pathways.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Type 1 Diabetes:**  0.5-1 unit/kg/day, split into twice-daily doses.
- **Type 2 Diabetes:**  Initial dose of 6 units twice daily or 12 units once daily before the biggest meal. Adjust based on self-monitored blood glucose levels and glycemic targets.

#### **Children (â‰¥10 years):**

- Similar to adult dosing.
- Children (6-9 years): Limited data available; use with caution.
- **Pediatric Safety:**  Closely monitor for hypoglycemia. Dosage adjustments are essential based on growth spurts and puberty.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with conservative doses and adjust cautiously to prevent hypoglycemia which can be difficult to recognize in the elderly.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be required due to altered insulin clearance. Frequent blood glucose monitoring essential.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary due to impaired insulin metabolism.  Close monitoring is crucial.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider the impact of co-existing conditions on glucose control and insulin requirements.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use:** Dosage adjustments may be needed depending on patient condition and nutritional status. Continuous glucose monitoring and frequent dose adjustments are important in these settings.
- **Emergency Situations (e.g., Diabetic Ketoacidosis):** NovoLog Mix 70/30 is NOT recommended for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Intravenous regular insulin is preferred in such cases.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments based on patient-specific factors, including renal/hepatic dysfunction, other illnesses, lifestyle changes, and concomitant medications. Regular blood glucose monitoring is essential to guide dosage adjustments.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
- Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling)
- Weight gain


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Severe hypoglycemia
- Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing, swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat)
- Hypokalaemia (low potassium)


### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Lipodystrophy (changes in fat tissue at injection site)


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Severe hypoglycemia
- Anaphylaxis


## **Contraindications**

- Hypoglycemia
- Hypersensitivity to insulin aspart or any of the components of NovoLog Mix 70/30.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Other antidiabetic agents (oral or injectable): Increased risk of hypoglycemia.
- Medications that can affect blood glucose levels (e.g., corticosteroids, thiazides, atypical antipsychotics): May require dosage adjustments.
- Beta-blockers: Can mask symptoms of hypoglycemia.
- Alcohol: Can potentiate the hypoglycemic effects.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Category B:** Animal studies have not shown adverse effects; however, human data are limited.  Insulin is the preferred agent for managing diabetes during pregnancy. Monitor blood glucose closely.
- **Breastfeeding:** Insulin aspart is present in breast milk, but amounts are considered insignificant. Dosage adjustments may be required for breastfeeding mothers.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Mimics physiological insulin release, enhances glucose uptake and utilization.
- **Side Effects:** Hypoglycemia, injection site reactions, weight gain.
- **Contraindications:** Hypoglycemia, hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:** Other antidiabetic agents, beta-blockers, alcohol.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Can be used with monitoring; insulin is generally preferred in pregnancy.
- **Dosage:** Individualized, 0.5-1 unit/kg/day for Type 1, starting dose of 6 units BID or 12 units QD for Type 2, adjust based on blood glucose levels.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood glucose, HbA1c, weight, potassium levels.


## **Popular Combinations**

- Metformin: Often combined to improve glycemic control in Type 2 diabetes.
- Other long-acting insulins (e.g., glargine, detemir): May be added to basal-bolus regimens if NovoLog Mix 70/30 alone does not achieve target control.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Careful dose titration and monitoring are crucial, especially during illness, changes in activity levels, or diet. Education on hypoglycemia management is essential.
- **Specific Populations:** Monitor closely.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Diet, exercise, and alcohol intake affect blood glucose levels and may necessitate dosage adjustments.
