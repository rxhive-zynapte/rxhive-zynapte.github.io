## **Usage**

- Insulin Degludec + Liraglutide is prescribed as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is typically used when blood sugar levels are not adequately controlled by other medications, including basal insulin or liraglutide alone.  It is not indicated for type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antidiabetic combination; Long-acting insulin and GLP-1 receptor agonist.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination drug works through two distinct mechanisms:
    * **Insulin Degludec:** A long-acting basal insulin analog that lowers blood glucose by facilitating glucose uptake into peripheral tissues (muscle and fat) and inhibiting hepatic glucose production.
    * **Liraglutide:** A glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that increases glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppresses glucagon secretion, slows gastric emptying, and may reduce appetite.


## **Alternate Names**

- **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Insulin degludec/liraglutide
- **Brand Name:** Xultophy


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  The combination of insulin degludec and liraglutide provides complementary effects on glycemic control. Insulin degludec provides a stable basal insulin level, while liraglutide enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppresses glucagon, and slows gastric emptying, reducing postprandial glucose excursions.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    * **Absorption:**  Administered subcutaneously, both components are absorbed into the systemic circulation. Insulin degludec forms soluble multi-hexamers at the injection site, resulting in slow and prolonged absorption, providing a steady basal insulin level for approximately 24 hours. Liraglutide absorption is also delayed due to its self-association property and slow release from the subcutaneous depot.
    * **Metabolism:** Insulin degludec is metabolized primarily at the injection site and in peripheral tissues, similar to human insulin. Liraglutide is metabolized by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) and other proteolytic enzymes, resulting in smaller peptides and amino acids.
    * **Elimination:**  The metabolites of both components are eliminated through renal and hepatic pathways.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Initial Dose (naïve to basal insulin or GLP-1 RA):** 10 units insulin degludec/0.36 mg liraglutide subcutaneously once daily.
- **Initial Dose (currently on basal insulin or GLP-1 RA):** 16 units insulin degludec/0.58 mg liraglutide subcutaneously once daily.
- **Titration:** Adjust dose by 2 units every 3-4 days based on fasting plasma glucose, aiming for target levels. Maximum daily dose is 50 units insulin degludec/1.8 mg liraglutide.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established in this population.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients (≥ 65 years):**  Initiate with conservative dosing and titrate cautiously due to increased risk of hypoglycemia. Enhanced glucose monitoring is recommended. Limited experience in patients ≥ 75 years.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Intensified glucose monitoring and individual dose adjustment are necessary. Not recommended for patients with moderate to severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Limited experience; use with caution. Closely monitor glucose levels.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Individualized dosing and monitoring are essential.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Insulin Degludec + Liraglutide is not specifically indicated for use in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its primary use is for the long-term management of type 2 diabetes. For these acute care settings, short-acting insulins and other appropriate glucose management strategies are typically employed.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection
- Headache
- Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation
- Injection site reactions


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Pancreatitis (acute or chronic): Severe abdominal pain radiating to the back, nausea, vomiting, fever.
- Hypoglycemia: Tremors, sweating, confusion, dizziness, loss of consciousness.
- Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis and angioedema):  Hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat.
- Gallbladder disease: Severe stomach pain, fever, nausea, vomiting.
- Renal impairment: Decreased urine output, swelling in ankles or feet.
- Thyroid C-cell tumors (in rodents; unknown risk in humans).


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to insulin degludec, liraglutide, or any component of the formulation.
- Personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2).
- Episodes of hypoglycemia.


## **Drug Interactions**

- **Medications affecting glucose metabolism:**  May require dose adjustments of Insulin Degludec + Liraglutide.
- **Drugs delaying gastric emptying:** Liraglutide may affect the absorption of oral medications.
- **Examples:**
    - Antidiabetic agents (e.g., sulfonylureas, insulin)
    - Beta-blockers
    - Corticosteroids
    - Thiazide diuretics
    - Alcohol



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Limited human data; potential risk based on animal studies with liraglutide (increased embryofetal death and fetal abnormalities).  Generally, insulin is preferred for managing diabetes during pregnancy. Weigh benefits against risks.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Both components are excreted in animal milk; unknown if excreted in human milk. Exercise caution. Consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother's clinical need and potential adverse effects on the infant.
