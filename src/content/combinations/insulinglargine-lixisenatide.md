## **Usage**

Insulin glargine + lixisenatide is prescribed as an adjunct to diet and exercise for improving glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is a combination medication consisting of a long-acting insulin analog (insulin glargine) and a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (lixisenatide).  Its pharmacological classifications are antidiabetic combination, long-acting insulin, and GLP-1 receptor agonist.

The mechanism of action involves two components: insulin glargine, which lowers blood glucose by facilitating glucose uptake into cells and inhibiting hepatic glucose production, and lixisenatide, which increases glucose-dependent insulin secretion, decreases glucagon secretion, and slows gastric emptying.

## **Alternate Names**

This fixed-dose combination medication is most commonly known as Soliqua 100/33 in the United States and Suliqua in Europe and other regions.  There are two available pre-filled pen options: Suliqua (10-40) and Suliqua (30-60).

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Insulin glargine provides a basal level of insulin, mimicking the body's natural insulin production.  Lixisenatide complements this by increasing insulin release after meals and suppressing glucagon secretion, further aiding glucose control. It also slows gastric emptying.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Insulin glargine is slowly absorbed from the subcutaneous injection site, providing a relatively constant concentration over 24 hours. Lixisenatide is also absorbed subcutaneously and reaches peak concentration within 1 to 2 hours.  Insulin glargine is metabolized to active metabolites M1 and M2, and lixisenatide is primarily eliminated through the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** Insulin glargine binds to insulin receptors, activating downstream pathways that promote glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis. Lixisenatide binds to GLP-1 receptors on pancreatic beta cells, enhancing glucose-dependent insulin release.

**Receptor Binding:** Insulin glargine binds to insulin receptors. Lixisenatide binds to and activates GLP-1 receptors.

**Elimination Pathways:** Insulin glargine undergoes enzymatic degradation, and its metabolites are primarily excreted through the kidneys.  Lixisenatide is predominantly excreted unchanged via the kidneys.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The starting dose depends on previous antidiabetic treatment.  For insulin-naive patients or those on less than 30 units of basal insulin daily, a starting dose of 15 units insulin glargine and 5 mcg lixisenatide (15 dose steps of Soliqua 100/33) subcutaneously once daily is recommended. Patients using 30 to 60 units of basal insulin daily may start with 30 dose steps (30 units/10 mcg) once daily.  Titration is based on individual patient needs, adjusted by 2-4 dose steps weekly based on fasting plasma glucose and glycemic control goals. The maximum daily dose is 60 units/20 mcg (60 dose steps).

#### **Children:**

Use in pediatric patients is not recommended as safety and efficacy have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be needed based on individual glucose monitoring due to age-related changes in renal function and insulin sensitivity.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Mild to moderate impairment requires careful monitoring. Severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease: Use is not recommended due to the potential accumulation of lixisenatide.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No dose adjustment is needed for lixisenatide. Frequent glucose monitoring and dose adjustment of insulin glargine may be required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider individual patient needs and adjust the dose accordingly.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Insulin glargine + lixisenatide is intended for chronic management of type 2 diabetes. Its use in acute settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations is not indicated.  In such situations, other insulin formulations are preferred due to their faster onset and shorter duration of action.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage should be individualized and titrated based on fasting plasma glucose, glycemic control goals, and patient response. Close glucose monitoring is recommended during dose adjustments and when other factors are present, such as changes in physical activity, meal patterns, or renal/hepatic function, or when initiating or discontinuing other medications.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, hypoglycemia, and injection site reactions.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Pancreatitis (acute or hemorrhagic), severe hypoglycemia, anaphylaxis, angioedema, and severe hypersensitivity reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential long-term effects might include weight changes, hypokalemia, and altered lipid profiles.  Regular monitoring for these is important.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs include anaphylaxis, angioedema, pancreatitis, and severe hypoglycemia. These require prompt discontinuation of the drug and immediate medical attention.



## **Contraindications**

Absolute contraindications include hypersensitivity to the active substances or any of the excipients, and during episodes of hypoglycemia.  It should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis, or a history of pancreatitis. Relative contraindications include severe renal impairment and end-stage renal disease.


## **Drug Interactions**

Clinically significant interactions can occur with drugs that affect glucose metabolism or gastric emptying.  Examples include sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, other GLP-1 receptor agonists, and certain oral contraceptives. Close monitoring is recommended when initiating or discontinuing these medications.  Alcohol can also potentiate the hypoglycemic effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy: Not recommended for women of childbearing potential not using contraception. There are limited data in pregnant women. Animal studies with lixisenatide have shown reproductive toxicity.

Breastfeeding: It is unknown whether the components are excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment.
