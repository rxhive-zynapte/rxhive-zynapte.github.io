## **Usage**

- Insulin Lispro + Insulin Lispro Protamine is prescribed for the treatment of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults and children. This premixed insulin formulation helps manage blood glucose levels by providing both rapid and intermediate-acting insulin in a single injection.
- **Pharmacological classification:**  Rapid-acting and intermediate-acting insulin combination; Antidiabetic agent.
- **Mechanism of action:** This combination provides a biphasic insulin action. The insulin lispro component starts working quickly to cover postprandial glucose elevations, while the insulin lispro protamine offers a prolonged effect to address basal insulin requirements. Both components work by binding to insulin receptors, facilitating glucose uptake into cells and suppressing hepatic glucose production.

## **Alternate Names**

- Insulin lispro protamine/insulin lispro mix.
- **Brand names:** Humalog Mix75/25 (75% insulin lispro protamine and 25% insulin lispro), Humalog Mix50/50 (50% insulin lispro protamine and 50% insulin lispro).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Both insulin lispro and insulin lispro protamine mimic the action of endogenous insulin by binding to insulin receptors on cell surfaces. This promotes glucose uptake into skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, inhibits hepatic glucose output, and influences protein and lipid metabolism.  The combination delivers a faster onset of action and a longer duration compared to regular human insulin.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Insulin lispro is rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous injection, with a peak concentration reached within 30 minutes to 2 hours.  Insulin lispro protamine's absorption is slower and more prolonged, leading to a longer duration of action. Both are metabolized primarily in the liver and kidneys and eliminated through renal and hepatic pathways.
- **Mode of Action:** Receptor binding to insulin receptors.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily hepatic and renal.

## **Dosage**

Dosage must be individualized based on the patient's metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring results, and glycemic goals. The information provided below should be used as general guidelines, and it is crucial for healthcare professionals to consider patient-specific factors when determining the appropriate dosage.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The initial dosage varies greatly depending on individual patient needs and may range from 0.5 to 1 unit/kg/day, divided into multiple doses. Non-obese individuals might need lower doses (0.4-0.6 unit/kg/day), while obese individuals might require higher doses (0.8-1.2 unit/kg/day).
- Usually injected subcutaneously within 15 minutes before a meal.
- Typically administered twice daily to cover two meals, or a meal and a snack, with each injection.

#### **Children:**

- Dosing in children should also be individualized based on their specific requirements (0.4â€“1 units/kg/day) and adjusted based on growth, puberty, and blood glucose monitoring. Safety and efficacy haven't been established in children younger than 3 years old.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and adjust cautiously due to potential age-related changes in renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments are necessary. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential to prevent adverse effects.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Adjust dosage carefully and monitor closely.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments may be required depending on the specific comorbidity, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease or other metabolic disorders.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosage in these scenarios should be adjusted based on blood glucose monitoring and the patient's clinical status.
- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, Emergency Situations:** Insulin infusion may be necessary, with regular blood glucose monitoring to titrate the dosage and maintain optimal glycemic control.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on patient-specific factors, including renal/hepatic function, metabolic disorders, and concomitant medications. Frequent blood glucose monitoring is vital for dosage titration and preventing adverse effects.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).
- Injection site reactions (redness, swelling, itching).
- Weight gain.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Severe hypoglycemia (loss of consciousness, seizures).

- Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Anaphylaxis requires immediate medical attention.
