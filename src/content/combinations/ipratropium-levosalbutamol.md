## **Usage**

- Ipratropium + Levosalbutamol is prescribed for the treatment and prevention of bronchospasm associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  It helps relieve symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing, and wheezing.  It may also be used in acute severe asthma attacks.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Bronchodilator (combining an anticholinergic and a beta-2 adrenergic agonist).
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination medication works by widening the airways in the lungs. Ipratropium, an anticholinergic, blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that causes airway constriction and mucus secretion. Levosalbutamol, a beta-2 adrenergic agonist, stimulates beta-2 receptors in the lungs, leading to relaxation of the airway smooth muscles.

## **Alternate Names**

- The combination may sometimes be referred to as Ipratropium Bromide + Levosalbutamol Sulfate.
- **Brand Names:**  Combivent, Combivent Respimat, Duolin, DuoNeb.  (Note: Brand names can vary by region.)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ipratropium reduces cholinergic-mediated bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion. Levosalbutamol relaxes the bronchial smooth muscle, leading to bronchodilation and increased airflow.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  
    - *Absorption:* Ipratropium is minimally absorbed systemically after inhalation, with most of the dose remaining in the lungs. Levosalbutamol is absorbed systemically after inhalation, but its effects are primarily localized to the lungs.
    - *Metabolism:*  Levosalbutamol is preferentially metabolized by the liver compared to its enantiomer and is cleared more rapidly. It is primarily metabolized to an inactive sulfate conjugate. Ipratropium undergoes some metabolism in the liver.
    - *Elimination:* Both drugs are primarily eliminated via renal excretion. 
- **Mode of Action:**  Ipratropium acts by competitively blocking muscarinic cholinergic receptors (M3) in the bronchial smooth muscle, thereby inhibiting bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion. Levosalbutamol selectively stimulates beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the lungs, activating intracellular signaling pathways that lead to smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Ipratropium blocks the binding of acetylcholine to muscarinic receptors. Levosalbutamol binds to beta-2 adrenergic receptors.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion, with some hepatic metabolism for both drugs.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Nebulizer:** One unit dose vial (containing Ipratropium Bromide 0.5 mg and Levosalbutamol Sulfate 1.25mg) three to four times daily, every 6-8 hours via nebulization.

#### **Children:**

- **Nebulizer:** For children 2 to 12 years: 3 drops/kg/dose (maximum dose 2500 mcg of Levosalbutamol) every 6 to 8 hours via nebulization.  Use with caution.  Safety and efficacy not fully established in this age group.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** The standard adult dosage is generally applicable. Monitor closely for adverse effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution and monitor kidney function. Dose adjustment might be needed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution and monitor liver function. Dose adjustment might be needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, glaucoma, prostatic hyperplasia, and bladder neck obstruction. Monitor closely.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use/Emergency Situations:** Dosage should be individualized according to patient's response and clinical status. Nebulization is the preferred route in these settings. Initiate treatment under medical supervision, especially for higher doses or unstable patients.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- Dosage should be individualized based on patient response and clinical status.  Patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction may require dosage adjustments.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Dry mouth, cough, headache, nausea, dizziness, nervousness, tremor, palpitations, tachycardia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Paradoxical bronchospasm, angioedema, urticaria, hypersensitivity reactions, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, cardiac arrhythmias.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

-  Worsening of pre-existing cardiovascular conditions, development of tolerance with prolonged use (potential need for dose adjustments or addition of other medications), hypokalemia with chronic high doses.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

-  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), significant hypokalemia, severe paradoxical bronchospasm, acute angle-closure glaucoma.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to ipratropium, levosalbutamol, atropine or its derivatives.
- Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy or tachyarrhythmia.


## **Drug Interactions**

- **Beta-blockers:** Can antagonize the bronchodilatory effects of levosalbutamol and exacerbate bronchospasm.
- **Other Anticholinergics:**  Can increase the risk of anticholinergic side effects.
- **Diuretics:** Can increase the risk of hypokalemia.
- **MAO Inhibitors and Tricyclic Antidepressants:** Can potentiate the effects of levosalbutamol, increasing the risk of cardiovascular side effects.
- **Halogenated Hydrocarbon Anesthetics:** May enhance the cardiovascular effects of beta-2 agonists.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (US FDA).  Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus.
- **Fetal Risks:** Potential for adverse effects, especially at higher doses. Monitor carefully.  Avoid use close to term due to the potential for uterine relaxation.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Not known if excreted in breast milk. Use cautiously.

## **Drug Profile Summary**
