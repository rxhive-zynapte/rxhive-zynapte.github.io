## **Usage**

Ipratropium + Xylometazoline nasal spray is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of nasal congestion (blocked nose) and rhinorrhea (runny nose) associated with the common cold in adults.

It is classified as a decongestant and anticholinergic combination.

The drug combines two active ingredients: xylometazoline, a decongestant that constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages to reduce swelling, and ipratropium, an anticholinergic that reduces nasal secretions.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication may also be referred to as ipratropium bromide/xylometazoline hydrochloride. Brand names include Otrivine Extra Dual Relief, Otrivine Plus, Otrivine Comp,  and ZyComb, among others. Regional variations in names might exist.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Xylometazoline, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors in the nasal mucosa, causing vasoconstriction. This reduces blood flow to the nasal tissues, alleviating congestion. Ipratropium bromide, an anticholinergic agent, blocks the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, reducing nasal secretions and the sneezing reflex.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Both drugs are minimally absorbed systemically following intranasal administration. Consequently, plasma concentrations are low.
* **Metabolism:** Limited information available about the metabolism of the combined formulation. Studies are available for individual compounds.
* **Elimination:** Limited information available about the elimination of the combined formulation. Studies are available for individual compounds.


**Mode of Action:** Xylometazoline exerts its decongestant effect through alpha-adrenergic receptor binding and subsequent vasoconstriction. Ipratropium's anticholinergic action is exerted by competitively binding to and inhibiting muscarinic receptors on seromucous glands in the nasal mucosa.

**Elimination pathways:** Although limited information is available for the combined product, some data are available for individual components. For example, ipratropium is primarily eliminated via the renal route with a half-life of several hours. Xylometazoline likely gets metabolized by CYP enzymes with faster elimination half-life, resulting in the potential for accumulation of both components with regular use.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One spray in each nostril up to 3 times daily. Maintain at least a 6-hour interval between doses. Do not exceed 3 applications per nostril in a 24-hour period.  The treatment duration should not exceed 7 days.

#### **Children:**

This medication is contraindicated in children and adolescents under 18 years of age due to insufficient safety and efficacy data.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Limited experience exists in patients over 70. Caution is advised, and using the lowest effective dose is recommended.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustments may be needed. Consult specialized resources for detailed recommendations.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments may be needed. Consult specialized resources for detailed recommendations.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with hypertension, cardiovascular diseases (especially long QT syndrome), hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, prostatic hypertrophy, bladder neck obstruction, pheochromocytoma, narrow-angle glaucoma, and cystic fibrosis. Patients on monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants, or beta-2 agonists should also exercise caution.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of Ipratropium + Xylometazoline is specifically indicated for the relief of nasal congestion and rhinorrhea due to the common cold. It is not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are required for specific populations as mentioned above. Consult specialized drug resources for detailed guidance on dosage modifications based on renal/hepatic function, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Epistaxis (nosebleed), nasal dryness, nasal discomfort, headache, nausea, dizziness, dysgeusia (altered taste), throat irritation, dry throat, dry mouth.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Hypersensitivity reactions (including angioedema, rash, pruritus), tachycardia, palpitations, insomnia, tremor, eye irritation, vision changes (blurred vision, seeing halos), difficulty urinating, mental/mood changes.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Rhinitis medicamentosa (rebound congestion) can occur with prolonged use (greater than 7 days).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Any sign of hypersensitivity reaction requires immediate medical attention.  Other ADRs that necessitate intervention include severe cardiovascular effects (e.g., significant tachycardia, palpitations), eye problems, or difficulty urinating.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to either active ingredient or any excipients.  Hypersensitivity to atropine or atropine-like substances (e.g., hyoscyamine, scopolamine). History of trans-sphenoidal hypophysectomy or other trans-nasal surgeries. Glaucoma. Rhinitis sicca or atrophic rhinitis.  Children under 18.

## **Drug Interactions**

MAOIs or recent use (within 14 days) can lead to potentially dangerous interactions. Tricyclic antidepressants and beta-2 agonists should be used with caution. Concomitant use of other anticholinergic drugs may potentiate anticholinergic side effects. While formal studies on drug interactions with the combination product are limited, interactions have been studied for each individual component. For example, concomitant use of ipratropium with beta-2 agonists can increase the risk of acute glaucoma in susceptible individuals.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy:**  Use only if clearly needed and under strict medical supervision. Insufficient data are available regarding the safety of the combination product during pregnancy. Both Xylometazoline and Ipratropium showed some risk in animal studies or preclinical settings.

**Breastfeeding:** Insufficient data are available on whether ipratropium or xylometazoline are excreted in breast milk. It's advisable to discuss the risks and benefits with a physician before using the product while breastfeeding. Systemic absorption is low so infant exposure is anticipated to be minimal, but if the mother's expected benefit outweighs any potential risk to the infant, the lowest effective dose and shortest duration is suggested.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Xylometazoline: alpha-adrenergic agonist causing vasoconstriction. Ipratropium: anticholinergic, inhibits nasal secretions.
* **Side Effects:** Epistaxis, nasal dryness, headache, nausea, dizziness. Rarely: hypersensitivity reactions, cardiovascular effects, eye problems, urinary retention.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, trans-nasal/sphenoidal surgeries, glaucoma, rhinitis sicca/atrophic rhinitis, children <18.
* **Drug Interactions:** MAOIs, tricyclic antidepressants, beta-2 agonists, other anticholinergics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Consult with a physician before use. Use with caution.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 1 spray/nostril, up to 3 times/day, max 7 days.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, heart rate, ocular pressure (if at risk for glaucoma), nasal mucosa for irritation.

## **Popular Combinations**

Ipratropium + Xylometazoline itself represents a popular combination for addressing both nasal congestion and rhinorrhea.  It is not generally combined with other medications for intranasal use. Systemic treatments for cold symptoms, such as analgesics or antipyretics, might be used concurrently as needed.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Screen for allergies, relevant comorbidities (see "Special Cases" under Dosage), and concomitant medications.
* **Specific Populations:** See "Special Cases" under Dosage. 
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Advise patients about potential dizziness and avoid operating heavy machinery or driving if affected. Avoid alcohol as it might worsen some side effects.
