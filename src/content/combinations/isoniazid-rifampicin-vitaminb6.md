## **Usage**

This combination drug is primarily prescribed for the treatment of active tuberculosis (TB). It is also used for the prevention of TB in individuals who have been exposed to the bacteria or are at high risk of developing the disease (latent TB infection).

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Antimycobacterial, Antituberculosis

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination targets *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* through multiple pathways. Isoniazid inhibits mycolic acid synthesis, a crucial component of the bacterial cell wall. Rifampicin inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase, thus suppressing gene transcription. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is included to mitigate the peripheral neuropathy, a common side effect of isoniazid.

## **Alternate Names**

This specific combination doesn't have a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN). It's often referred to as "isoniazid/rifampicin/pyridoxine" or "INH/RIF/B6".  Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region. 

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Isoniazid is bactericidal against actively growing *M. tuberculosis*. Rifampicin is bactericidal against both intracellular and extracellular *M. tuberculosis*.  Vitamin B6 doesn't have a direct effect on the bacteria but protects against isoniazid-induced neuropathy by aiding in the synthesis of neurotransmitters.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Isoniazid:** Well-absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver by acetylation.  Eliminated primarily through renal excretion.
* **Rifampicin:**  Well-absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver. Eliminated through biliary and renal pathways. Induces CYP450 enzymes, impacting the metabolism of other drugs.
* **Vitamin B6:** Readily absorbed from the GI tract.  Excreted in urine.

**Mode of Action:** Isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids, essential components of the mycobacterial cell wall. Rifampicin binds to the bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, blocking RNA synthesis.

**Elimination Pathways:**

* **Isoniazid:** Renal excretion (as metabolites).
* **Rifampicin:** Hepatic and biliary excretion, some renal excretion.
* **Vitamin B6:** Renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

For active TB: 
* Isoniazid: 5 mg/kg (up to 300 mg) orally once daily *or* 15 mg/kg (up to 900 mg) two or three times weekly.
* Rifampicin: 10 mg/kg (up to 600 mg) orally once daily *or* 10mg/kg twice weekly DOT (not to exceed 600mg/day).
* Vitamin B6: 10-25 mg orally once daily.

For latent TB infection: 
* Isoniazid: 300 mg orally once daily.
* Rifampicin: 600 mg orally once daily (in combination regimens for 3-4 months)
* Vitamin B6: 10-25 mg orally once daily.

#### **Children:**

Dosing for children should be determined by a pediatrician and is typically weight-based. 

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Close monitoring is required.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary. 
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized dosing considerations depending on the specific comorbidity.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing for TB remains consistent across clinical settings. Specific regimens are determined by the type of TB (pulmonary, extrapulmonary, drug-resistant) and patient-specific factors.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments should be made in cases of renal or hepatic impairment, and in patients with slow acetylator status (genetic polymorphism affecting isoniazid metabolism).  Therapeutic drug monitoring may be beneficial in some cases.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

* Nausea, vomiting
* Loss of appetite
* Abdominal discomfort
* Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling in hands and feet)
* Orange discoloration of body fluids (urine, sweat, tears) with rifampicin


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Drug-induced hepatitis
* Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
* Thrombocytopenia
* Acute renal failure


### **Long-Term Effects**

Peripheral neuropathy can be a long-term effect of isoniazid if not managed appropriately. Hepatotoxicity may have long-term implications.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Any signs of hepatitis (jaundice, dark urine, abdominal pain) or severe skin reactions warrant immediate discontinuation of the medication and medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any component of the drug.
* Acute liver disease.
* Porphyria.
* Chronic alcoholism.


## **Drug Interactions**

Rifampicin is a potent inducer of CYP450 enzymes and can significantly decrease the effectiveness of many drugs, including:

* Antiretrovirals (e.g., protease inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors)
* Oral contraceptives
* Warfarin
* Anticonvulsants
* Antifungals


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

This drug combination can be used during pregnancy but requires careful monitoring.  It is excreted in breast milk. The benefits of treatment for the mother often outweigh the risks to the fetus/infant, particularly in cases of active TB. Pyridoxine requirements are often increased in pregnancy.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Isoniazid inhibits mycolic acid synthesis, rifampicin inhibits RNA polymerase.  Vitamin B6 prevents neuropathy.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, hepatitis, peripheral neuropathy, orange discoloration of body fluids (rifampicin).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, acute liver disease, porphyria.
* **Drug Interactions:** Numerous, due to rifampicin's effect on CYP450 enzymes.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Can be used with caution and monitoring.
* **Dosage:** See detailed section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests, signs of hepatitis, neurological examination for neuropathy.


## **Popular Combinations**

The combination of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol is a standard first-line treatment for active TB.



## **Precautions**

* Baseline liver function tests should be conducted and monitored regularly.
* Patients should be advised to report any signs or symptoms of hepatitis.
* Patients should be screened for risk factors of peripheral neuropathy (diabetes, alcoholism).
* Patients taking rifampicin should be educated about the potential for drug interactions and orange discoloration of body fluids.
