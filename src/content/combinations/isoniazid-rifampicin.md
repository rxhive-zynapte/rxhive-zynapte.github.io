## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Isoniazid + Rifampicin is primarily prescribed for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB), both active and latent. It is a crucial component of multi-drug regimens used to combat this bacterial infection.  The combination is particularly important for preventing the development of drug-resistant TB.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antimycobacterial, Antitubercular, Antibiotic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids, essential components of the mycobacterial cell wall. Rifampicin inhibits bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, preventing RNA synthesis and subsequent protein synthesis in susceptible bacteria. The combination exhibits synergistic activity against *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:**  No widely recognized international variations exist for the combination. Individual components are sometimes referred to as isonicotinylhydrazide (INH) for isoniazid and rifampin for rifampicin.
- **Brand Names:** Rifamate, IsonaRif, Rifinah (for combined tablets).  Numerous generic formulations are also available.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Isoniazid acts primarily on actively growing mycobacteria by disrupting cell wall formation. Rifampicin also targets actively replicating bacteria by suppressing RNA synthesis.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Both drugs are well-absorbed orally, ideally administered on an empty stomach. Food can reduce rifampicin absorption.
    - **Metabolism:**  Isoniazid is metabolized primarily by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) in the liver, with genetic polymorphisms influencing the rate of acetylation (fast vs. slow acetylators). Rifampicin is metabolized in the liver and undergoes enterohepatic circulation. It is a potent inducer of several cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP450).
    - **Elimination:**  Isoniazid metabolites are excreted renally. Rifampicin is eliminated primarily in bile and feces, with a smaller portion excreted in urine.
- **Mode of Action:** Isoniazid inhibits the InhA enzyme, responsible for mycolic acid synthesis, crucial for mycobacterial cell wall integrity. Rifampicin binds to the Î²-subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase, blocking transcription initiation.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Isoniazid inhibits InhA. Rifampicin inhibits bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Isoniazid can also inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO).
- **Elimination Pathways:** Isoniazid - primarily renal excretion of metabolites.  Rifampicin - primarily biliary/fecal excretion, some renal excretion.  Rifampicin induces CYP450 enzymes (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4), significantly impacting the metabolism of other drugs.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 300 mg Isoniazid + 600 mg Rifampicin once daily, on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals). Two capsules of Rifamate or IsonaRif are typically prescribed.
- Maximum Dose:  Isoniazid:  300 mg/day. Rifampicin: 600 mg/day (in combination).

#### **Children:**

- Dosage is weight-based:
    - Isoniazid: 10-20 mg/kg daily (max 300 mg/day).
    - Rifampicin: 10-20 mg/kg daily (max 600 mg/day).
- Pediatric dispersible formulations are available to ensure accurate dosing.
- Monitor closely for adverse effects.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Monitor liver function closely.  May require dose adjustments based on renal/hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Closely monitor renal function and for signs of isoniazid toxicity. Dose reduction may be necessary in severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Monitor closely for hepatotoxicity. Dose adjustments, or discontinuation, may be needed. Contraindicated in active liver disease.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised in patients with diabetes, HIV infection, or other conditions affecting drug metabolism.  Vitamin B6 supplementation is often recommended for patients at risk of peripheral neuropathy (e.g., diabetes, malnutrition, HIV).


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources primarily focus on the use of Isoniazid + Rifampicin for tuberculosis treatment and prophylaxis.  Dosing in the context of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations is not specifically addressed.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- **Renal/Hepatic Dysfunction:** Adjust doses based on the severity of impairment, as detailed in the "Special Cases" section.
- **Metabolic Disorders/Genetic Polymorphisms:**  Slow acetylators may require dose adjustments for isoniazid to avoid toxicity.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Red-orange discoloration of body fluids (urine, tears, sweat, saliva).
- Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling).
- Nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort.
- Loss of appetite.
- Headache, dizziness.
- Mild rash.
- Flu-like symptoms.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Hepatotoxicity (jaundice, liver failure).
- Drug-induced hepatitis.
- Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis).
- Thrombocytopenia.
- Acute renal failure.
- Seizures.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Peripheral neuropathy (if not managed).
- Liver damage (with chronic, unmanaged hepatotoxicity).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to isoniazid or rifampicin.
- Active liver disease (acute hepatitis, cirrhosis).
- Previous isoniazid-induced liver injury.
- Concurrent use with saquinavir/ritonavir.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Rifampicin is a potent inducer of CYP450 enzymes, leading to decreased efficacy of numerous drugs, including:
    - Oral contraceptives.
    - Warfarin.
    - Some antiretrovirals.
    - Corticosteroids.
    - Anticonvulsants.
- Isoniazid can inhibit the metabolism of certain drugs, such as phenytoin.
- Antacids can reduce rifampicin absorption.
- Alcohol increases the risk of hepatotoxicity.
- Tyramine-containing foods (cheese, red wine) and histamine-rich foods (tuna, skipjack) may interact with isoniazid due to its MAO-inhibiting activity.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (consult a specialist).
- **Fetal Risks/Teratogenicity:** Potential risks, although generally considered safe when benefits outweigh risks.  Adequate folate supplementation is recommended.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Generally considered compatible with breastfeeding. Monitor infants for jaundice.  Mothers taking isoniazid should receive pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation.
