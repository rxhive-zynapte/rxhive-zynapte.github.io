## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Isoniazid + Sodium aminosalicylate is prescribed for the treatment of active tuberculosis (TB) infections caused by susceptible strains of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.  Sodium aminosalicylate is specifically used as part of a combination regimen for drug-resistant tuberculosis, especially when resistance to other first-line drugs like isoniazid and rifampicin is present. It is also used to treat latent TB infection.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antituberculosis agents (Sodium aminosalicylate is a bacteriostatic agent, while Isoniazid is bactericidal).
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Sodium aminosalicylate inhibits folic acid synthesis in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* by competing with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). Isoniazid inhibits mycolic acid synthesis, a crucial component of the mycobacterial cell wall. These combined actions disrupt essential metabolic processes in the bacteria, leading to their death or growth inhibition.

## **Alternate Names**

- **Sodium aminosalicylate:**  Para-aminosalicylate sodium (PAS), 4-aminosalicylic acid (sodium salt).
- **Brand Names:**  Paser, other brand names may exist regionally.
- **Isoniazid in Combination with PAS:** Pasinah, Pycamisan 33 (historical).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Isoniazid is bactericidal against actively growing *M. tuberculosis* by inhibiting mycolic acid synthesis, a key component of the mycobacterial cell wall. Sodium aminosalicylate is bacteriostatic, inhibiting folic acid synthesis.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Sodium aminosalicylate:** Well-absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver, primarily excreted in urine. Short half-life (about 1 hour).
    - **Isoniazid:**  Well-absorbed orally or intramuscularly. Metabolized in the liver by acetylation, with genetic variations in acetylation rate affecting individual pharmacokinetics. Primarily excreted in the urine.
- **Mode of Action:** The combination targets two different metabolic pathways in *M. tuberculosis*. Sodium aminosalicylate competes with PABA for dihydropteroate synthase, inhibiting folate synthesis, which is crucial for bacterial DNA synthesis. Isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids, essential components of the mycobacterial cell wall.
- **Elimination Pathways:**
    - **Sodium aminosalicylate:** Renal excretion.
    - **Isoniazid:** Hepatic metabolism (acetylation) and renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Sodium aminosalicylate: 12-15g daily divided into 2-3 doses.
Isoniazid: 5mg/kg, up to a maximum of 300mg daily.


#### **Children:**

Sodium aminosalicylate: 150 mg/kg daily divided into 3-4 doses. Pediatric dosages should be carefully determined by the physician based on weight and other clinical factors.
Isoniazid: 10-20 mg/kg daily, up to a maximum of 300mg.



#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary for both drugs, particularly in the presence of renal or hepatic impairment. Consider lower starting doses and monitor closely for adverse events.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Reduce dosage based on creatinine clearance for both drugs. Monitor closely for toxicity.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use both drugs with caution.  Monitor liver function tests regularly.  Dosage adjustments may be required.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider drug interactions and potential exacerbation of existing conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Isoniazid + sodium aminosalicylate is not typically used in acute medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its use is primarily in the treatment of active or latent tuberculosis infections.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are necessary based on patient-specific factors, including renal function, hepatic function, slow acetylator status (for isoniazid), and other comorbid conditions. Therapeutic drug monitoring may be helpful in optimizing dosage.
