## **Usage**

Isopropamide + Trifluoperazine is indicated for the management of gastrointestinal disorders, primarily:

*   Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)
*   Peptic Ulcers
*   Indigestion/Dyspepsia
*   Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) (off-label)
*   Medicine-induced diarrhea
*   Genitourinary spasms

**Pharmacological Classification:**

*   Isopropamide: Anticholinergic/antispasmodic
*   Trifluoperazine: Antipsychotic/antiemetic

**Mechanism of Action:**

Isopropamide, an anticholinergic agent, blocks acetylcholine's action, relaxing gastrointestinal smooth muscle, reducing spasms and pain.  Trifluoperazine, a phenothiazine antipsychotic, acts as a dopamine antagonist, reducing anxiety and nausea by acting on the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ). At the doses used in this combination, it primarily exerts an antiemetic effect rather than a significant antipsychotic action.

## **Alternate Names**

*   Stelbid
*   Gastabid
*   Spascol
*   Telabid



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

Isopropamide reduces gastrointestinal motility and secretions. Trifluoperazine exerts antiemetic effects by blocking dopamine receptors in the CTZ.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

The pharmacokinetics of the combination product have not been specifically studied.  However, both drugs are absorbed orally. Isopropamide is primarily metabolized in the liver, while trifluoperazine undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism via CYP enzymes.  Both drugs are eliminated through renal and hepatic routes.


**Mode of Action:**

Isopropamide competitively inhibits the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, leading to smooth muscle relaxation in the GI tract. Trifluoperazine blocks dopamine D2 receptors in the CTZ, inhibiting nausea and vomiting.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**

Isopropamide binds to muscarinic receptors. Trifluoperazine blocks dopamine D2 receptors. Specific CYP enzyme interactions for trifluoperazine metabolism have not been comprehensively characterized in this combination product.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One tablet (containing 1mg Trifluoperazine and 5mg Isopropamide) twice daily, every 12 hours.


#### **Children:**

Not recommended for children under 6 years of age.

*   6-12 years: 1mg Trifluoperazine once or twice daily (max 15mg/day). Isopropamide dosing in this age range is not well-established and should be determined by a physician based on individual patient factors.
*   Over 12 years: Adult dose may be used.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Initiate at the lower end of the dose range and titrate cautiously due to increased sensitivity to anticholinergic effects.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised; dose adjustments may be necessary based on clinical response.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution; dose adjustments may be necessary based on the degree of impairment.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, and urinary retention.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is not typically used in the clinical settings described (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations).

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be required for renal/hepatic dysfunction, or in elderly patients.  Dosage adjustments based on metabolic disorders or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism are not specifically defined for this combination product.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

*   Nausea
*   Dry mouth
*   Constipation
*   Drowsiness
*   Dizziness
*   Blurred vision
*   Urinary retention


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

*   Hypotension
*   Extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g., dystonia, tardive dyskinesia)
*   Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)


### **Long-Term Effects**

Tardive dyskinesia can be a long-term side effect of trifluoperazine.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

NMS is a rare but serious ADR requiring immediate intervention.



## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to Isopropamide, Trifluoperazine, or phenothiazines
*   Angle-closure glaucoma
*   Pyloric stenosis
*   Prostatic hypertrophy
*   Severe respiratory depression
*   Blood dyscrasias or bone marrow depression
*   Parkinson's disease
*   Coma or CNS depression
*   Intestinal obstruction

## **Drug Interactions**

*   Anticholinergic drugs (additive effects)
*   CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, opioids, sedatives) - increased CNS depression
*   Antihypertensives – enhanced hypotensive effect
*   Levodopa and dopamine agonists - reduced efficacy
*   Lithium - increased risk of constipation and other anticholinergic side effects
*   Antacids – possible reduced absorption of Isopropamide + Trifluoperazine
*   Quinidine, Codeine, Cetirizine, Insulin Aspart – potential for interactions, though clinical significance needs individual assessment


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

*   **Pregnancy:** Not recommended due to potential fetal risks (Pregnancy Category C).
*   **Breastfeeding:** Not recommended as it can pass into breast milk and potentially harm the infant.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** Isopropamide: Anticholinergic; Trifluoperazine: Dopamine antagonist
*   **Side Effects:** Nausea, dry mouth, constipation, drowsiness, dizziness, blurred vision, urinary retention. Serious: hypotension, extrapyramidal symptoms, NMS.
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, glaucoma, pyloric stenosis, prostatic hypertrophy, bowel obstruction

## **Popular Combinations**

No established "popular combinations" exist for fixed-dose Isopropamide + Trifluoperazine. Other medications may be prescribed concurrently to address specific symptoms or comorbid conditions.

## **Precautions**

*   **General Precautions:** Pre-existing medical conditions (especially cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, and glaucoma) should be assessed before prescribing.
*   **Specific Populations:**  Pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers and children require specific precautions as above.
*   **Lifestyle Considerations:** Alcohol should be avoided.  Caution advised while driving or operating machinery due to potential drowsiness and dizziness.
