## **Usage**

Isosorbide Mononitrate + Metoprolol Succinate is prescribed for the long-term management of angina pectoris (chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart) and hypertension (high blood pressure), particularly in patients with coronary artery disease. This combination is also used to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes in these patients.  It belongs to the pharmacological classifications of nitrates (Isosorbide Mononitrate) and beta-blockers (Metoprolol Succinate).


The mechanism of action involves two components: Isosorbide Mononitrate is a vasodilator, meaning it widens blood vessels. It's converted to nitric oxide in the body, which relaxes vascular smooth muscle, increasing blood flow and oxygen delivery to the heart while reducing its workload. Metoprolol Succinate slows down heart rate and reduces the force of heart contractions by blocking beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, thereby lowering blood pressure and decreasing the heart's oxygen demand.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Isosorbide Mononitrate + Metoprolol Succinate" is the generic name, it is marketed under various brand names such as Met XL NT.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Isosorbide Mononitrate primarily affects the vascular system, causing vasodilation. Metoprolol Succinate primarily affects the heart, reducing heart rate and contractility.  The combined effect leads to improved myocardial oxygen supply and reduced oxygen demand.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Isosorbide Mononitrate:** It's readily absorbed orally and undergoes hepatic metabolism. It's eliminated primarily through renal excretion.
* **Metoprolol Succinate:** It's well-absorbed orally but has significant first-pass metabolism.  Metoprolol succinate is formulated as an extended-release medication, offering a slower, sustained absorption profile.  It's metabolized by CYP2D6 enzymes in the liver and excreted mainly via the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** Isosorbide Mononitrate stimulates guanylate cyclase, increasing cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels, leading to vascular smooth muscle relaxation. Metoprolol Succinate selectively blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, reducing sympathetic stimulation of the heart, which leads to decreased heart rate and contractility.

**Elimination Pathways:** Both drugs are primarily eliminated through renal excretion following hepatic metabolism.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The typical starting dose is 25 mg Metoprolol Succinate/ 5 mg Isosorbide Mononitrate once daily. The dose may be increased as needed based on patient response and tolerance.

#### **Children:**

This combination is generally not recommended for children.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Start with a lower dose and titrate cautiously due to potential age-related decrease in renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment may be required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is required in patients with diabetes, asthma, or peripheral vascular disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of Isosorbide Mononitrate and Metoprolol Succinate is typically not used in acute clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary role is in chronic management of stable angina and hypertension. For acute situations, other medications like intravenous nitroglycerin or other beta-blockers are preferred.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments should be based on individual patient response, renal function, and hepatic function.  Genetic polymorphisms affecting CYP2D6 activity may also influence Metoprolol metabolism and necessitate dose adjustments.


## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects:**

Headache, dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, nausea, slow heart rate (bradycardia), hypotension (low blood pressure).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe hypotension, bradycardia, worsening heart failure, bronchospasm (in patients with asthma), peripheral vasoconstriction (Raynaud's phenomenon).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Tolerance to the nitrate component can develop with prolonged use. Regular monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is crucial during long-term therapy.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe hypotension, bradycardia requiring intervention, angioedema (rare but serious).


## **Contraindications**

* Severe bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome, second or third-degree atrioventricular block (unless a pacemaker is present), cardiogenic shock, severe hypotension, decompensated heart failure, hypersensitivity to nitrates or beta-blockers.


## **Drug Interactions**

* Other antihypertensives (additive hypotensive effects).
* Calcium channel blockers (increased risk of hypotension and bradycardia).
* Antidepressants (especially tricyclic antidepressants - can enhance hypotensive effects).
* Diuretics (additive hypotensive effects).
* Cardiac glycosides (digoxin - can worsen bradycardia).
* Alcohol (enhances hypotensive effects).
*  CYP2D6 inhibitors (may increase Metoprolol levels).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. Metoprolol is generally considered safe during pregnancy, while data on Isosorbide Mononitrate use during pregnancy are limited.
* **Breastfeeding:** Metoprolol is excreted in breast milk. Isosorbide Mononitrate excretion in breast milk is unknown. Use with caution during breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Nitrate-induced vasodilation and beta-blocker-mediated reduction in heart rate and contractility.
* **Side Effects:** Headache, dizziness, hypotension, bradycardia.
* **Contraindications:** Severe hypotension, bradycardia, heart block, decompensated heart failure.
* **Drug Interactions:** Other antihypertensives, calcium channel blockers, antidepressants.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution.
* **Dosage:** Start with 25 mg Metoprolol Succinate/5 mg Isosorbide Mononitrate once daily. Adjust based on patient response.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, heart rate, signs of heart failure.

## **Popular Combinations**

This fixed-dose combination is itself a popular combination.  Adding other antihypertensives or antianginal agents may be considered based on individual patient needs, but careful monitoring for adverse effects is essential.

## **Precautions**

* Assess for pre-existing heart conditions, renal/hepatic impairment, asthma, or peripheral vascular disease.
* Monitor blood pressure and heart rate regularly.
* Caution patients about potential dizziness and advise against driving or operating machinery if affected.
* Advise patients not to discontinue medication abruptly.
