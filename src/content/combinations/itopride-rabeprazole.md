## **Usage**

Itopride + Rabeprazole is prescribed for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcers, and functional dyspepsia (a condition causing recurring indigestion).  It falls under the pharmacological classifications of gastrointestinal agents, specifically proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and prokinetics.  The mechanism of action involves decreasing stomach acid production (Rabeprazole) and enhancing the movement of the stomach and intestines (Itopride), facilitating faster emptying of the stomach.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no internationally recognized non-proprietary name for this combination. It is often referred to as Rabeprazole and Itopride or Itopride and Rabeprazole.  Brand names vary depending on the region and manufacturer; some examples include Rabepride, Razik-IT, RABISTRUM IT, and Rabexid IT.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Rabeprazole inhibits the H+/K+ ATPase proton pump in gastric parietal cells, reducing gastric acid secretion.  Itopride is a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, increasing acetylcholine levels.  This leads to enhanced gastric motility, accelerated gastric emptying, and improved gastric tone.  Itopride also has antiemetic properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Rabeprazole:**  Absorption begins after the drug leaves the stomach due to its enteric coating. Peak plasma levels are reached in approximately 3.5 hours. It has high plasma protein binding (about 97%).  Metabolism occurs via the CYP450 system in the liver, primarily resulting in two metabolites: a mercapturic acid conjugate and a carboxylic acid. Elimination is primarily through renal excretion (90%) and partly fecal excretion (10%).
* **Itopride:**  It is well-absorbed with an elimination half-life of around 6 hours. Metabolism is mainly through flavin monooxygenase.

**Mode of Action:** Rabeprazole binds to the H+/K+ ATPase, irreversibly inhibiting its activity and reducing gastric acid secretion.  Itopride antagonizes dopamine D2 receptors and inhibits acetylcholinesterase, increasing acetylcholine levels and stimulating gastrointestinal motility.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Rabeprazole primarily through renal excretion; Itopride through both renal and biliary excretion.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One capsule (Rabeprazole 20 mg + Itopride 150 mg) once daily, 30-60 minutes before a meal, preferably in the morning.

#### **Children:**

Use is not recommended for children under 12 years of age. Limited data suggest dosages of 5-20mg Rabeprazole, based on weight, for children older than 1 year, for GERD.  This must only be administered under strict medical supervision.  Itopride safety and efficacy have not been established in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required, but caution should be exercised.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution is advised. Dose adjustments may be needed based on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advised, especially in severe hepatic impairment. Dose adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Care should be taken in patients with Parkinson's disease or a history of movement disorders due to potential exacerbation of symptoms by Itopride.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage guidelines for specific clinical situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not established for this combination.  The standard dosage is usually maintained unless contraindicated by the patient's specific condition.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications might be required based on patient-specific factors such as renal or hepatic dysfunction.

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Headache, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, dizziness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), severe skin reactions, changes in liver function, agranulocytosis.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Osteoporosis, hypomagnesemia, increased risk of *Clostridium difficile* infection, vitamin B12 deficiency (with Rabeprazole).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, agranulocytosis, hepatic dysfunction.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to Rabeprazole, Itopride, or any of the excipients. Gastrointestinal bleeding, mechanical obstruction or perforation, pregnancy, lactation.

## **Drug Interactions**

Rabeprazole can interact with drugs metabolized by the CYP450 system (e.g., warfarin, digoxin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, methotrexate). Itopride may interact with anticholinergic drugs.  Concomitant use of alcohol should be avoided.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Contraindicated in both pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential risks to the fetus/infant.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Rabeprazole inhibits gastric acid secretion; Itopride enhances gastric motility.
* **Side Effects:**  Headache, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness.  Rarely:  allergic reactions, hepatic dysfunction.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, gastrointestinal obstruction/bleeding, pregnancy, lactation.
* **Drug Interactions:**  CYP450 substrates, anticholinergics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
* **Dosage:** One capsule daily before meals.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Liver function tests, magnesium levels.

## **Popular Combinations**

This combination itself is a popular pairing often prescribed together for synergistic effects in managing GERD and dyspepsia.


## **Precautions**

Screen patients for allergies and existing medical conditions. Exercise caution in patients with renal/hepatic impairment, Parkinson's disease, or movement disorders. Advise against alcohol consumption.
