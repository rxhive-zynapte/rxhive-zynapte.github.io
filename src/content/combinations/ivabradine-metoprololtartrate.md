## **Usage**

Ivabradine + Metoprolol Tartrate is prescribed for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris in adult patients with normal sinus rhythm who are already controlled on stable doses of the individual components (Ivabradine and Metoprolol) given concurrently, with Metoprolol at the optimal dose.  It belongs to the pharmacological class of cardiovascular agents, specifically a combination of a beta-blocker (Metoprolol) and a selective and specific I<sub>*f*</sub> current inhibitor (Ivabradine).

The mechanism of action involves a dual approach: Metoprolol blocks beta-adrenergic receptors, reducing heart rate and myocardial contractility, while Ivabradine selectively inhibits the I<sub>*f*</sub> current in the sinoatrial node, further slowing the heart rate.  This combined effect reduces myocardial oxygen demand and improves myocardial perfusion, alleviating angina symptoms.

## **Alternate Names**

This fixed-dose combination (FDC) medication doesn't have an established International Nonproprietary Name (INN).  It's commonly referred to as the Ivabradine/Metoprolol combination or FDC.  A brand name for this combination is Implicor.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Metoprolol decreases heart rate, myocardial contractility, cardiac output, and blood pressure. Ivabradine selectively inhibits the I<sub>*f*</sub> current in the sinoatrial node, slowing diastolic depolarization and thus reducing heart rate.  It has no effect on myocardial contractility, intracardiac conduction, or repolarization.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Both drugs are absorbed orally. Food increases Metoprolol exposure and delays Ivabradine absorption.
* **Metabolism:** Metoprolol is extensively metabolized by the liver, primarily by CYP2D6. Ivabradine is also extensively metabolized by the liver and gut wall, primarily by CYP3A4.
* **Elimination:** Both drugs are primarily eliminated renally, though some metabolites are excreted in feces.


**Mode of Action:** Metoprolol competitively blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, decreasing sympathetic stimulation. Ivabradine specifically inhibits the I<sub>*f*</sub> current, a mixed Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> inward current in the sinoatrial node responsible for pacemaker activity. It does not affect other ionic currents or adrenergic/cholinergic activity.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Metoprolol binds to beta-1 adrenergic receptors.  Ivabradine binds to the I<sub>*f*</sub> channel. Neither drug directly modulates neurotransmitters or inhibits enzymes other than CYP involvement in metabolism.

**Elimination Pathways:** Metoprolol and its metabolites are primarily excreted renally. Ivabradine and its metabolites are also eliminated renally, with some fecal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The recommended dose of Ivabradine + Metoprolol Tartrate is one tablet twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening, taken with meals.  The combination should only be used in patients already stabilized on the individual components at equivalent doses.  Titration should be done with the individual components.


#### **Children:**  

The safety and efficacy in children and adolescents have not been established. No data are available.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Specific dose recommendations for this FDC aren't available, though dosage adjustments may be necessary. Consult individual drug monographs.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Specific dose recommendations for this FDC aren't available, though dosage adjustments may be necessary. Consult individual drug monographs.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with diabetes, other cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory conditions. Consult individual drug monographs.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Specific dosage recommendations for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not available for this FDC.  Consult individual drug monographs for Metoprolol and Ivabradine.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments based on renal/hepatic function, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms should be based on the individual components.  Consult individual drug monographs.

## **Side Effects**

* **Bradycardic Drugs:**  Use with caution with other medications that lower heart rate (e.g., other beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin).
* **Grapefruit juice:** Avoid grapefruit juice, which can increase Ivabradine levels.
* **CYP2D6 Inhibitors/Inducers:**  Can affect Metoprolol metabolism.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Ivabradine is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Metoprolol should be used with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* Monitor heart rate, blood pressure, and ECG.
* Caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.
* Avoid grapefruit juice.
* Patients should report symptoms of bradycardia.
