## **Usage**

- Ketoconazole + Piroctone Olamine is primarily prescribed for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis, commonly known as dandruff.  It can also be used for other fungal skin infections.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antifungal agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Ketoconazole inhibits the synthesis of ergosterol, a crucial component of fungal cell membranes, leading to cell wall disruption and fungal cell death. Piroctone olamine disrupts fungal energy metabolism and oxygen uptake, further contributing to the antifungal effect.  The combination targets *Malassezia globosa*, a fungus implicated in dandruff.

## **Alternate Names**

- Ketoconazole/Piroctone Olamine
- **Brand Names:** Logidruf (lotion and shampoo), Follicure Anti Dandruff Shampoo, Flakeoff Shampoo, Tricodruf Anti-Dandruff Lotion, Magidruf Shampoo.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ketoconazole, a broad-spectrum imidazole antifungal, alters the fungal cell membrane permeability by inhibiting ergosterol synthesis. Piroctone olamine, although its exact mechanism is not fully elucidated, acts as a potent antifungal and antibacterial agent, potentially disrupting cellular respiration.  The combination provides synergistic antifungal activity.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily for topical application, absorption is minimal, reducing systemic side effects.  Minimal systemic absorption occurs with topical application.  For topical application, hepatic/renal impairment generally do not require dose adjustments.  
- **Mode of Action:** Ketoconazole inhibits the fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme lanosterol 14Î±-demethylase,  which is crucial in the biosynthesis of ergosterol, resulting in cell wall damage. Piroctone olamine is believed to interfere with various cellular processes in fungi, including energy production and oxygen uptake.  
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Limited systemic absorption after topical use means minimal metabolism or renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Apply the shampoo or lotion to the affected scalp area 2-3 times per week.
- Leave on for 3-5 minutes before rinsing thoroughly.  Some sources recommend applying once or twice daily depending on the formulation.  Duration of treatment can vary based on the formulation and severity of infection but typically 2-4 weeks.

#### **Children:**
