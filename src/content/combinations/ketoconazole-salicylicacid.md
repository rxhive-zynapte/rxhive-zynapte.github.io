## **Usage**

Ketoconazole + Salicylic Acid is prescribed for the treatment of fungal skin infections, seborrheic dermatitis, dandruff, and other scalp conditions like psoriasis.  It is classified as an antifungal and keratolytic agent. The combination works by eliminating the causative fungus (often *Malassezia* species) and exfoliating the skin to remove scales and flakes.

## **Alternate Names**

No commonly used alternate names exist for this combination product. Brand names may vary depending on the region and manufacturer. Examples include Nizoral A-D and Ketonax-S.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ketoconazole inhibits the synthesis of ergosterol, a crucial component of fungal cell membranes, leading to fungal cell death. Salicylic acid promotes the shedding of the stratum corneum, reducing scaling and flaking. It also possesses anti-inflammatory properties, soothing irritated skin.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Ketoconazole is minimally absorbed systemically following topical application, limiting systemic side effects. Salicylic acid is absorbed percutaneously, with the extent of absorption depending on factors like concentration, vehicle, and application site. Both drugs are metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted mainly through the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** Ketoconazole interferes with fungal cell membrane synthesis by inhibiting the cytochrome P450 enzyme lanosterol 14Î±-demethylase. This disruption alters membrane permeability, leading to leakage of intracellular components and cell death. Salicylic acid breaks down the intercellular cement between corneocytes, promoting exfoliation.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

For topical creams, lotions, or gels: Apply a thin layer to the affected area twice daily or as directed by a physician.  For shampoos: Apply twice weekly for 2 to 4 weeks, then as needed for maintenance.

#### **Children:**

Use in children under 12 is generally not recommended unless prescribed by a doctor.  If prescribed, the dosage will be adjusted based on age and weight. Pediatric safety should be carefully considered.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required but monitor for skin irritation.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution should be exercised due to the potential for salicylic acid accumulation.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution should be used as both drugs are primarily metabolized in the liver.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No explicit dosage recommendations exist, but individual patient assessment is crucial.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  The provided sources do not specify dosages for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. This medication is primarily designed for topical dermatological use and therefore, its application in such clinical scenarios is not recommended.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment and those with specific skin sensitivities.


## **Side Effects**
