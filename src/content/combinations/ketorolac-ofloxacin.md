## **Usage**

Ketorolac + Ofloxacin is an ophthalmic solution prescribed for bacterial eye infections and to alleviate pain and inflammation following ocular surgeries such as cataract or corneal refractive surgery.  It's also used to manage allergic conjunctivitis.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Ofloxacin: Fluoroquinolone antibiotic
* Ketorolac: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)

**Mechanism of Action:**

Ofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair, thus halting bacterial growth. Ketorolac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, thereby mitigating pain and inflammation.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is often referred to as "Ofloxacin and Ketorolac ophthalmic solution."  Brand names may vary regionally; some examples include Kapiket-OF,  MYKETOL-D, and Ovlox KT.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ofloxacin exerts its bactericidal effect by disrupting bacterial DNA replication.  Ketorolac's anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions result from COX enzyme inhibition, decreasing prostaglandin production.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The ophthalmic administration results in limited systemic absorption of both drugs.  Ofloxacin is primarily excreted renally, with some hepatic metabolism. Ketorolac is metabolized in the liver and excreted via the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** Ofloxacin targets bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Ketorolac inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.

**Elimination Pathways:** Ofloxacin is predominantly excreted renally, with some hepatic metabolism via CYP enzymes. Ketorolac undergoes hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Instill one drop in the affected eye(s) four times a day. The treatment duration typically ranges from 24 hours post-surgery up to 2 weeks or for 7 days for infections, as directed by the physician.  

#### **Children:**

For children aged 2 years and older, the dosage is generally the same as for adults: one drop in the affected eye(s) four times a day.  Use in children under 2 is generally not recommended. Pediatric use requires careful consideration of benefits versus risks and should be determined by an ophthalmologist.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically required, but monitoring for adverse events is crucial.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustment may be necessary, potentially decreasing frequency or dose based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised. Closely monitor liver function tests. Dose adjustment may be needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Patients with conditions like diabetes, arthritis, or bleeding disorders should be monitored for any exacerbation of their condition.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage for specific clinical situations is typically the standard dosage: 1 drop four times daily in the affected eye(s). The duration of treatment might vary depending on the indication.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications should be considered in cases of renal or hepatic impairment, based on the severity of the dysfunction.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Eye discomfort, transient burning or stinging sensation, blurred vision, redness, itching, tearing, dryness, and photophobia.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema), corneal ulceration or perforation, vision loss, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Prolonged use of topical ofloxacin can potentially lead to fungal overgrowth or the emergence of resistant bacterial strains.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any severe hypersensitivity reaction, significant vision changes, or signs of corneal damage necessitate immediate discontinuation of the drug and prompt medical evaluation.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to fluoroquinolones, NSAIDs, or any components of the formulation.  Active corneal ulcers.

## **Drug Interactions**

Other NSAIDs: Increased risk of bleeding or gastrointestinal adverse effects. Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin): Elevated bleeding risk. Oral hypoglycemics: Potential alterations in glucose control. Theophylline:  May increase serum theophylline levels.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category: C (consult a doctor before use; potential fetal risks exist). Excretion in breast milk is possible; exercise caution or consider discontinuing the drug or breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Ofloxacin: Inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Ketorolac: Inhibits COX enzymes.
* **Side Effects:** Eye irritation, transient blurred vision, headache, stinging, burning.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to components, active corneal ulcer.
* **Drug Interactions:** Other NSAIDs, anticoagulants, oral hypoglycemics, theophylline.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use cautiously under medical supervision.
* **Dosage:** 1 drop four times daily in the affected eye(s).
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Observe for allergic reactions, corneal changes, vision changes, and treatment efficacy.

## **Popular Combinations**

Ketorolac + Ofloxacin is itself a common combination.  Combining it with other ophthalmic medications is generally avoided unless specifically directed by an ophthalmologist.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Avoid contact lenses during treatment. Monitor for allergic reactions and corneal or vision changes.

* **Specific Populations:** Pregnant/breastfeeding women:  Use with caution after consulting a physician. Children:  Use with caution and only in those aged 2 or older. Elderly: Close monitoring for adverse effects is essential.

* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Temporary blurred vision may impair driving or operating machinery.
