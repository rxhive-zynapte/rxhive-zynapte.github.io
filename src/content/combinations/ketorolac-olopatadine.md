## **Usage**

Ketorolac + Olopatadine ophthalmic solution is prescribed for the short-term treatment of the signs and symptoms of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC).  It is particularly useful when both the allergic/inflammatory components and the pain associated with this condition need to be addressed.

- **Pharmacological classification**: This is a combination product containing a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and an antihistamine.
    - **Ketorolac**: NSAID (analgesic, anti-inflammatory)
    - **Olopatadine**: Antihistamine, mast cell stabilizer

- **Mechanism of action**:
    - **Ketorolac**: Inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes, thereby reducing prostaglandin synthesis, which plays a key role in inflammation and pain.
    - **Olopatadine**:  A relatively selective H1-receptor antagonist and inhibits the release of histamine from mast cells. Histamine is a key mediator in allergic reactions.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no officially recognized alternate name for the combination product itself.  The individual components may be referred to by their chemical names: Ketorolac tromethamine and Olopatadine hydrochloride.  Several brand names exist, but they can vary regionally. Some examples include Kapiket-OL and Levokap in India, and other brands internationally.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**:  The combination exerts a synergistic effect by targeting both the inflammatory and allergic pathways contributing to SAC symptoms.
    - Ketorolac's anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions alleviate pain, redness, and swelling.
    - Olopatadine's antihistaminic activity and mast cell stabilization reduce itching, tearing, and other allergic manifestations.

- **Pharmacokinetics**:
    - **Absorption**:  Following topical ocular administration, both drugs achieve therapeutic concentrations in ocular tissues. Systemic absorption is minimal.
    - **Metabolism**:  Limited information is available regarding the metabolism of the combination product when administered topically.  Olopatadine is partially metabolized, while ketorolac undergoes more extensive hepatic metabolism.
    - **Elimination**:  Primarily renal excretion for both drugs, with some hepatic contribution.

- **Mode of action**:
    - **Ketorolac**:  Inhibits COX enzymes, which catalyze the formation of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid. This reduces the inflammatory and pain response.
    - **Olopatadine**: Antagonizes H1 receptors, preventing histamine from binding and triggering downstream allergic effects.  It also stabilizes mast cells, preventing the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  One drop in each affected eye twice a day, approximately 6-8 hours apart.

#### **Children (2 years and older):**  One drop in each affected eye twice a day, approximately 6-8 hours apart for 0.1% olopatadine and once a day for 0.2% olopatadine. Use in children under 2 years old must be determined by a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients**: No specific dosage adjustments are typically required. Monitor for potential systemic side effects, particularly if there is renal impairment.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Exercise caution and adjust dosage as needed based on renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Exercise caution. Closely monitor hepatic function. Dosage adjustment might be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Carefully assess individual cases, considering underlying medical conditions, potential drug interactions, and associated risks.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is not typically used in the clinical settings you listed (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations). Its primary indication is for seasonal allergic conjunctivitis.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Individualized assessment is required.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Ocular: Burning or stinging, blurred vision, eye irritation, dry eyes, foreign body sensation
- Systemic: Headache, bad taste in the mouth

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Ocular: Corneal complications, vision changes
- Systemic: Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), breathing difficulties

### **Long-Term Effects**

Prolonged use of topical NSAIDs can potentially increase the risk of corneal complications.



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to ketorolac, olopatadine, or any component of the formulation.
- Patients with active corneal ulcers or other corneal defects.
- History of asthma, nasal polyps, or angioedema triggered by aspirin or other NSAIDs.
- Patients with known bleeding tendencies or those taking anticoagulants.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Other NSAIDs (increased risk of bleeding)
- Anticoagulants (increased risk of bleeding)
- High doses of aspirin (increased risk of bleeding)


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy**: The safety of this combination during pregnancy has not been established. Use only if clearly needed and under close medical supervision.
- **Breastfeeding**: Ketorolac and olopatadine may be excreted in breast milk.  Exercise caution when administering to breastfeeding mothers. Consider the potential risk to the infant.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action**:  Ketorolac (NSAID) inhibits COX enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis. Olopatadine (antihistamine, mast cell stabilizer) blocks H1 receptors and prevents histamine release.
- **Side Effects**: Burning/stinging, blurred vision, dry eyes, headache, bad taste.
- **Contraindications**: Hypersensitivity, corneal problems, aspirin/NSAID sensitivity, bleeding disorders.
- **Drug Interactions**: Other NSAIDs, anticoagulants.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding**: Use with caution.
- **Dosage**: One drop in each affected eye twice daily (6-8 hours apart). Adjust as needed.
- **Monitoring Parameters**:  Ocular signs and symptoms, vision changes, systemic side effects (if any).

## **Popular Combinations**

This is already a combination product. Its use as a standalone treatment is typically preferred in its indicated condition.



## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions**: Assess for allergies, corneal integrity, renal/hepatic function.
- **Specific Populations**:  See "Dosage - Special Cases."
- **Lifestyle Considerations**: May cause transient blurred vision. Advise patients to avoid driving or operating machinery immediately after administration.
