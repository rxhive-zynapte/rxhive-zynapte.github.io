## **Usage**

Ketorolac + Tramadol is prescribed for short-term management of moderate to severe acute pain, typically post-operative pain, that requires opioid-level analgesia.

It is classified pharmacologically as a combination analgesic comprising a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and an opioid analgesic.

The mechanism of action involves dual pathways: Ketorolac inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, reducing inflammation and pain, while Tramadol binds to opioid receptors and inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, modulating pain signals at the spinal level.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no formally recognized alternate name for this specific combination. However, it is comprised of Ketorolac (brand name Toradol, although discontinued in the U.S.) and Tramadol (brand names Ultram, ConZip). The combination itself is not typically marketed under a single brand name, but may appear as such through compounding pharmacies.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ketorolac exerts its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects through non-selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis. Tramadol acts as a centrally acting analgesic. It is a weak mu-opioid receptor agonist and also inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, enhancing descending inhibitory pain pathways.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Ketorolac is rapidly absorbed following oral or intramuscular administration. It undergoes hepatic metabolism and renal excretion. Tramadol is also well-absorbed orally and undergoes hepatic metabolism, including via CYP2D6, to its active metabolite, O-desmethyltramadol. Both drugs and their metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine.

**Mode of Action:** Ketorolac's action on COX enzymes reduces the production of prostaglandins, key mediators of inflammation and pain. Tramadol's binding to mu-opioid receptors and effects on serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake decrease pain perception in the central nervous system.

**Elimination Pathways:** Ketorolac is primarily eliminated through renal excretion, while Tramadol and its metabolites are eliminated mainly through the kidneys, with a small portion eliminated in the feces.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The dosing regimen varies based on individual patient needs and the route of administration. Typically, Ketorolac is initiated parenterally (IV or IM) and then transitioned to oral administration if necessary. The oral combination of Ketorolac and Tramadol is not FDA approved, so dosing guidance is based on individual components. Typical Ketorolac oral dosing is 10 mg every 4-6 hours, not to exceed 40 mg/day, for up to 5 days. Tramadol oral dosing can vary depending on the formulation and pain severity, and should be used at the lowest effective dose. Combining these medications should only be done under the guidance of a healthcare professional and dosing should be carefully monitored.

#### **Children:** Use in children is not generally recommended due to limited safety data, especially for Ketorolac.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Close monitoring is recommended due to increased risk of adverse effects. Lower doses may be considered.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is necessary for both Ketorolac and Tramadol due to altered clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, and dose adjustments may be required, particularly for Tramadol.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is necessary in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, peptic ulcer disease, asthma, and bleeding disorders.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosages for specific clinical use cases should be determined by individual patient needs and the clinical context.  Postoperative pain is the primary indication for Ketorolac. Tramadol may be employed in a broader range of pain conditions. The combination is not specifically indicated for any particular clinical procedure, and its use would depend on the individual patient's needs and risk factors.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are necessary based on renal/hepatic function, age, and other patient-specific factors. Genetic polymorphisms affecting CYP2D6 activity can influence Tramadol metabolism and necessitate adjustments.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, constipation, stomach pain, vomiting.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, renal impairment, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), serotonin syndrome, seizures, respiratory depression, cardiovascular events.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic kidney disease, gastrointestinal ulcers, opioid dependence.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute renal failure, respiratory arrest.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to either drug, active peptic ulcer disease, recent gastrointestinal bleeding, asthma,  bleeding disorders, advanced renal impairment, concurrent use of MAOIs, during labor and delivery.

## **Drug Interactions**

Other NSAIDs, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs, tricyclic antidepressants, alcohol, opioids, lithium, methotrexate, corticosteroids, antihypertensives.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Ketorolac is contraindicated in late pregnancy. Tramadol use during pregnancy can cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. Both drugs pass into breast milk; breastfeeding is not recommended.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Ketorolac: COX inhibition, Tramadol: Mu-opioid receptor agonist and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, constipation, gastrointestinal bleeding, renal impairment, serotonin syndrome, seizures, respiratory depression.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, active peptic ulcer disease, bleeding disorders, pregnancy (late term), breastfeeding.
- **Drug Interactions:**  NSAIDs, anticoagulants, SSRIs, MAOIs, alcohol.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid during pregnancy (especially late term) and breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:**  Individualized; see dosing section.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, liver function, pain scores, respiratory rate, signs of opioid toxicity.

## **Popular Combinations**

While not a "popular combination," Tramadol is sometimes combined with Acetaminophen.  Ketorolac is typically used alone for its intended purpose (short-term post-operative pain relief).


## **Precautions**

Careful patient selection is critical, considering renal/hepatic function, age, and comorbid conditions. Monitor for adverse effects and drug interactions.
