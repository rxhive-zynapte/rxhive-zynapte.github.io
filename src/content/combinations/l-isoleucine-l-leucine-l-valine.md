      How does L-Isoleucine + L-Leucine + L-Valine work?**

      **A:** These essential amino acids support protein synthesis, muscle
      repair, energy production, and blood sugar regulation. L-Leucine activates
      the mTOR pathway, which stimulates muscle protein synthesis.

## **Usage**

- L-Isoleucine + L-Leucine + L-Valine is prescribed for the management and treatment of nutritional deficiencies, particularly those involving branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs).  It is also used in conditions that affect muscle mass and function, such as liver disease, chronic kidney disease, cancer, and HIV/AIDS. Athletes and individuals looking to improve muscle mass and performance may also use this supplement.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Nutritional Supplement, Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs).
- **Mechanism of Action:** L-Isoleucine, L-Leucine, and L-Valine are essential amino acids that the body cannot produce on its own.  This combination provides these essential nutrients directly, supporting protein synthesis, muscle growth and repair, energy production, and blood sugar regulation. L-Leucine specifically activates the mTOR pathway, stimulating muscle protein synthesis.


## **Alternate Names**

- Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs)
- BCAA
- 2-Amino-3-Methylvaleric Acid (Isoleucine)
- 2-Amino-4-Methylvaleric Acid (Leucine)
- Isoleucine Ethyl Ester HCl
- L-Isoleucine
- L-Leucine
- L-Leucine Pyroglutamate
- L-Valine
- Leucine
- Leucine Ethyl Ester HCl
- Leucine Isovaleric Acid
- Leucine Methyl Ester HCl
- Valine
- **Brand names:** Livact, Hepsure, Celevida Liv BC, Gramoz BC, Lamino Hepa


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** BCAAs are involved in protein synthesis, particularly in skeletal muscle, contributing to muscle growth and repair. They also influence blood glucose regulation by promoting glucose uptake by muscles and play a role in energy production, especially during physical activity.  BCAAs can compete with other amino acids, impacting neurotransmitter production (serotonin, dopamine).
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  BCAAs are absorbed through the gut and metabolized primarily in muscle tissue, unlike most other amino acids that are processed in the liver. They are involved in various metabolic pathways contributing to energy production. The specific pathways of elimination for each BCAA haven't been fully elucidated in the provided information.
- **Mode of Action:** L-Leucine acts on the mTOR pathway, a key regulator of cell growth and protein synthesis.  BCAAs are also involved in gluconeogenesis, insulin secretion, and ammonia detoxification. Their impact on neurotransmitter balance can also influence mood and cognition.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Specific receptor interactions or enzyme inhibitions have not been detailed in the provided information, except for the effect of L-Leucine on the mTOR pathway.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Primary elimination pathways aren't explicitly described, but it's mentioned that BCAAs are primarily metabolized within muscle tissue.
