## **Usage**

L-Isoleucine and L-Leucine, often administered in combination with L-Valine, are branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) primarily prescribed for managing nutritional deficiencies, particularly in patients with liver disease (hepatic cirrhosis and encephalopathy), chronic kidney disease, and those on hemodialysis. They are also utilized in patients with certain cancers, HIV/AIDS, and those experiencing muscle wasting (cachexia).  While sometimes used to enhance athletic performance, decrease fatigue, minimize muscle wastage, and promote muscle growth and recovery, robust evidence for these uses is lacking.  Their pharmacological classification falls under nutritional supplements or essential amino acid replacements. The mechanism of action involves providing the body with essential amino acids it cannot synthesize, crucial for protein synthesis, muscle metabolism, and various metabolic processes.

## **Alternate Names**

Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs).

A specific combination of L-Isoleucine, L-Leucine, and L-Valine might be marketed under brand names such as Livact Granules or Kidmin.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** BCAAs, especially leucine, stimulate protein synthesis and inhibit protein breakdown in skeletal muscle. They also influence glucose metabolism, ammonia detoxification, and may offer neuroprotection by inhibiting aromatic amino acids uptake via the blood-brain barrier.

**Pharmacokinetics:** BCAAs are absorbed primarily in the small intestine and transported to peripheral tissues, mainly muscle, unlike other amino acids primarily metabolized by the liver.  They are involved in protein synthesis, or act as precursors for nitrogen and carbon-containing molecules. Their elimination pathway is primarily renal, and involves transamination and conversion of nitrogen to urea.

**Mode of Action:**  Leucine activates the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway, crucial for cell growth and survival. This stimulates protein synthesis. BCAAs contribute to energy production during physical activity through breakdown in the muscles.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Specific details on receptor binding or enzyme inhibition are limited in the context of their role as nutritional supplements, although the mechanism is primarily through influencing metabolic pathways rather than direct receptor interaction.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Dosage varies depending on the indication and patient's condition, and needs to be determined by a doctor or dietitian.  The standard adult dosage for Livact Granules, for instance, is one packet (containing 952mg L-Isoleucine, 1904mg L-Leucine, and 1144mg L-Valine) three times a day after meals. For improving hypoalbuminemia in patients with hepatic cirrhosis, 15-20g/day (0.3g BCAA/kg body weight) has been suggested.  For athletes, 4-10g/day before and after training has been investigated.

#### **Children:**

Safety and efficacy not established in children under 10 years of age, although some sources list the use in children over 12 years old.  Dosage should be determined by a doctor or dietitian for children and adolescents based on age, body weight, and the condition. 

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to potentially reduced physiological function and susceptibility to metabolic disorders like elevated blood ammonia.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution due to the potential for increased ammonia levels.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Indicated for patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis and hypoalbuminemia.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution advised in patients with diabetes due to potential impact on blood sugar.  Those with Maple Syrup Urine Disease should not use BCAAs.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosages vary depending on the specific medical context and should be determined by a clinician. For example, in intensive care unit (ICU) settings, the dosage would depend on the patient's nutritional needs and metabolic status.  For liver disease, the dosage might be significantly higher than for supporting muscle protein synthesis in patients with other conditions.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications needed based on renal/hepatic function, metabolic disorders, genetic polymorphisms, or age. Consult with a physician or dietitian for individualized dosage adjustments. 

## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain/discomfort, fatigue, headache.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, anaphylaxis), elevated ammonia levels (fatigue, headache, nausea), worsened kidney or liver function.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential long-term effects are not well-established, but may include metabolic imbalances with excessive or prolonged use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions and metabolic disturbances are the most serious ADRs and require immediate attention.

## **Contraindications**

Maple syrup urine disease, branched-chain ketoaciduria, hypersensitivity to any component. Use with caution or avoid in severe liver or kidney failure.

## **Drug Interactions**

Potential interactions with levodopa (Parkinson's disease medication), antidiabetic medications (metformin, insulin), corticosteroids (prednisone), and thyroid hormones (levothyroxine).

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Safety not established. Consult with a doctor before use.
