## **Usage**

- This combination is primarily prescribed for the treatment of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in women of reproductive age. It addresses hormonal imbalances, insulin resistance, and metabolic disturbances commonly associated with PCOS.  It may also be used to improve ovulation and regulate menstrual cycles. It helps to lower high homocysteine levels, improve hormonal balance, aid follicular development, improve egg quality, and restore ovulation in women.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination includes multiple classifications:
    - Metformin: Biguanide, Antidiabetic
    - Myo-inositol & D-Chiro-inositol: Insulin sensitizers
    - L-Methylfolate: Vitamin, Folate derivative
    - Methylcobalamin: Vitamin, Cobalamin (Vitamin B12)

- **Mechanism of Action:**  The components work synergistically:
    - *Metformin* decreases hepatic glucose production, increases insulin sensitivity, and improves glucose uptake.
    - *Myo-inositol & D-Chiro-inositol* improve insulin signaling, especially in the ovaries, regulating ovarian function and oocyte quality.
    - *L-Methylfolate* reduces elevated homocysteine levels, mitigating cardiovascular risks.
    - *Methylcobalamin* is crucial for nerve function, DNA synthesis, and homocysteine metabolism.

## **Alternate Names**

- Metformin + Myo-inositol + D-Chiro-inositol + L-Methylfolate + Methylcobalamin
- Brand names like Oosure-M, Met-Innovfol, and Ovalife Met.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**
    - Metformin reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis and increases insulin sensitivity.
    - Inositols influence insulin signaling pathways.
    - L-methylfolate and methylcobalamin are cofactors in metabolic processes.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Absorption, metabolism, and elimination pathways vary for each component.
    - Metformin is partially absorbed and renally excreted.
    - Inositols are absorbed and utilized intracellularly.
    - L-methylfolate and methylcobalamin are metabolized and excreted via various pathways.

- **Mode of Action:**
    - Metformin's precise mechanism is not fully understood but involves AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation.
    - Inositols act as second messengers in insulin signaling.
    - L-methylfolate is involved in one-carbon metabolism.
    - Methylcobalamin participates in DNA synthesis and methylation reactions.

- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**
    - Metformin may indirectly affect insulin receptor activity.
    - Inositols may influence insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins.
    - L-methylfolate and methylcobalamin do not directly bind to receptors but act as coenzymes.

- **Elimination Pathways:**
    - Metformin: Primarily renal excretion.
    - Inositols: Metabolism and excretion not fully characterized.
    - L-methylfolate and methylcobalamin: Various pathways.


## **Dosage**

Dosage should be individualized based on patient needs and clinical response.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Typical dosage is one tablet containing the combined components once or twice daily with meals.
- Exact dosages of individual components vary based on the specific formulation.
