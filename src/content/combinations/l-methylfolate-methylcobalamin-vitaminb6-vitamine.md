## **Usage**

This combination of vitamins is primarily used to address vitamin deficiencies, particularly those involving folate, B12, and B6. It may be prescribed for conditions like:

*   **Megaloblastic anemia:** A type of anemia characterized by large, immature red blood cells, often due to folate or B12 deficiency.
*   **Hyperhomocysteinemia:** Elevated levels of homocysteine, an amino acid linked to cardiovascular disease.
*   **Peripheral neuropathy:** Nerve damage, sometimes a consequence of vitamin B12 deficiency and/or diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
*   **Depression:** Adjunctive therapy with antidepressants in patients with suboptimal folate levels.
*   **Nutritional deficiencies:** To ensure adequate levels of necessary vitamins.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This combination is classified as vitamin supplements, hematinics (for blood-related conditions), and metabolic agents.

**Mechanism of Action:** The vitamins work synergistically:

*   **L-Methylfolate:** The biologically active form of folic acid, is essential for DNA and RNA synthesis, cell division, and red blood cell formation.  
*   **Methylcobalamin:** The active form of vitamin B12, is crucial for nerve function, DNA synthesis, and red blood cell maturation.
*   **Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine):**  Involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, red blood cell formation, and homocysteine metabolism.  
*   **Vitamin E (Tocopherol):** Acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from oxidative stress and damage.

## **Alternate Names**

*   L-5-Methyltetrahydrofolate (L-5-MTHF) + Methylcobalamin + Pyridoxine Hydrochloride + Vitamin E
*   Levomefolate Calcium + Methylcobalamin + Pyridoxine + Vitamin E
*   (6S)-5-Methyltetrahydrofolic acid, calcium salt + Methylcobalamin + Vitamin B6 + Tocopherol
* Metanx (brand name)

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  These vitamins act as coenzymes and substrates in vital metabolic pathways, influencing cellular growth, nerve function, and red blood cell production.  They contribute to DNA/RNA synthesis, neurotransmitter production, homocysteine regulation, and cellular protection against oxidative damage.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:**  The components are absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract. L-Methylfolate has better bioavailability than folic acid. Vitamin E absorption is enhanced by dietary fat.
*   **Metabolism:** Each vitamin undergoes metabolic transformations. L-methylfolate doesn't require conversion to its active form unlike folic acid. B12 needs intrinsic factor for absorption.  B6 is metabolized in the liver.
*   **Elimination:** B vitamins are mainly excreted through the kidneys. Vitamins D and E are stored in the liver and adipose tissue, and their metabolites are excreted through bile and urine.

**Mode of Action:** The combination acts at a cellular level. L-methylfolate and methylcobalamin participate in DNA synthesis and cell division. Vitamin B6 acts as a cofactor for various enzymes, including those involved in neurotransmitter synthesis and homocysteine metabolism. Vitamin E acts as a free radical scavenger, protecting cell membranes from oxidative damage.

## **Dosage**

Dosage needs to be tailored to the individual patient and the specific condition being treated.  There is not a standard dose for this combination of vitamins.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* Common dosages: 1 tablet or capsule containing specified amounts of each vitamin, taken once or twice daily.

#### **Children:**

*   Dosage needs to be determined by a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients, Patients with Renal Impairment/Hepatic Dysfunction, Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments are made based on organ function, other medical conditions, and concomitant medications. Close monitoring is necessary, particularly in the case of renal/hepatic impairment.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is not typically used in acute medical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary role is in the long-term management of chronic conditions linked to vitamin deficiencies.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

*   Mild gastrointestinal discomfort (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort).
*   Allergic reactions (skin rash, itching) for some individuals.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

*   Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, dizziness, difficulty breathing).
*   Hypercalcemia (vitamin D toxicity at high doses).
*   Peripheral neuropathy (vitamin B6 toxicity at high doses).



## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to any component of the combination.
*   Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (for combinations containing cyanocobalamin).
*   Untreated vitamin B12 deficiency anemia.

## **Drug Interactions**

*   Anti-seizure medications (phenytoin, carbamazepine).
*   Certain antibiotics (tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones).
*   Proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, pantoprazole).
*   Levodopa.
*   Methotrexate.
*   Alcohol (may impair absorption and increase dizziness/drowsiness).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

This combination is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding, especially L-methylfolate which is crucial during pregnancy. However, consultation with a doctor is always recommended before use.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** Vitamins and nutrients act as coenzymes, substrates, and antioxidants in essential metabolic processes.
*   **Side Effects:** Generally well-tolerated; mild gastrointestinal upset possible. Rare but serious side effects include allergic reactions, hypercalcemia (vitamin D), and peripheral neuropathy (vitamin B6 at high doses).
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity; Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (if cyanocobalamin is present); untreated B12 deficiency anemia.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Anti-seizure drugs, certain antibiotics, PPIs, levodopa, methotrexate, alcohol.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe; consult a doctor before use.
*   **Dosage:** Individualized; varies by condition and patient characteristics.
*   **Monitoring Parameters:** Vitamin levels (B12, B6, D, folate, homocysteine) should be monitored regularly.

## **Popular Combinations**

This combination of vitamins frequently appears together, particularly in supplements and medical foods. The rationale is to address inter-related metabolic pathways and nutritional deficiencies comprehensively.



## **Precautions**

*   **General Precautions:** Screen for allergies and existing medical conditions, including liver/kidney disease and metabolic disorders.
*   **Specific Populations:** Close monitoring is necessary in pregnant/breastfeeding women, children, and the elderly. Alcohol and certain medication use should be reviewed.
*   **Lifestyle:** A balanced diet and moderate sun exposure (for Vitamin D) are beneficial. Excessive alcohol should be avoided.
