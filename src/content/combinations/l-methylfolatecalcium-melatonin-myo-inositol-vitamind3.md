## **Usage**

- This combination is primarily prescribed as a nutritional supplement to address deficiencies and support overall health, especially in women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). It helps regulate menstrual cycles, improve insulin sensitivity, and enhance egg quality.  It may also be used in women undergoing intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) procedures.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Nutritional Supplement, Hormone Regulator
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination works by improving insulin sensitivity, regulating hormone levels, promoting egg maturation and quality, and supporting regular menstruation.  Melatonin component helps with sleep regulation.

## **Alternate Names** 

- Myo-Inositol + L-Methylfolate Calcium + Vitamin D3 + Melatonin
- Myo-inositol,l-methylfolate,vitamind3, melatonin tablets
- Follical
- Mynosit
- Nixha.
- Some formulations may also include additional ingredients.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Myo-inositol improves insulin sensitivity and ovarian function. L-Methylfolate, the active form of folate, is crucial for DNA/RNA synthesis and cell growth, lowering homocysteine levels. Vitamin D3 aids calcium absorption and bone health. Melatonin regulates sleep-wake cycles.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Absorption, metabolism, and elimination pathways are similar to individual components.  Myo-inositol is readily absorbed and distributed.  L-methylfolate undergoes hepatic metabolism. Vitamin D3 is absorbed in the gut and stored in the liver and adipose tissues and it is converted into its active form in the kidneys. It is excreted in bile and feces. Melatonin is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract and is metabolized in the liver by CYP1A enzymes. Most of the melatonin is excreted in urine as metabolites. Specific pharmacokinetic data for this combination product are limited.
- **Mode of Action:** Myo-inositol may influence cellular signal transduction pathways and improve insulin signaling, potentially by activating specific enzymes like PI3K.  L-methylfolate acts as a substrate for enzymatic reactions and is involved in one-carbon metabolism. Vitamin D3 acts by binding to vitamin D receptors and influencing gene transcription and calcium absorption. Melatonin binds to its receptors in the brain, regulating circadian rhythm and sleep.


## **Dosage**

Dosage information for this specific combination product is limited and varies by brand formulation.  **Always follow the dosage prescribed by the physician or as directed on the product packaging.**
