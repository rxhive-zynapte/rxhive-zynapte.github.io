## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for supporting liver health and function, particularly in conditions like:
    - Acute and chronic hepatitis
    - Chronic alcoholic liver damage
    - Fatty liver (hepatic steatosis)
    - Jaundice
    - Liver cirrhosis
    - Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Hepatoprotective, Anti-oxidant, Ammonia-lowering agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination works synergistically to protect and regenerate the liver.  L-ornithine L-aspartate reduces elevated ammonia levels, metadoxine acts as an antioxidant and improves liver function by increasing the desaturase enzyme, restoring ATP synthesis, and improving redox balance. Silymarin protects the liver from free radical damage and enhances glutathione and protein synthesis, which helps in the production of new liver cells. Vitamin B6 supports various metabolic processes, including protein metabolism and enzyme activity, that are important for liver function.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific four-ingredient combination. However, each individual component has its own synonyms.
- **Brand Names:**  A few brand names for products containing this combination, or a close variation, are:
- Liviz
- Reheptin
- B Liv
- Livopill DS (with added folic acid)
There may be other regional or international brand names.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**
    - L-Ornithine L-Aspartate: Reduces elevated blood ammonia levels by participating in the urea cycle, where ammonia is converted into urea for excretion. This is crucial in managing hepatic encephalopathy.
    - Metadoxine: Improves the balance of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in the liver, promoting healthy liver function. Additionally, it aids in the detoxification of alcohol and acetaldehyde.
    - Silymarin: Protects liver cells by acting as an antioxidant. It also supports liver regeneration by stimulating protein synthesis.
    - Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine): A crucial cofactor for various enzymes involved in liver metabolism, it contributes to overall liver health.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Absorption: Orally administered, with absorption profiles varying slightly for each component.
    - Metabolism: Each component undergoes hepatic metabolism via different pathways, although specific details might vary depending on the formulation.
    - Elimination: Primarily renal excretion, although some biliary excretion may occur.
- **Mode of Action:**
    -  L-Ornithine L-Aspartate increases the synthesis of glutamine, lowering the concentration of ammonia, a toxic byproduct of protein metabolism.
    - Metadoxine acts by enhancing the desaturase enzyme activity, restoring ATP synthesis, and improving redox balance of hepatocytes.
    - Silymarin prevents hepatic lipid peroxidation, increasing glutathione and protein synthesis.
    - Vitamin B6 serves as a cofactor for enzymatic activities necessary for proper liver function.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** L-ornithine L-aspartate influences urea cycle enzymes, while metadoxine interacts with enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism. Silymarin interacts with cell membranes and intracellular pathways, while Vitamin B6 modulates enzymatic reactions.
