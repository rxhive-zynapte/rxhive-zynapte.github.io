## **Usage**

- This combination is prescribed for the treatment and management of various liver diseases, including:
    - Acute and chronic hepatitis
    - Chronic alcoholic liver damage
    - Fatty liver (hepatic steatosis)
    - Jaundice
    - Liver cirrhosis
    - Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
    - Hepatic encephalopathy
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Hepatoprotective, detoxifying agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination works through multiple pathways to protect and regenerate the liver. L-ornithine L-aspartate reduces ammonia levels, metadoxine improves liver metabolism and reduces alcohol-induced damage, and silymarin acts as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination. However, the individual components may be referred to by their chemical names or other synonyms.
- **Brand Names:**  Numerous brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and specific formulation. Some examples based on the sources include: Livopill-DS, Alcohep, Extol, Somaliv, Reheptin, and Mediteanox Liverelief.  (Note: Brand names can vary by region.)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**
    - **L-Ornithine L-Aspartate:** Participates in the urea cycle, converting ammonia into urea and glutamine for excretion, thus reducing hyperammonemia associated with liver disease. Promotes glutamine synthesis, which is essential for various metabolic processes in the liver.
    - **Metadoxine:** Increases the activity of enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism, leading to faster clearance of alcohol from the body and reducing alcohol-induced liver damage. Restores the balance of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in the liver. May improve liver enzyme function.
    - **Silymarin:** Antioxidant, protecting liver cells from free radical damage. Anti-inflammatory, reducing inflammation in the liver. Antifibrotic, potentially preventing or slowing down the progression of liver fibrosis. May stimulate protein synthesis and help in the regeneration of liver cells.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Specific pharmacokinetic data for the combined formulation is limited. Each component has its own absorption, metabolism, and elimination profile. Generally, these components are absorbed orally and primarily metabolized in the liver, with elimination mainly through renal or hepatic routes.
- **Mode of Action:**
    - L-ornithine L-aspartate facilitates ammonia detoxification by increasing the rate of urea cycle activity.
    - Metadoxine enhances alcohol metabolism.
    - Silymarin's antioxidant effects occur through free radical scavenging. Its anti-inflammatory activity may involve modulation of inflammatory mediators.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal and hepatic.
