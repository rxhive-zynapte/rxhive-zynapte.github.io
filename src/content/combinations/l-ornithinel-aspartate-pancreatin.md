      How does this combination medication work in hepatic encephalopathy?**

      **A:** It works by reducing the level of ammonia in the blood, a toxin
      that contributes to the development of hepatic encephalopathy. 
      L-Ornithine L-Aspartate facilitates the conversion of ammonia to urea,
      which is then excreted.

## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for hepatic encephalopathy, a decline in brain function due to liver disease and the resulting inability to remove toxins from the body.  It also aids in the treatment of indigestion (dyspepsia) and inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis).  Additionally, it is sometimes used for fatty liver disease.
- **Pharmacological Classification**:  Hepatoprotective (liver-protecting) and digestive enzyme.

## **Alternate Names** 

- L-Ornithine-L-Aspartate / Pancreatin
- LOLA (for L-Ornithine-L-Aspartate)
- **Brand Names**: Orniliv, Hepasar, QUIKLOR (and others, which can vary regionally).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**:  L-Ornithine L-Aspartate works by reducing ammonia levels in the blood. Ammonia is a toxic byproduct of protein metabolism, and its accumulation can negatively impact brain function. L-Ornithine L-Aspartate stimulates the urea cycle, converting ammonia to urea, which is then excreted by the kidneys. L-Aspartate also contributes to energy production in liver cells and supports liver regeneration. Pancreatin helps to digest fats, proteins, and carbohydrates by supplying the enzymes lipase, protease, and amylase, which are normally produced by the pancreas.
- **Pharmacokinetics**:  L-Ornithine L-Aspartate is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and metabolized in the liver. It's primarily eliminated via renal excretion. Pancreatin enzymes work locally in the digestive tract and are not absorbed systemically. They're eventually broken down and eliminated.
- **Mode of action**: L-Ornithine L-Aspartate facilitates ammonia detoxification through the urea cycle, reducing its toxic effects.  Pancreatin's enzymes act directly on ingested food components, facilitating digestion and absorption.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**  
#### **Adults:**  
- Typical dosage is 1-2 tablets, three times daily, taken orally with or after meals.  Dosages may vary depending on the specific formulation and the patient's condition.

#### **Children:**  
- Safety and efficacy in children under 12 years old haven't been fully established.  Use with caution and under strict medical supervision. Consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosing guidelines based on the child's age and weight.



#### **Special Cases:**  
- **Elderly Patients** – Start with a lower dose and monitor closely for adverse effects. Dose adjustments may be necessary based on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment** – Dose reductions are usually necessary.  Careful monitoring of kidney function is essential.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction** – While used to treat hepatic encephalopathy, close monitoring is crucial, and dosage adjustments should be individualized.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions** –  Patients with diabetes should use with caution, as pancreatin may affect blood glucose levels.  Closely monitor blood glucose levels.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  
The available sources do not provide specific dosage recommendations for clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Dosage adjustments in these cases should be determined on a case-by-case basis and under direct supervision of a medical professional.



### **Dosage Adjustments**  
Adjustments may be needed based on patient-specific factors, including renal/hepatic dysfunction and other medical conditions.
