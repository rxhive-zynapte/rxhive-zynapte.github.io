## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for dry skin conditions such as xerosis, ichthyosis, and cracked heels. It is also used to manage rough, scaly, or itchy skin and minor skin irritations.  It may be used for certain skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis, and ichthyosis vulgaris, but with caution, as it might exacerbate irritation in some cases. This topical medication falls under the pharmacological classifications of emollients and keratolytics, specifically categorized as a skin hydration medication.  The mechanism of action involves the synergistic effects of its components to hydrate, exfoliate, and protect the skin.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination doesn't have a standardized International Nonproprietary Name (INN). It is often referred to by the names of its constituents.  Some brand names under which this combination is marketed include HumaTant Cream, Moisturex Cream, Urelact Cream, Eurosoft Crack Heal, Moistril Cream, Keratovin Cream, Foot Mark Cream, Emlosoft Foot Cream, and Amaize Cream.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  The combined action of the ingredients addresses dry skin conditions through multiple mechanisms. Lactic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA), exfoliates by dissolving the bonds between dead skin cells, promoting skin cell renewal and smoother skin. Liquid paraffin forms a protective barrier on the skin, preventing moisture loss and maintaining hydration.  Propylene glycol, a humectant, draws moisture from the environment to the skin, keeping it hydrated and supple. Additionally, it enhances the penetration of other ingredients into the skin. Urea, a keratolytic agent, softens and hydrates the skin by breaking down keratin in dead skin cells, thus promoting exfoliation and hydration.

**Pharmacokinetics:** As a topical medication, systemic absorption is minimal. The ingredients primarily exert their effects locally on the skin.

**Mode of Action:**  Lactic acid acts on the stratum corneum by disrupting the cohesion of corneocytes, leading to exfoliation. Liquid paraffin forms a hydrophobic layer on the skin's surface, preventing transepidermal water loss. Propylene glycol increases skin hydration by drawing water into the stratum corneum. Urea increases the water-holding capacity of the stratum corneum and promotes desquamation of the skin.

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**  The combination does not exhibit any known direct interactions with cellular receptors, inhibit specific enzymes, or modulate neurotransmitter activity.  Its action is primarily focused on the physical and chemical properties of the skin layers.

**Elimination pathways:** Due to minimal systemic absorption, the elimination pathways for the topically applied medication are not clinically significant.  Any small amounts absorbed are likely metabolized and excreted via typical routes.

## **Dosage**
