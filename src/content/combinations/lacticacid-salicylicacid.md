## **Usage**

Lactic acid + salicylic acid is prescribed for various skin conditions, primarily for its keratolytic and exfoliating properties.  These conditions include:

*   Acne vulgaris
*   Warts (common, plantar, but not genital or hairy warts)
*   Corns and calluses
*   Dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis
*   Photodamaged skin (to reduce fine lines, wrinkles, and hyperpigmentation)
*   Keratosis pilaris
*   Ichthyosis

**Pharmacological Classification:** Keratolytic agent

**Mechanism of Action:** Salicylic acid, a beta-hydroxy acid (BHA), breaks down keratin by dissolving the intercellular "glue" holding skin cells together. This promotes exfoliation of the stratum corneum, unclogging pores and removing debris. Lactic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA), also promotes exfoliation and acts as a humectant, moisturizing the skin and counteracting salicylic acid's drying effects.  Both ingredients work synergistically to exfoliate the skin and improve its texture and appearance.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for this combination.  The names of specific products containing this combination may vary.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Lactic acid and salicylic acid cause exfoliation of the stratum corneum. Salicylic acid also has comedolytic (anti-blackhead and whitehead) and anti-inflammatory properties. Lactic acid has moisturizing properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:** These medications are applied topically.  Minimal systemic absorption occurs when applied to small, intact areas of skin as directed. Absorption may increase if applied to large areas, broken skin, or under occlusion.  Limited data exists on the metabolism and elimination of topical lactic acid and salicylic acid.

**Mode of Action:** Both agents disrupt desmosomal adhesion within the stratum corneum, leading to desquamation and shedding of the outer skin layers.  Salicylic acid may also inhibit lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase, reducing inflammation.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Dosage depends on the specific product formulation and the condition being treated.  Refer to product labeling for precise instructions.  Generally, the combination is applied once or twice daily to affected areas.

#### **Children:** Use in children under 2 years is generally not recommended without medical supervision.  For older children, follow product-specific guidelines. Start with the lowest concentration and monitor for irritation.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution, as they may have thinner skin and be more prone to irritation.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Minimal systemic absorption expected, so dosage adjustments are typically not needed.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Minimal systemic absorption expected, so dosage adjustments are typically not needed.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions (e.g. Diabetes):** Exercise caution in patients with diabetes or peripheral vascular disease, as impaired wound healing can be a risk.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication is not typically used in the listed clinical settings (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations).  Its use is confined to topical application for dermatological conditions.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments based on specific patient factors may be needed. Consult product labeling for details.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Skin irritation (redness, dryness, burning, stinging, itching, peeling, scaling)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Severe skin irritation
*   Allergic reaction (rare)
*   Salicylism (systemic toxicity from excessive absorption; rare with topical use)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Prolonged overuse can cause excessive dryness and skin thinning.

## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to lactic acid or salicylic acid
*   Open wounds or broken skin
*   Moles, birthmarks, hairy warts, genital warts
*   Diabetes or poor peripheral circulation (use with caution)

## **Drug Interactions**

*   Other topical acne medications (retinoids, benzoyl peroxide): May increase irritation. Use with caution or alternate application.
*   Oral salicylates (aspirin): May increase the risk of salicylism with extensive application.
*   Photosensitizing medications: May increase sun sensitivity.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Limited data is available regarding the safety of lactic acid and salicylic acid during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Topical application of low concentrations over small skin areas is considered low risk.  Avoid application to nipples or breasts if breastfeeding. Consult a doctor before using during pregnancy or while nursing.
