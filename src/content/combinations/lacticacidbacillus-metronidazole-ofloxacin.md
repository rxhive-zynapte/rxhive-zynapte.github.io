## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for various bacterial and parasitic infections, particularly those affecting the gastrointestinal tract. These include:

*   Diarrhea and dysentery caused by susceptible bacteria or parasites
*   Amoebiasis (infection with *Entamoeba histolytica*)
*   Giardiasis (infection with *Giardia lamblia*)
*   Bacterial vaginosis
*   Pelvic inflammatory disease
*  Gastroenteritis
*   Other mixed bacterial infections, where the Lactobacillus component aids in restoring gut flora disrupted by antibiotics

**Pharmacological Classification:**

*   Ofloxacin: Fluoroquinolone antibiotic
*   Metronidazole: Nitroimidazole antibiotic, antiprotozoal
*   Lactic acid bacillus: Probiotic

**Mechanism of Action:**

Ofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes crucial for DNA replication and cell division. Metronidazole disrupts DNA synthesis and damages cell membranes in anaerobic bacteria and protozoa. Lactic acid bacillus helps restore healthy gut flora.



## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination. However, the individual components have several synonyms.  Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer.  Some examples include "Norfagyl Plus," "OFLARGE M SUSP," and "Neoxy-MT."


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ofloxacin and metronidazole exhibit bactericidal and antiparasitic actions by disrupting DNA function and cell wall integrity.  Lactic acid bacillus exerts probiotic effects by competing with pathogenic organisms and potentially bolstering local immune function.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Ofloxacin is well-absorbed orally. Metronidazole absorption is also good.  Lactobacillus is ingested in spore form and colonizes the GI tract.
*   **Metabolism:**  Ofloxacin is minimally metabolized. Metronidazole undergoes some hepatic metabolism.
*   **Elimination:** Ofloxacin is primarily excreted renally. Metronidazole is excreted in urine and feces.

**Mode of Action:** Ofloxacin inhibits DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Metronidazole creates cytotoxic metabolites that damage bacterial/parasitic DNA.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Ofloxacin targets DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Metronidazole's metabolites disrupt DNA.  No known direct neurotransmitter effects.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for Ofloxacin; both renal and hepatic routes for metronidazole.



## **Dosage**

Dosage and duration are determined by the specific infection, severity, and patient factors. Always consult current clinical guidelines and individual patient considerations.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Specific dosing varies depending on the indication and formulation. Consult reliable resources like the product insert for accurate details.

#### **Children:**  Pediatric dosing must be carefully calculated based on weight and age, considering the potential for accumulation in neonates.  Not recommended for children under 18 for some formulations.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Exercise caution, particularly with high doses or renal impairment.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be required.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised; dose adjustments may be needed.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider underlying medical conditions like epilepsy, heart problems, or CNS disorders when prescribing.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations are condition specific.  Consult product information and guidelines for clinical use cases such as surgical prophylaxis.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Modifications are essential for renal/hepatic impairment, CNS disorders, and potential drug interactions. Always consider patient-specific factors.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, photosensitivity.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Peripheral neuropathy, seizures, tendon rupture, severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea. QT interval prolongation (rarely with metronidazole + ofloxacin combination).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Peripheral neuropathy can be a chronic complication.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome), hepatotoxicity, QT prolongation (rarely).



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to quinolones or nitroimidazoles, myasthenia gravis, tendon disorders, epilepsy, pregnancy (especially first trimester), breastfeeding (unless benefits outweigh risks), children and adolescents (some formulations).



## **Drug Interactions**

Antacids, calcium, magnesium, iron supplements, warfarin, theophylline, NSAIDs, some antidepressants, antiarrhythmics. Alcohol can induce a disulfiram-like reaction with metronidazole.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Generally contraindicated during pregnancy, especially the first trimester. Ofloxacin and metronidazole can be excreted in breast milk. Consult guidelines for managing potential neonatal risks if use is unavoidable.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

Refer to the information provided above for details on mechanism of action, side effects, contraindications, drug interactions, and dosage.

**Monitoring Parameters:**  Renal and liver function, complete blood count (CBC), ECG (especially if co-prescribing drugs that prolong the QT interval).  Monitor for signs of tendonitis or peripheral neuropathy.

## **Popular Combinations**

This combination itself is a common clinical combination. The inclusion of Lactobacillus is intended to mitigate antibiotic-associated diarrhea.


## **Precautions**

Screen for contraindications and drug interactions.  Avoid alcohol with metronidazole.  Advise patients about photosensitivity. Monitor for tendonitis and neuropathy. Use caution in elderly patients and those with renal or hepatic impairment. Avoid use in pregnancy and breastfeeding if possible.
