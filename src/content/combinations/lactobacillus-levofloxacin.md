## **Usage**

- This combination is prescribed for bacterial infections such as pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections, urinary tract infections, and skin infections. It is also used to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic; Lactobacillus is a probiotic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Levofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair. Lactobacillus helps restore the normal gut flora, which can be disrupted by antibiotic use.

## **Alternate Names**

- No internationally recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination.
- **Brand Names:**  Brand names vary regionally and include combinations such as NexO and others; Levofloxacin is sold under Levaquin, among others.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Levofloxacin exerts a bactericidal effect by interfering with bacterial DNA replication. Lactobacillus, a probiotic, helps maintain a healthy gut microbiome, counteracting the adverse effects of antibiotics on gut flora.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Levofloxacin is rapidly absorbed orally and achieves peak plasma concentrations within 1-2 hours.  It is metabolized to a small extent in the liver and primarily excreted by the kidneys. Lactobacillus colonizes the gut.
- **Mode of Action:**  Levofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. This inhibition disrupts DNA replication and repair in susceptible bacteria. No receptor binding or neurotransmitter modulation is associated with levofloxacin's action.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Levofloxacin is mainly eliminated renally, with a small fraction excreted in feces.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Levofloxacin: 250-750 mg orally or intravenously once daily, depending on the infection.
- Lactobacillus:  Dose varies with product; concomitant use usually continues several days beyond the antibiotic course.

#### **Children:**

- Levofloxacin: Generally avoided in children except for specific serious infections (e.g., anthrax, plague) due to concerns about musculoskeletal toxicity.  If used, dosing is weight-based (8-10 mg/kg twice daily for children 6 months to <5 years and 10mg/kg once daily for children â‰¥5 years, maximum 750 mg/day).
- Lactobacillus: Use probiotics cautiously in children due to potential sepsis risk. Consult current guidelines.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and monitor for adverse events.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment needed for levofloxacin based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Limited dose adjustment guidelines exist. Monitor carefully.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate potential interactions with other medications.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing is usually guided by the specific infection being treated (e.g., pneumonia, UTI, skin infection) and follows the standard adult dosing recommendations outlined above.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjust levofloxacin dosing based on renal function.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Nausea, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, vomiting.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Tendonitis, tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, *Clostridium difficile* - associated diarrhea,  QT prolongation, seizures, hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis).


### **Long-Term Effects**

- Peripheral neuropathy may persist even after discontinuation.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis.



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to levofloxacin or other quinolones.
- History of tendon disorders related to fluoroquinolone use.
- Myasthenia gravis.



## **Drug Interactions**

- Antacids,  calcium, iron, or zinc supplements, sucralfate can reduce levofloxacin absorption.
- NSAIDs can increase the risk of CNS effects like seizures.
- Warfarin: Levofloxacin can enhance the anticoagulant effect.
- Theophylline: Levofloxacin may increase theophylline levels.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Levofloxacin is generally avoided in pregnancy due to concerns about musculoskeletal toxicity in the developing fetus. If used, consider risks versus benefits.
- Levofloxacin is excreted in breast milk. The decision to breastfeed should be made considering the potential infant risk.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Levofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV; Lactobacillus restores gut flora.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, tendon rupture (rare), *C. difficile* infection.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, tendon disorders related to quinolones, myasthenia gravis.
- **Drug Interactions:** Antacids, multivitamins, NSAIDs, warfarin.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally avoided in pregnancy; use with caution during lactation.
- **Dosage:** Levofloxacin 250-750 mg once daily; Lactobacillus dose varies by product.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, signs of tendonitis,  QT interval, signs of superinfection.


## **Popular Combinations**

Levofloxacin is sometimes combined with other antibiotics for specific infections. Combining levofloxacin with lactobacillus is primarily done to mitigate the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.



## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess renal function, monitor for tendon pain, avoid excessive sun exposure.
- **Specific Populations:** Avoid in pregnancy if possible; use cautiously during lactation.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid driving if dizziness occurs.
