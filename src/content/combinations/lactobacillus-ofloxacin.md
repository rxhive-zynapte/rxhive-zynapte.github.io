## Usage
- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for bacterial infections, especially those of the gastrointestinal tract, such as infectious diarrhea (including traveler's diarrhea) and dysentery.  The *Lactobacillus* component is included to help prevent or mitigate antibiotic-associated diarrhea, a common side effect of *Ofloxacin*.  It is also sometimes used in combination with other antibiotics, for enhanced effectiveness against certain bacteria.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic/Probiotic combination.
- **Mechanism of Action:** *Ofloxacin*, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. These enzymes are crucial for bacterial DNA replication and repair, thus disrupting bacterial growth and leading to cell death. *Lactobacillus*, a probiotic, helps restore the normal gut flora, which may be disrupted by antibiotic use.

## Alternate Names
- Ofloxacin + Lactobacillus
- Ofloxacin and Lactobacillus combination
- Ofloxacin/Lactobacillus
- **Brand Names:** Several brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and specific formulation, some include "Oflarge OZ+" and "Oford LB".


## How It Works
- **Pharmacodynamics:** *Ofloxacin* exerts its bactericidal effect by inhibiting DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, leading to impaired DNA replication and ultimately cell death.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** *Ofloxacin* is well-absorbed orally and widely distributed in the body. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily through the kidneys.  The *Lactobacillus* component primarily resides in the gut.
- **Mode of Action:**  *Ofloxacin* targets bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, inhibiting DNA replication.  Lactobacillus, competes with harmful bacteria for resources.
- **Elimination Pathways:** *Ofloxacin* is primarily eliminated via renal excretion, with some hepatic metabolism.

## Dosage

### Standard Dosage

#### Adults:
- A common dosage is one tablet containing 200 mg of *Ofloxacin* and 60 million spores (or CFU) of *Lactobacillus*, taken twice daily. This can be administered with or without food.  Treatment duration typically ranges from 5 to 10 days but varies with infection severity.

#### Children:
- This combination is generally not recommended for children under 12 years of age unless specifically prescribed by a doctor. Dosing is adjusted based on the child's age and weight.

#### Special Cases:
- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be needed due to age-related decline in renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose reduction is necessary if creatinine clearance is less than 50 mL/min.  Contraindicated if creatinine clearance is less than 30 mL/min.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution should be exercised, and liver function tests should be monitored.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration is needed for underlying conditions.


### Clinical Use Cases
The primary clinical use case is infectious diarrhea, but it might be used in other infections where *Ofloxacin* is indicated, with *Lactobacillus* to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Specific dosing for clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations should be decided on a case-by-case basis under direct supervision of a qualified medical professional.

### Dosage Adjustments
Dosage adjustments may be required for renal or hepatic impairment.

- Anticoagulants may have enhanced effects when used with *Ofloxacin*.
- Some antibiotics may reduce the efficacy of *Lactobacillus*.
- Drugs metabolized by certain liver enzymes (CYP450) can interact with *Ofloxacin*.

## Pregnancy and Breastfeeding
- *Ofloxacin* is generally avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential risks to the fetus or infant.
- The safety of Lactobacillus during pregnancy and breastfeeding isn't fully established, though generally considered safe in food.

## Drug Profile Summary
