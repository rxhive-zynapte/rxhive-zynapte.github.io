## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the treatment of acute diarrhea, particularly in children.  It is also used to reduce the duration and severity of rotavirus diarrhea, manage antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and prevent traveler's diarrhea.  Other potential uses include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) and *H. pylori* infection-related diarrhea.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antidiarrheal, Probiotic, Antisecretory.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination works through a multi-pronged approach. Racecadotril acts as an antisecretory agent by inhibiting enkephalinase, an enzyme responsible for breaking down enkephalins. This leads to increased enkephalin levels, which decrease the secretion of water and electrolytes into the intestines, thus reducing stool volume and frequency.  Lactobacillus and Saccharomyces boulardii are probiotics that help restore the balance of beneficial gut bacteria, which can be disrupted by infections or antibiotic use.  Saccharomyces boulardii, a yeast probiotic, additionally inhibits the growth of harmful bacteria and their toxins while supporting the intestinal immune system.

## **Alternate Names**

While there isn't a universally recognized alternate name for this specific combination, it's important to be aware of regional variations and brand names.  The individual components are sometimes referred to as:
* **Lactobacillus:** Lactic acid bacillus.
* **Saccharomyces boulardii:**  S. boulardii, Yeast probiotic.
* **Racecadotril:** Acetorphan (INN).

**Brand Names:** Some examples of brand names for this combination include DD Norm, Reflora-R, Bactospore-S, Orobact R, Racelon Pro, and Enuff Extra. Note that brand names can vary by region.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Racecadotril reduces intestinal fluid secretion without affecting bowel transit time. The probiotics, Lactobacillus and *Saccharomyces boulardii*, work by restoring the natural gut flora and inhibiting the growth of pathogenic bacteria.  *S. boulardii* also produces proteases that degrade bacterial toxins, strengthens the intestinal immune response, and promotes production of beneficial short-chain fatty acids.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Racecadotril is rapidly absorbed after oral administration.  It is metabolized to the active metabolite thiorphan, which is primarily eliminated through renal excretion. Information on the specific pharmacokinetics of the combined formulation with probiotics is limited. Probiotics generally exert their effects locally in the gut and are not systemically absorbed in significant amounts.
- **Mode of Action:** Racecadotril inhibits enkephalinase in the intestinal mucosa.  Lactobacillus and *Saccharomyces boulardii* compete with pathogenic bacteria for nutrients and adhesion sites in the gut.  *S. boulardii* exerts anti-inflammatory effects, enhances gut barrier function, and produces polyamines that support intestinal cell growth and repair.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Racecadotril is a selective inhibitor of enkephalinase. The probiotics do not have specific receptor binding or enzyme inhibition properties relevant to their antidiarrheal effect.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Racecadotril's active metabolite, thiorphan, is primarily excreted in the urine.  Probiotics are eliminated through the feces.
