## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Lamivudine + Nevirapine + Stavudine is prescribed for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and children.  This fixed-dose combination is particularly relevant in resource-limited settings.  It is not a cure for HIV/AIDS, but helps manage the infection by suppressing viral replication.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination product containing three antiretroviral drugs:
    - Lamivudine and Stavudine: Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs)
    - Nevirapine: Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI)
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Lamivudine and Stavudine are nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) that, after intracellular phosphorylation to their active triphosphate metabolites,  inhibit the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme by competing with natural substrates and causing DNA chain termination.  Nevirapine is an NNRTI that binds directly to reverse transcriptase, inhibiting both RNA- and DNA-dependent polymerase activity, thus blocking HIV replication.

## **Alternate Names**

- This combination is often referred to as 3TC/NVP/d4T, representing the abbreviations of its components.
- Brand names include Triomune (and its pediatric formulation, Triomune Junior). Availability may vary regionally.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The combination exerts synergistic antiretroviral activity by targeting HIV reverse transcriptase through two distinct mechanisms (NRTI and NNRTI). This inhibits viral replication, reducing viral load and increasing CD4 cell counts.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - *Absorption:* All three components are well-absorbed orally.  Food does not significantly affect the absorption of Lamivudine/Nevirapine/Stavudine tablets.
    - *Metabolism:* Lamivudine is primarily excreted unchanged renally. Stavudine is minimally metabolized.  Nevirapine is extensively metabolized by the liver via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, primarily CYP3A4 and CYP2B6.
    - *Elimination:*  Lamivudine and stavudine are eliminated renally.  Nevirapine's metabolites are excreted in urine and feces.

- **Mode of Action:** Lamivudine and stavudine compete with natural substrates to inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase and terminate viral DNA chain synthesis. Nevirapine binds directly to a different site on reverse transcriptase, allosterically inhibiting enzyme function and causing a conformational change.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- One tablet containing 150 mg lamivudine, 30 mg/40 mg stavudine, and 200 mg nevirapine twice daily. For the initial 14 days of nevirapine therapy, nevirapine should be administered as a lead-in dose of 200 mg once daily to reduce the risk of rash.

#### **Children:**
- Triomune Junior, containing lower doses of each component, is available for children. The dose is determined by the weight band.
- Pediatric dosing is based on a complex formula and requires individualized adjustment. Specific preparations of lamivudine, nevirapine, and stavudine should be used if dose adjustment is needed in children under 12 years of age or in those with kidney problems.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are needed for mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is required for lamivudine and stavudine.  The combination tablet is not recommended for creatinine clearance <50 mL/min. Individual components should be dosed separately.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** This combination is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution should be exercised in patients with liver disease (including hepatitis B or C), pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy, or bone marrow suppression.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  
This drug combination is specific for HIV-1 infection and is not used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations outside of HIV management.

### **Dosage Adjustments**  
Dose adjustments are necessary for renal impairment and hepatic dysfunction.  Due to the fixed-dose nature, separate components should be administered in these cases.  

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, insomnia, peripheral neuropathy (tingling and numbness), rash, fever.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Lactic acidosis, severe hepatotoxicity (including liver failure), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, pancreatitis, bone marrow suppression, lipodystrophy.

### **Long-Term Effects:**
Peripheral neuropathy, lipodystrophy, metabolic abnormalities, increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
Severe rash, hepatotoxicity, lactic acidosis, pancreatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any component of the drug.
- Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).
- History of severe rash or hepatic reactions to nevirapine.
- Abnormally low neutrophil or hemoglobin levels.
- Concomitant use of rifampicin or St. John's wort.

## **Drug Interactions**

- St. John's wort: Reduces nevirapine levels.
- Rifampicin: Reduces nevirapine levels.
- Other antiretrovirals: Potential for additive or synergistic effects and/or overlapping toxicities.
- Medications metabolized by CYP3A4: Nevirapine may affect their metabolism.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

-  While not absolutely contraindicated, the safety of this combination during pregnancy has not been fully established.  Data is limited.  Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.  
- All three drugs are present in breast milk. Women with HIV should not breastfeed due to the risk of transmitting the virus.  If prescribed during breastfeeding, stopping breastfeeding is advised.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  NRTIs (lamivudine and stavudine) inhibit reverse transcriptase by DNA chain termination; NNRTI (nevirapine) binds directly to reverse transcriptase.
- **Side Effects:** Rash, peripheral neuropathy, hepatotoxicity, lactic acidosis, pancreatitis, nausea, fatigue.
- **Contraindications:** Severe hepatic impairment, hypersensitivity, low neutrophil/hemoglobin, concomitant rifampicin or St. John's wort use.
- **Drug Interactions:** St. John's wort, rifampicin, other antiretrovirals.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution in pregnancy; contraindicated during breastfeeding due to the risk of HIV transmission.
- **Dosage:** Adults: one tablet twice daily after an initial nevirapine lead-in period. Children: Dose adjusted based on a weight band formula and given as Triomune Junior.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** CD4 cell count, viral load, liver function tests, complete blood counts, renal function.
