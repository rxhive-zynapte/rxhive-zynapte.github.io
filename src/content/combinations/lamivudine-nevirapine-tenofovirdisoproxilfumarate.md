  - q: >-
      Can HIV still be transmitted while taking this medication?**


      **A:** Although the medication significantly suppresses the viral load,
      there's still a possibility of transmission, particularly if the viral
      load isn't fully suppressed. Safe sex practices are always recommended.

## **Usage**

- This fixed-dose combination medication is prescribed for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and adolescents.  It's crucial that the patient is virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) and currently on a stable antiretroviral therapy regimen with no history of treatment failure. Also, no known resistance should exist to any of the drug's individual components.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antiretroviral, specifically a combination of two Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs) - Lamivudine and Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate - and one Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI) - Nevirapine.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Lamivudine and Tenofovir interfere with the virus's ability to replicate its genetic material by inhibiting reverse transcriptase, a viral enzyme. Nevirapine also targets reverse transcriptase, but at a different binding site, further hampering viral replication. This combination approach helps suppress the viral load and strengthens the immune system.

## **Alternate Names**

- There is no internationally recognized non-proprietary name for this specific three-drug combination. However, the individual components are frequently found in various fixed-dose combinations.
- **Brand Names:** There are no brand names explicitly listed for this exact three-drug combination, although the individual drugs are marketed under several brand names.



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The combination exerts synergistic antiviral effects by inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, preventing the conversion of viral RNA into DNA. This hinders viral replication and reduces the viral load, leading to improved immune function.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - **Absorption:** Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is a prodrug that gets converted to the active form, tenofovir diphosphate, inside cells. Lamivudine and Nevirapine are readily absorbed after oral administration.
    - **Metabolism:** Lamivudine and Nevirapine are primarily metabolized in the liver via various pathways. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is metabolized to tenofovir, and undergoes further intracellular phosphorylation to the active diphosphate form.
    - **Elimination:**  Lamivudine and Tenofovir are primarily eliminated through renal excretion. Nevirapine is extensively metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine, mostly as metabolites.
- **Mode of Action:** These drugs act as competitive inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, disrupting the formation of proviral DNA.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** The drugs target viral reverse transcriptase. There is no known significant interaction with human receptors or neurotransmitters.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for Lamivudine and Tenofovir, and hepatic metabolism followed by renal excretion for Nevirapine.
