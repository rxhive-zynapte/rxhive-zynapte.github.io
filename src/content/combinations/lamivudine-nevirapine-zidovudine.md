## **Usage**

This combination of drugs is prescribed for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.  It's classified as an antiretroviral agent, specifically a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) (zidovudine and lamivudine) combined with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) (nevirapine).  These drugs work together to inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, essential for HIV replication, preventing the virus from multiplying and spreading within the body.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination doesn't have a specific generic name as it's a combination of three different drugs. However, each of the drugs is known by their generic and various brand names. Zidovudine is also known as AZT or ZDV.  Brand names include Retrovir. Lamivudine is also known as 3TC. Epivir is one brand name for lamivudine.  Nevirapine is also known as NVP. Viramune is one brand name for nevirapine. Several brand names may exist for the individual components as well as for the combination.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Lamivudine and zidovudine are nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) that, after intracellular phosphorylation to their active triphosphate form, inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase by competing with the natural substrate, deoxycytidine triphosphate. Incorporation of the lamivudine and zidovudine triphosphates into the viral DNA chain causes chain termination. Nevirapine is a non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) that binds directly to reverse transcriptase and blocks RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities by causing a disruption of the enzyme's catalytic site.  The combination acts synergistically to suppress HIV replication.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** All three drugs are absorbed orally.
* **Metabolism:**  Lamivudine is minimally metabolized. Zidovudine is primarily metabolized in the liver to the inactive glucuronide form. Nevirapine is extensively metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, specifically CYP3A4 and CYP2B6.
* **Elimination:** Lamivudine is primarily excreted renally. Zidovudine metabolites are also eliminated renally. Nevirapine metabolites are excreted in urine and feces.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Lamivudine:** 300 mg orally once daily or 150 mg twice daily.
* **Nevirapine:** 200 mg daily for 14 days, then 200 mg twice daily.
* **Zidovudine:** 300 mg orally twice daily or 200 mg three times a day, or 600 mg daily as extended release tablets. It can also be administered intravenously as 1 mg/kg every 4 hours (six times daily).

#### **Children:**

Dosing in children is weight-based and should be determined by a doctor, as it varies based on age, weight, and clinical presentation.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be needed based on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be needed for lamivudine and zidovudine based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised with nevirapine in patients with hepatic impairment. Dose adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments should be considered case by case, based on individual patient characteristics.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is specifically for HIV-1 infection. The dosage does not change specifically for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. The standard dosage considerations and adjustments apply.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on renal and hepatic function, potential drug interactions, and comorbid conditions.
