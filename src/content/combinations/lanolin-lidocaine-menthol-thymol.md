## **Usage**

This topical medication is prescribed for symptomatic relief of anorectal discomfort associated with hemorrhoids (piles), anal fissures, and anal fistulas.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Local anesthetic (Lidocaine), counterirritant/topical analgesic (Menthol, Thymol), skin protectant/emollient (Lanolin), and antiseptic (Thymol).

- **Mechanism of Action:** Lidocaine blocks nerve signals, reducing pain sensation. Menthol and Thymol act as counterirritants, producing a cooling sensation.  Lanolin provides a protective barrier and moisturizes the skin. Thymol also has antiseptic properties.

## **Alternate Names**

- Lanolin/Lidocaine/Menthol/Thymol combination
- Hadensa Ointment (Brand name)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Lidocaine stabilizes neuronal membranes, inhibiting nerve impulse initiation and conduction, producing local anesthesia. Menthol and Thymol stimulate cold receptors, creating a cooling sensation and reducing pain/itch perception. Lanolin creates a physical barrier, moisturizing and protecting the skin. Thymol exhibits antiseptic activity.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Limited systemic absorption occurs with topical application. Absorbed Lidocaine is metabolized in the liver and excreted renally. Menthol and Thymol are primarily metabolized in the liver.  Lanolin is minimally absorbed.

- **Mode of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Lidocaine blocks voltage-gated sodium channels in neuronal membranes, preventing action potential propagation. Menthol and Thymol activate TRPM8 receptors (transient receptor potential melastatin 8), which are cold and menthol-sensitive ion channels. This activation leads to the sensation of cooling. Lanolin does not have a specific receptor binding or enzyme inhibition mechanism. It acts as an emollient, softening and moisturizing the skin. Thymol, in addition to TRPM8 activation, exerts its antiseptic effect by disrupting bacterial cell membranes.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism for all ingredients except Lidocaine, which undergoes hepatic metabolism followed by renal excretion.
