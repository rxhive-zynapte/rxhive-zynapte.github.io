## **Usage**

- Levo-carnitine + Vitamin E is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to support energy production, enhance fat metabolism, and promote overall well-being. It may also be used to address carnitine deficiency.  It is being investigated for use in patients on dialysis as part of a study.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Nutritional supplement, metabolic agent, antioxidant.
- **Mechanism of action:** Levo-carnitine facilitates the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation and energy production. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from oxidative stress.

## **Alternate Names**

- L-carnitine + Vitamin E
-  Levocarnitine and Vitamin E combination

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Levo-carnitine enhances fatty acid oxidation, improving energy production. Vitamin E scavenges free radicals, protecting cell membranes and other structures from oxidative damage.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Levo-carnitine is absorbed in the small intestine and distributed throughout the body. It is primarily eliminated renally.  Vitamin E is absorbed with dietary fats and distributed to tissues. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted in bile.
- **Mode of action:** Levo-carnitine acts as a carrier molecule, transporting fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane. Vitamin E donates electrons to neutralize free radicals, preventing lipid peroxidation.
- **Elimination pathways:** Levo-carnitine: Renal excretion. Vitamin E: Hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Oral: One capsule containing 100 mg levocarnitine and 200 mg vitamin E, once daily, or as directed by a healthcare professional. Other sources suggest  990 mg of levocarnitine two or three times a day.
- One study on dialysis patients used 500 mg levocarnitine daily.


#### **Children:**

- The dosage for children needs to be determined by a doctor based on the child's weight and the specific condition being treated.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be needed based on kidney function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction might be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advised; dosage adjustments may be needed.
