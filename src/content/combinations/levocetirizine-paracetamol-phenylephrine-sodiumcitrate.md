## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of the common cold, flu, and allergic rhinitis (hay fever).  It addresses symptoms such as nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, watery eyes, headache, body aches, and fever.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This combination includes:

* **Levocetirizine:** Antihistamine (second-generation)
* **Paracetamol:** Analgesic and antipyretic
* **Phenylephrine:** Decongestant (sympathomimetic amine)
* **Sodium Citrate:** Alkalinizing agent

**Mechanism of Action:**  The components work synergistically to alleviate symptoms:

* **Levocetirizine:** Blocks peripheral H1 receptors, reducing histamine-mediated allergic reactions.
* **Paracetamol:** Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis in the central nervous system, mitigating pain and fever.
* **Phenylephrine:** Constricts blood vessels in the nasal mucosa, relieving nasal congestion.
* **Sodium Citrate:** Alkalinizes urine, potentially easing dysuria associated with colds and flu.


## **Alternate Names**

There is no officially recognized international non-proprietary name (INN) for this specific combination.  It's sometimes referred to as Levocetirizine/Paracetamol/Phenylephrine/Sodium Citrate combination. Brand names vary regionally (e.g. Fluseal).

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Levocetirizine:** Reduces vascular permeability, itching, and capillary dilation associated with allergic reactions.
* **Paracetamol:** Exerts analgesic and antipyretic effects through central prostaglandin inhibition.  It has minimal anti-inflammatory action.
* **Phenylephrine:** Stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa, reducing congestion.
* **Sodium Citrate:**  Increases urine pH, providing relief from some urinary symptoms.


**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Levocetirizine:**  Rapidly absorbed after oral administration, peak plasma concentration in approximately 0.9 hours. Primarily excreted renally.
* **Paracetamol:** Well absorbed orally, peak plasma levels within 30-60 minutes. Metabolized in the liver, excreted renally.
* **Phenylephrine:**  Absorption can vary. Metabolized by monoamine oxidase in the gastrointestinal tract and liver.
* **Sodium Citrate:**  Absorbed and metabolized, primarily excreted renally.


**Mode of Action (Cellular/Molecular):**

* **Levocetirizine:** Competitive antagonist of the H1 histamine receptor.
* **Paracetamol:** Exact mechanism not fully elucidated, but it is believed to inhibit COX enzymes, primarily in the CNS.
* **Phenylephrine:** Agonist at alpha-adrenergic receptors.


**Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily renal excretion for levocetirizine, paracetamol, and sodium citrate. Phenylephrine is metabolized by monoamine oxidase.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** One tablet every 12 hours as needed. Typical strength per tablet: Levocetirizine 2.5mg, Paracetamol 500mg, Phenylephrine 10mg.

#### **Children (6-12 years):** Half a tablet every 12 hours as needed, using the same per-tablet strength as for adults.  Not generally recommended for children under 6.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Start with a lower dose and monitor for adverse effects due to potential age-related decline in renal and/or hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction or increased dosing interval may be required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dose reduction is usually recommended. Avoid in severe liver disease.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, glaucoma, or those taking MAO inhibitors.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.  Its use is primarily for outpatient management of common cold and allergy symptoms.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments should be made based on individual patient factors such as renal or hepatic dysfunction, age, and concomitant medications.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Drowsiness, dry mouth, headache, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, constipation, restlessness.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), difficulty breathing, hallucinations,  hepatotoxicity (with paracetamol overdose), cardiac arrhythmias, increased blood pressure.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic complications are unlikely with short-term use as indicated.  Long-term paracetamol use can contribute to liver damage, especially at high doses or with pre-existing liver conditions.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, hepatotoxicity, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any component, severe liver or kidney disease, severe hypertension or coronary artery disease, concomitant use of MAO inhibitors. Angle-closure glaucoma.


## **Drug Interactions**

MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers, other decongestants or antihistamines, alcohol, CNS depressants (e.g. benzodiazepines).  May interact with warfarin, aspirin, chloramphenicol, cholestyramine, domperidone, metoclopramide, anti-allergic drugs like diphenhydramine, drugs reducing stomach acid (e.g., pantoprazole).



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use with caution during pregnancy only if clearly needed.  Levocetirizine is excreted in breast milk. Paracetamol is generally considered compatible with breastfeeding.  Phenylephrine's presence in breast milk is uncertain. Consult with a physician to assess risk/benefit.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** See “How It Works” section.
* **Side Effects:**  Drowsiness, dry mouth, headache, nausea, dizziness.  Rarely: allergic reactions, hepatotoxicity.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe liver/kidney disease, severe hypertension, MAOI use.
* **Drug Interactions:** MAOIs, tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers, alcohol, other decongestants/antihistamines.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution in pregnancy.  Excreted in breast milk.
* **Dosage:** Adults: One tablet every 12 hours as needed.  Children (6-12): Half tablet every 12 hours.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, liver function tests (with prolonged use).



## **Popular Combinations**

This combination itself is a popular formulation for addressing multiple cold and allergy symptoms.  Sometimes caffeine is added for its stimulant properties.


## **Precautions**

Screen for allergies, metabolic disorders, and organ dysfunction.  Caution in pregnancy/breastfeeding, children, and elderly. Avoid alcohol, monitor blood pressure.  Driving restrictions may apply due to drowsiness.
