## **Usage**

- Levocetirizine + Phenylephrine is prescribed for the relief of symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and the common cold, such as sneezing, runny nose, watery eyes, itching, and nasal congestion.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antihistamine (Levocetirizine) + Decongestant (Phenylephrine).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Levocetirizine is a selective H1-receptor antagonist that blocks the effects of histamine, a chemical mediator involved in allergic reactions. Phenylephrine is an alpha-adrenergic agonist that constricts blood vessels in the nasal mucosa, reducing swelling and congestion.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this combination.
- **Brand Names:** This combination is marketed under various brand names like LevoCet-P,  Respira-D, Histafree-P and others, but they may not be widely available internationally.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Levocetirizine competitively binds to peripheral H1 receptors, inhibiting histamine-mediated responses such as vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and mucus secretion. Phenylephrine activates alpha-adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle, causing vasoconstriction and reducing nasal congestion.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Levocetirizine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in about 0.9 hours. It is minimally metabolized and primarily excreted unchanged in urine. Phenylephrine is also absorbed orally but undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism, resulting in lower bioavailability. It is metabolized by monoamine oxidase and primarily excreted in urine.
- **Mode of Action:**  Levocetirizine exerts its antihistaminic effects by blocking H1 receptors and subsequently inhibiting the downstream signaling pathways responsible for allergic symptoms. Phenylephrine causes vasoconstriction by stimulating alpha1-adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle, thus decreasing nasal blood flow and congestion.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Levocetirizine is primarily eliminated through renal excretion, while phenylephrine is eliminated through both renal and hepatic pathways.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Typically, one tablet containing 5 mg levocetirizine and 10 mg phenylephrine is taken once daily, preferably in the evening.

#### **Children:**

- This combination is generally not recommended for children under 12 years of age. For children aged 12 years and above the adult dose can be used but with caution, especially in children with renal or hepatic impairment.  

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Start with a lower dose and monitor closely for adverse effects. Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is usually recommended, depending on the severity of the impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advised, and dose adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** For patients with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or hyperthyroidism, dosage adjustments and careful monitoring may be required.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- The specific use of Levocetirizine + Phenylephrine in the mentioned clinical settings (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations) is not typically indicated, and dosage recommendations for these settings are not established. These situations might warrant different medications for managing specific symptoms or conditions.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments should be made based on individual patient characteristics, including renal function, hepatic function, age, and the presence of other medical conditions.  



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Headache
- Dry mouth
- Drowsiness
- Fatigue
- Nausea

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (e.g., skin rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
- Cardiovascular effects (e.g., palpitations, increased heart rate, hypertension)
- Neurological effects (e.g., dizziness, seizures)

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Long-term effects are generally not expected with appropriate use, but chronic use of decongestants can lead to rebound congestion (rhinitis medicamentosa).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to levocetirizine, phenylephrine, or any component of the formulation.
- Severe renal impairment (end-stage renal disease).
- Severe hypertension or coronary artery disease.
- Concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).
- Narrow-angle glaucoma.

## **Drug Interactions**

- MAOIs (e.g., selegiline, phenelzine):  Concomitant use is contraindicated as it can lead to severe hypertensive crisis.
- Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and other drugs that increase blood pressure can potentiate the pressor effects of phenylephrine.
- Alcohol can enhance the sedative effects of levocetirizine.
- Other CNS depressants (e.g., sedatives, hypnotics) can potentiate drowsiness.
- Beta-blockers can interact with phenylephrine, potentially causing hypertension and bradycardia.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed, after weighing the benefits to the mother against potential risks to the fetus.
- **Breastfeeding:** Levocetirizine is excreted in breast milk. The amount of phenylephrine excreted in breast milk is unknown. Use with caution during breastfeeding, or consider alternatives.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Levocetirizine: H1-receptor antagonist; Phenylephrine: Alpha-adrenergic agonist.
- **Side Effects:** Headache, dry mouth, drowsiness, fatigue, nausea.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe renal impairment, severe hypertension, MAOI use, narrow-angle glaucoma.
- **Drug Interactions:** MAOIs, TCAs, alcohol, CNS depressants, beta-blockers.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution.
- **Dosage:** Adults:  5 mg levocetirizine + 10 mg phenylephrine once daily. Not generally recommended for children under 12.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Blood pressure, heart rate, renal function tests (especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment).


## **Popular Combinations**

- Levocetirizine + Phenylephrine is often combined with paracetamol (acetaminophen) to provide additional relief from fever and pain associated with cold and flu.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Evaluate renal and hepatic function, especially in elderly patients and those with pre-existing conditions.
- **Specific Populations:**  Use with caution in pregnant and breastfeeding women, elderly patients, and children.
