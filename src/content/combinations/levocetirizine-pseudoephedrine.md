## **Usage**

Levocetirizine + Pseudoephedrine is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and the common cold.  It effectively addresses symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, itchy or watery eyes, and sinus pressure.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** This combination drug falls under two classifications:
    - Levocetirizine: Antihistamine (specifically, a second-generation non-sedating antihistamine).
    - Pseudoephedrine: Decongestant (specifically, a sympathomimetic amine).

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Levocetirizine competes with histamine for binding to H1-receptor sites, thus reducing the effects of histamine, a chemical mediator responsible for allergic symptoms. Pseudoephedrine acts as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, constricting blood vessels in the nasal mucosa, which reduces nasal congestion.


## **Alternate Names**

While "Levocetirizine + Pseudoephedrine" is the standard generic name, some regional variations may exist.  Several brand names are available depending on the manufacturer and country.  A few examples of brand names containing this drug combination include Xyzal Allergy 24HR.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Levocetirizine antagonizes the effects of histamine at peripheral H1 receptors, reducing vascular permeability and the formation of edema, thereby alleviating allergic symptoms. Pseudoephedrine, through its alpha-adrenergic agonist activity, constricts dilated blood vessels in the nasal mucosa, reducing nasal congestion.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Both drugs are well-absorbed after oral administration.
    - **Metabolism:** Levocetirizine undergoes minimal metabolism. Pseudoephedrine is partially metabolized in the liver.
    - **Elimination:** Levocetirizine is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.  Pseudoephedrine is excreted primarily in the urine, both unchanged and as metabolites.


- **Mode of Action (Cellular/Molecular):** Levocetirizine selectively binds to peripheral H1 receptors without significant anticholinergic or serotonergic activity. Pseudoephedrine stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors in the nasal vasculature, leading to vasoconstriction.

- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Levocetirizine acts as a competitive antagonist at the H1 receptor. Pseudoephedrine indirectly affects neurotransmitter release by influencing presynaptic adrenergic receptors.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults and Children 12 years and older:**

- One tablet (typically containing 5mg levocetirizine and 120mg pseudoephedrine) every 12 hours.
- Maximum dose: Two tablets per 24 hours.

#### **Children:**

- **Children under 12 years:** Not recommended due to the pseudoephedrine component.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution; dose adjustments may be necessary based on kidney function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment is crucial, depending on creatinine clearance (CrCl). (See Dosage Modifications section for more details).
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dose adjustment may be necessary based on the severity of liver disease.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution should be exercised in patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, elevated intraocular pressure, prostatic hypertrophy, cardiovascular disease, or other relevant conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The primary clinical use case for this combination is the relief of symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis and the common cold.  It is not typically indicated for use in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

As of 2025-02-16, for adults:
CrCl 50-80 mL/min: 2.5 mg PO qDay
CrCl 30-50 mL/min: 2.5 mg PO every other day
CrCl 10-30 mL/min: 2.5 mg PO 2x/wk (i.e., q3-4 days)
CrCl <10 mL/min and/or hemodialysis: Contraindicated


Children 6 months to <12 years with any degree of renal impairment: Contraindicated.
