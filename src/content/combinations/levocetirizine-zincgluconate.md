## **Usage**

Levocetirizine + Zinc Gluconate is prescribed for the relief of symptoms associated with allergies like allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and urticaria (hives), and the common cold.  It may also be used to treat zinc deficiency.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Antihistamine (Levocetirizine), Mineral Supplement (Zinc Gluconate). It can also be classified as an anti-allergy and cold remedy medication.

**Mechanism of Action:** Levocetirizine is a second-generation, non-sedating antihistamine that selectively blocks peripheral H1 receptors, reducing the effects of histamine released during allergic reactions. Zinc gluconate's role in cold symptom relief isn't fully understood but is thought to involve immune modulation and possibly reducing inflammation.

## **Alternate Names**

Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride + Zinc Gluconate; Levocetirizine and Zinc combination.  There are numerous brand names under which this combination is marketed (Alertus A, etc.). Availability may vary by region.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Levocetirizine acts by competitively and reversibly binding to peripheral H1 receptors. This action inhibits histamine-mediated vascular permeability, vasodilation, and other allergic responses.  Zinc’s role is less clearly defined; it may have some antiviral properties and support immune function. It potentially influences the activity of immune cells and viral replication.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Levocetirizine:** Rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentration occurs in about 0.9 hours. Food may slightly delay absorption but does not affect overall bioavailability. Minimally metabolized in the liver. Primarily excreted unchanged in urine, with a half-life of approximately 7.9 hours.
* **Zinc Gluconate:** Absorption is variable and influenced by dietary factors (phytates, calcium). Transported and stored in various tissues. Excess zinc is excreted primarily in feces.

**Mode of Action:** Levocetirizine competitively antagonizes histamine at the H1 receptor. This prevents the downstream signaling cascade responsible for allergic symptoms. The mechanism through which zinc gluconate affects cold symptoms is not fully understood.

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation**: Levocetirizine selectively binds to and blocks peripheral H1 receptors. Zinc influences immune function. The precise interactions remain subject to ongoing research.

**Elimination pathways:** Levocetirizine: Renal (primarily) - approximately 85% of an oral dose.  Zinc Gluconate: Fecal (primarily).


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 5 mg of levocetirizine and 10-50 mg of elemental zinc, once daily. Always consult the specific product labeling.

#### **Children:** Dosage is weight- or age-dependent and should be determined by a healthcare professional. Levocetirizine is not recommended for infants under 6 months old.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustment is recommended in elderly patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage must be adjusted based on creatinine clearance. Contraindicated in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and patients on dialysis. See dosing guidelines under "Children" for specifics.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No dose adjustment is generally necessary for patients with solely hepatic impairment. Adjustment is necessary in patients with both hepatic and renal impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consult product information for specific comorbidities. Use caution with concurrent CNS depressants.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of levocetirizine and zinc gluconate is typically not indicated for specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  It is primarily used for the management of allergic symptoms and common cold symptoms.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

See "Special Cases" above.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Drowsiness, fatigue, dry mouth, headache, nausea, diarrhea. In children, fever or cough may occur.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Angioedema, anaphylaxis, seizures, visual disturbances, difficulty urinating, weakness.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic complications from prolonged use are rare but not entirely ruled out. Long-term high doses of zinc may result in copper deficiency.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Any signs of allergic reaction (rash, itching, hives, swelling), angioedema, anaphylaxis, and seizures require immediate medical attention.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to levocetirizine, cetirizine, hydroxyzine, or any component of the formulation. End-stage renal disease, patients undergoing dialysis. Children under 2 years (some formulations) or under 6 (for tablets). Children with any degree of renal impairment should not take levocetirizine. Known zinc allergy.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Levocetirizine:**  Few clinically significant interactions. Concomitant use with sedating medications or alcohol may increase drowsiness.  Theophylline may slightly decrease levocetirizine clearance.
* **Zinc Gluconate:** Can interact with certain antibiotics (tetracyclines, quinolones), reducing their absorption.  May also interact with thiazide diuretics, penicillamine, and other drugs.
* **Food and lifestyle factors:** Avoid alcohol while taking this combination due to potential additive sedative effects. Avoid foods high in calcium or phosphorus shortly before or after taking zinc, as they can impair its absorption.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Levocetirizine:**  Pregnancy Category B.  Use only when clearly needed. Discuss risks and benefits with your doctor.  Excreted into breast milk – caution is recommended. Consider risks versus benefits.
* **Zinc Gluconate:**  Generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding at recommended doses. However, excessive zinc intake should be avoided.
