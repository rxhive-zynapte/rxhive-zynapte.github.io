## **Usage**

- Levosalbutamol + Theophylline is prescribed for the management of chronic respiratory diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It provides relief from symptoms like coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath.  It is also used to treat acute asthma attacks and exercise-induced bronchospasm.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Bronchodilator (Levosalbutamol), Xanthine and Phosphodiesterase Inhibitor (Theophylline).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Levosalbutamol relaxes the airway muscles by stimulating beta-2 adrenergic receptors. Theophylline relaxes airway smooth muscles and also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties. The combination enhances bronchodilation and improves airflow.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate generic names exist.
- **Brand Names:** Theo-Levolin, Theo Asthalin, Asthakind-LS, and numerous others (vary by region).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Levosalbutamol, a beta-2 adrenergic agonist, stimulates beta-2 receptors in the lungs, leading to bronchodilation. Theophylline, a methylxanthine, inhibits phosphodiesterase, increases intracellular cAMP, and relaxes bronchial smooth muscles. It also has anti-inflammatory effects.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Both drugs are absorbed orally.  Levosalbutamol is metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted renally. Theophylline is also metabolized in the liver, by CYP450 enzymes (especially CYP1A2 and CYP3A4) and eliminated renally. 
- **Mode of Action:** Levosalbutamol binds to beta-2 adrenergic receptors, activating adenylate cyclase, increasing cAMP, and relaxing bronchial smooth muscles. Theophylline inhibits phosphodiesterase, which hydrolyzes cAMP, thereby increasing cAMP levels, causing bronchodilation, and having anti-inflammatory effects. It may also act as an adenosine receptor antagonist.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Both are primarily eliminated through renal excretion after hepatic metabolism, with theophylline being metabolized by CYP450 enzymes.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

-  Levosalbutamol: 1-2 mg three times daily.
-  Theophylline: Individualized based on serum levels, typically starting at 300 mg daily and adjusted based on therapeutic response and serum concentration (target range usually 10-20 mcg/mL).
- Administered orally as syrup or tablets.

#### **Children:**

- Dosing is based on age and weight, requiring careful calculation and monitoring. Refer to pediatric dosage charts specific for the combined formulation or individual components for precise guidelines.
- **Pediatric Safety Considerations:** Children might be more susceptible to side effects; careful monitoring is mandatory.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Lower starting doses and careful monitoring are recommended due to age-related changes in drug clearance.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is usually required based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction is often needed due to reduced drug metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with cardiac disease, hypertension, diabetes, or hyperthyroidism.


### **Clinical Use Cases**
Dosage should be adjusted based on clinical response and serum theophylline levels.  The information provided here is not a substitute for expert consultation.

- **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:**  These situations may necessitate IV administration of aminophylline (theophylline's water-soluble salt) under close monitoring, with dosage adjustments as needed.
- **Emergency Situations (e.g., acute asthma exacerbation):** Nebulized levosalbutamol is typically the initial treatment of choice, along with other measures like oxygen and systemic corticosteroids.  Theophylline is not typically used in emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose modification is based on serum theophylline concentration, renal/hepatic function, age, other medical conditions, and concomitant medications. Therapeutic drug monitoring is essential for optimizing efficacy and minimizing toxicity.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, insomnia, restlessness, tremors, palpitations, increased heart rate, and muscle cramps.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Seizures, severe arrhythmias, and allergic reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Potential for dependence on theophylline with long-term use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and severe gastrointestinal disturbances.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to levosalbutamol or theophylline.
- Severe uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, especially tachyarrhythmias.
- Active peptic ulcer.
- Uncontrolled seizure disorders.


## **Drug Interactions**

- **Beta-blockers:** Antagonize the bronchodilatory effects of levosalbutamol.
- **CYP450 inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital):** Decrease theophylline levels.
- **CYP450 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluvoxamine, macrolide antibiotics):** Increase theophylline levels, increasing the risk of toxicity.
- **Other xanthines (e.g., caffeine):** Additive effects and increased risk of adverse events.
- **Lithium:** Theophylline may decrease lithium levels.
- **Other sympathomimetics:** Additive cardiovascular effects.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category (FDA):** C (Theophylline). Consult specialists for assessment of potential risks vs. benefits before use in pregnancy. Levosalbutamol effects on human pregnancy are not well established.
- **Breastfeeding:** Both drugs are excreted in breast milk; caution advised. Monitor infant for potential side effects like irritability and poor sleep.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
