## **Usage**

Lidocaine + Liver Fraction 2 Derived From Fresh Liver 01 is indicated for the treatment of liver disease.  Lidocaine, a local anesthetic, offers pain relief. Liver Fraction 2, derived from animal livers, is a nutritional supplement that provides essential nutrients like vitamin B12, folic acid, and iron, supporting liver function and addressing pernicious anemia (vitamin B12 deficiency).

- **Pharmacological Classification:**
    - Lidocaine: Local anesthetic, Class IB antiarrhythmic.
    - Liver Fraction 2: Nutritional supplement.

- **Mechanism of Action:**
    - Lidocaine: Stabilizes neuronal membranes, inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for initiating and conducting nerve impulses. This effectively blocks nerve signals, reducing pain sensation.
    - Liver Fraction 2: Provides nutritional support crucial for liver health and function and helps treat pernicious anemia.

## **Alternate Names**

- Lidocaine Hydrochloride + Liver Fraction 2 Derived From Fresh Liver 01
- Lignocaine + Liver Fraction 2 Derived From Fresh Liver 01
- Whole Liver Extra Injection (brand name according to some sources)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**
    - Lidocaine: Blocks sodium channels in nerve fibers, thus inhibiting nerve impulse initiation and conduction, leading to local anesthesia.
    - Liver Fraction 2: Provides essential nutrients (vitamin B12, folic acid, iron) which promote liver health and function. It also helps in treating pernicious anemia by replenishing vitamin B12 levels.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Lidocaine: Rapid absorption following parenteral administration, metabolized mainly in the liver (primarily by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4), and excreted via kidneys (small amount remains unchanged). The half-life is roughly 1.5 to 2 hours, but can be extended in hepatic impairment.
    - Liver Fraction 2: Pharmacokinetic details are not specifically available.

- **Mode of Action:** Lidocaine acts by blocking sodium channels, which are essential for nerve impulse transmission. Liver Fraction 2 functions by providing nutritional support to the liver.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Lidocaine is mainly eliminated via hepatic metabolism with renal excretion of metabolites and a small amount of unchanged drug.


## **Dosage**

This medication is administered intravenously by a healthcare professional. Self-administration is not recommended. Dosage is determined by the physician based on the individual patient's condition and the severity of liver disease.

### **Standard Dosage**

Information on standard dosage is not available in the provided sources. The dosage will be individualized to the patient.

#### **Adults:**

Dosage recommendations for adults are not specified in the available sources.

#### **Children:**

Pediatric dosing information is unavailable. However, caution is advised in children under 3 years old, using lidocaine only when other treatments are ineffective. Close monitoring is crucial due to potential toxicity.

#### **Special Cases:**

Dosage adjustments based on renal/hepatic dysfunction or comorbid conditions should be made under the guidance of a physician.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage guidelines specific to clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, or ICU use are not available in the provided sources.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications will be determined by the physician based on individual patient factors, hepatic/renal function, and other medical conditions.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Limited data available. The sources do not mention common side effects for the combined medication.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Methemoglobinemia (Lidocaine): Symptoms include bluish or grayish skin discoloration, headache, rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Requires immediate medical intervention.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term effect information specific to this combination is not available.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs include methemoglobinemia (associated with lidocaine) and necessitate immediate intervention.


## **Contraindications**

- Known hypersensitivity to lidocaine or amide-type local anesthetics.
- Severe liver disease.
- Certain heart conditions (e.g., heart block, severe shock).


## **Drug Interactions**

- Medications that prolong the QT interval (e.g., certain antiarrhythmics, antibiotics) may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias when taken with lidocaine.
- Beta-blockers can reduce hepatic blood flow, thus potentially affecting lidocaine metabolism.
- CYP3A4 inhibitors and CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., some antifungals, macrolides) may decrease lidocaine clearance.
- Alcohol should be avoided, as it may exacerbate liver damage.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Lidocaine's safety during pregnancy isn't fully established. Use cautiously and only if potential benefits exceed the risks.
- **Breastfeeding:** Lidocaine is considered safe while breastfeeding, as it passes into breast milk in minimal amounts.  However, it's crucial to discuss with your doctor before using any medication while breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Lidocaine blocks nerve signals; Liver Fraction 2 offers nutritional support.
- **Side Effects:**  Limited data. Serious side effects: Methemoglobinemia (lidocaine).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to lidocaine or amide-type anesthetics, severe liver disease, some heart conditions.
- **Drug Interactions:**  Drugs prolonging QT interval, beta-blockers, CYP3A4 inhibitors, alcohol.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Lidocaine: Use with caution if pregnant. Safe during breastfeeding.

## **Popular Combinations**

Specific information on frequently used drug combinations is not available.

## **Precautions**

- General precautions: Pre-screening for allergies, organ dysfunction, and metabolic disorders.
- Specific populations: Consult a physician regarding dosage adjustments in elderly patients, children, and patients with liver disease.
- Lifestyle considerations: Avoid alcohol and smoking.
