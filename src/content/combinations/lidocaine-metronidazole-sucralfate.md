## **Usage**

Lidocaine + Metronidazole + Sucralfate is a combination medication primarily prescribed for the treatment of anorectal disorders.  These include:

* **Anal fissures:** Small tears in the lining of the anus.
* **Fistulas:** Abnormal connections or passages near the anus.
* **Hemorrhoids (piles):** Swollen and inflamed veins in the rectum and anus.
* **Bedsores:** Sores on the skin appearing on areas of the body under pressure
* **Post-anorectal surgery:** Preventing infections and promoting healing.

**Pharmacological Classifications:**

* **Lidocaine:** Local anesthetic, amide type.
* **Metronidazole:** Antibiotic, nitroimidazole.
* **Sucralfate:** Gastrointestinal protectant. Also used topically as a protectant.


## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication may be referred to as:

* Lignocaine + Metronidazole + Sucralfate
* Sucralfate + Metronidazole + Lidocaine

**Brand Names:**

Brand names may vary depending on the region and manufacturer. Some examples based on the source include:
* Sucral Ano cream
* Crema Ano cream
* Ano metrogyl cream
* Cremagel Ano

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Lidocaine:** Blocks voltage-gated sodium channels in neuronal membranes, inhibiting nerve impulse transmission and producing local anesthesia. This action reduces pain in the anorectal area.
* **Metronidazole:** Disrupts DNA synthesis and structure in susceptible anaerobic bacteria and protozoa, leading to their death. This action prevents and treats infections in the affected area.
* **Sucralfate:** Forms a protective barrier on the mucosal surface of the anorectal area, protecting it from further irritation by gastric acid, bile salts, and digestive enzymes. Additionally, it stimulates prostaglandin synthesis, promotes local blood flow, and facilitates tissue repair and healing.


**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Lidocaine:** When applied topically, lidocaine is absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes but generally has low systemic absorption in the case of anorectal application. It is metabolized in the liver by CYP enzymes and excreted renally.
* **Metronidazole:** Topical application leads to limited systemic absorption. After absorption, it is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine.
* **Sucralfate:** It is minimally absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when applied topically so it has negligible systemic effects. The small amount that is absorbed is excreted mainly through the kidneys.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a small amount of the cream/ointment/gel to the clean and dry affected area of the anus, typically two to four times a day or as directed by the physician.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** As topical administration leads to limited systemic absorption, dose adjustment is usually not required.  However, caution is advised.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Assess patient-specific factors, such as diabetes or blood disorders, before prescribing.

### **Clinical Use Cases**


The dosage in clinical settings for indications other than anal fissures, fistulae, and hemorrhoids is not specified in the sources provided. However, it has been indicated for pressure sores (bed sores).
