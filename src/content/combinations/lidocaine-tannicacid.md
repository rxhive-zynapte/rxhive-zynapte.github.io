## **Usage**

Lidocaine + Tannic Acid is prescribed for the topical treatment of painful oral lesions such as mouth ulcers (aphthous ulcers/canker sores), gum inflammation (gingivitis), and other oral mucosal irritations or injuries. It is also used to alleviate discomfort associated with new dentures or orthodontic appliances.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

*   Lidocaine: Local anesthetic, antiarrhythmic
*   Tannic Acid: Astringent, antiseptic

**Mechanism of Action:**

Lidocaine provides pain relief by blocking nerve signals at the application site, leading to numbness. Tannic acid forms a protective layer over the affected area, reducing inflammation and potentially exhibiting antiviral and antibacterial properties.

## **Alternate Names**

*   Lidocaine-Tannic Acid combination
*   Orasep-LA (brand name)
*   Dentakind-L Gum Astringent (brand name)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Lidocaine stabilizes neuronal membranes by inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels. This blocks nerve impulse initiation and conduction, leading to local anesthesia. Tannic acid precipitates proteins, forming a protective barrier and reducing inflammation.  It may also exert some antiviral and antibacterial effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Topical application leads to localized action with minimal systemic absorption. Some lidocaine may be absorbed through mucosal membranes. Lidocaine is metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, while tannic acid is broken down in the gastrointestinal tract. Excretion of lidocaine is mostly renal, while the metabolites of tannic acid are eliminated through various routes.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

A thin layer of gel or ointment is applied to the affected area every 3-4 hours, or as directed by a physician. Maximum daily dosage should be considered based on individual patient factors and product-specific guidelines.

#### **Children:**

Use in children should be under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Apply a smaller amount to the affected area than in adults.  For children younger than 3 years old, lidocaine-containing products should be used with extreme caution due to the potential for toxicity. Avoid use for teething pain in infants.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution, monitoring for potential age-related changes in drug metabolism.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; dosage adjustments may be necessary.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution; dosage adjustments may be necessary.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring is advised for patients with cardiovascular disease or allergies.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The clinical use of Lidocaine + Tannic Acid is limited to topical treatment of oral lesions and gum inflammation. It is not for systemic use.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are rarely needed. Consider patient-specific factors, especially the extent of oral lesions or mucosal involvement.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Temporary burning or stinging sensation at the application site
*   Numbness at the application site

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
*   Signs of lidocaine toxicity (e.g., seizures, dizziness, confusion, irregular heartbeat)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

No significant long-term adverse effects are typically associated with topical use as directed.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions or systemic lidocaine toxicity require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

*   Known hypersensitivity to lidocaine, tannic acid, or any component of the formulation.
*   Large open wounds or severely irritated/damaged oral mucosa.


## **Drug Interactions**

No significant drug interactions are typically expected with topical use as directed.  However, caution should be exercised in patients taking other medications metabolized by the liver, especially those with pre-existing liver conditions.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult a doctor before using during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
