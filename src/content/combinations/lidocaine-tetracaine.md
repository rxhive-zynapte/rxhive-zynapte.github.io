## **Usage**

Lidocaine + Tetracaine cream is a topical anesthetic indicated for use on intact skin in adults to provide local analgesia for superficial dermatological procedures. These procedures include dermal filler injections, pulsed dye laser therapy, facial laser resurfacing, and laser-assisted tattoo removal.  It falls under the pharmacological classification of local anesthetics, specifically a combination of an amide local anesthetic (lidocaine) and an ester local anesthetic (tetracaine). The mechanism of action involves blocking sodium channels in nerve fibers, thereby inhibiting nerve impulse initiation and conduction, leading to a localized loss of sensation.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Lidocaine + Tetracaine" is the generic name, the combination is marketed under various brand names, most notably Pliaglis and Synera. There might be other international or regional brand name variations as well.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Lidocaine + Tetracaine exerts its anesthetic effect by reversibly binding to sodium channels within neuronal cell membranes. This binding action prevents the influx of sodium ions, which are essential for depolarization and subsequent propagation of nerve impulses. The combined action of both anesthetics results in enhanced and prolonged local anesthesia.

**Pharmacokinetics:** After topical application to intact skin, both lidocaine and tetracaine are absorbed into the systemic circulation.  However, the extent of absorption is limited, minimizing systemic side effects. Lidocaine is metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP enzymes, while tetracaine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterases.  Both drugs and their metabolites are primarily excreted via the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:**  The combination acts locally on sensory nerve endings in the skin. It blocks sodium channels, preventing the transmission of pain signals to the brain. The eutectic mixture of lidocaine and tetracaine in the cream formulation ensures that both drugs are in a liquid oil state at room temperature, allowing for better skin penetration.

**Elimination Pathways:** Lidocaine is metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Tetracaine is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma, with the resulting metabolites excreted renally.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  A thick layer of cream is applied to intact skin 20-30 minutes before procedures like dermal filler injections, pulsed dye laser therapy, or facial resurfacing, and 60 minutes before laser-assisted tattoo removal. The amount to apply is based on the surface area being treated.

#### **Children:**  Lidocaine + Tetracaine is not indicated for use in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age. 

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:**  Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the systemic effects, but dosage adjustments are not typically required. Monitor closely.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary. Monitor closely for systemic toxicity.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Patients with severe hepatic disease are at greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations due to impaired metabolism. Exercise caution and consider dosage adjustment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with certain medical conditions, such as severe cardiovascular disease, as they may be more susceptible to adverse effects.

### **Clinical Use Cases:** Lidocaine + Tetracaine is primarily intended for superficial dermatological procedures as mentioned above.  Its use for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations is generally not recommended as other, more potent anesthetic agents are typically employed in those settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments:** Dose modifications should be considered in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism. Consultation with a specialist may be warranted.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:** Localized skin reactions (erythema, edema, pruritus, blanching, and/or discoloration at the application site).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:** Methemoglobinemia (characterized by cyanosis, headache, tachycardia, dyspnea, lightheadedness, and/or fatigue), allergic reactions (including urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, and/or shock), and systemic toxicity (CNS excitation or depression manifesting as dizziness, lightheadedness, seizures, respiratory depression, and/or cardiac arrest).

### **Long-Term Effects:** Long-term effects of topical Lidocaine + Tetracaine use are unlikely due to its localized action and limited systemic absorption when used as directed.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Clinically significant ADRs include methemoglobinemia and allergic reactions, requiring prompt intervention.

## **Contraindications**

- Known hypersensitivity to lidocaine, tetracaine, local anesthetics of the amide or ester type, or para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA).
- Application to broken or irritated skin, mucous membranes, or near the eyes.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Other local anesthetics (additive systemic effects).
- Class I antiarrhythmics (additive cardiac depressant effects).
- Medications that can induce methemoglobinemia (e.g., sulfonamides, nitrates).

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Lidocaine + Tetracaine is categorized as Pregnancy Category B.  While animal studies have not shown fetal harm, adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women are lacking.  Use during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Lidocaine is excreted in breast milk; the extent of tetracaine excretion is unknown. Exercise caution when administering to breastfeeding women. Avoid applying the cream directly to the nipple or areola.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Sodium channel blocker, inhibiting nerve impulse initiation and conduction.
- **Side Effects:** Localized skin reactions, methemoglobinemia, allergic reactions, systemic toxicity.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to ingredients, broken skin, mucous membranes.
- **Drug Interactions:** Other local anesthetics, Class I antiarrhythmics, medications inducing methemoglobinemia.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category B; caution advised during breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** Apply a thick layer to intact skin 20-60 minutes before the procedure, depending on the procedure.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Observe for signs of methemoglobinemia and allergic reactions.



## **Popular Combinations:**  Lidocaine + Tetracaine is typically used as a single-entity formulation and not commonly combined with other drugs in a single topical preparation.

## **Precautions**

- Ensure skin integrity before application.
- Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes.
- Monitor for signs of local and systemic adverse effects.
- Use caution in patients with hepatic disease, cardiovascular disease, or other relevant comorbidities.
