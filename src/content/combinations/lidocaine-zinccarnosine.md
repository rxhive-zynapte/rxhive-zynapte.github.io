## **Usage**

Lidocaine + Zinc Carnosine is primarily prescribed for the treatment of painful mouth ulcers (aphthous stomatitis).  It combines the local anesthetic action of lidocaine with the potential mucosal protective and wound-healing effects of zinc carnosine. It can also be used as a zinc supplement. Other uses include treatment of gastric ulcers, pain, itching, sunburn, burns, premature ejaculation, and erectile dysfunction.

It can be categorized as a combination drug with local anesthetic and nutritional supplement properties.

Lidocaine works by blocking sodium channels, inhibiting nerve impulse transmission and reducing pain. Zinc carnosine's mechanism is not fully understood but is thought to involve antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and growth-promoting effects on the mucosal lining.

## **Alternate Names**

Polaprezinc, PepZin GIâ„¢

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Lidocaine blocks voltage-gated sodium channels, thus preventing pain signal transmission. Zinc carnosine stabilizes and protects the gastric and intestinal mucosal lining, promoting ulcer healing. This may involve antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and growth factor-stimulating effects. It also enhances gastric lining integrity.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Lidocaine is absorbed through mucous membranes; systemic absorption from topical oral application is minimal but can increase with application to damaged skin. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted renally. Zinc carnosine's pharmacokinetics after topical oral administration are not well-characterized. However, when taken orally it slowly dissociates in the gastrointestinal tract, the zinc is poorly absorbed, being primarily eliminated in feces. Carnosine is further metabolized to L-histidine which is primarily used in the production of proteins.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
A pea-sized amount of gel applied directly to the mouth ulcer 3-4 times daily. Avoid eating or drinking for at least 30 minutes post-application. As a zinc supplement, 75 mg three times daily or 150 mg twice daily is used. For other conditions, such as gastric ulcers or taste impairment, 75-150 mg of Zinc Carnosine can be taken twice or thrice a day.

#### **Children:**  Use in children should be under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** 100 mg Zinc Carnosine daily is recommended due to potentially reduced digestive function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised in severe renal impairment due to the systemic absorption of lidocaine.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution advised in severe hepatic impairment due to potential for reduced lidocaine metabolism. Medical supervision is needed.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  
Lidocaine, when used intravenously, is given at 1.5 mg/kg 3 minutes before intubation. For suctioning intubated patients, endotracheal lidocaine can be administered at 5-6 mg/kg. Specific dosage for Lidocaine + Zinc Carnosine is not established for clinical situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
Adjustments are based on patient response, tolerability, renal/hepatic function, and age.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
Burning or stinging at the application site (transient). Nausea, indigestion, and stomach pain can also occur.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, swelling). Depression and convulsions have been reported.

### **Long-Term Effects**  
No significant long-term effects are known with topical use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).

## **Contraindications**
Hypersensitivity to lidocaine, zinc, or carnosine. Severe liver or kidney disease. Burns, eczema, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Drug allergies.

## **Drug Interactions**
Other local anesthetics (additive effects), drugs that prolong the QT interval (increased risk of arrhythmias), medications affecting liver enzymes (altered lidocaine metabolism). Amiodarone and codeine.  Corticosteroids (such as prednisone and dexamethasone). Medications affecting blood coagulation (like warfarin and heparin). Other local anesthetics (including bupivacaine and ropivacaine) may interact with lidocaine. Alcohol may interact. Interaction with medications for diabetes may cause blood sugar to drop too low.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
Consult with a physician before using during these stages. The safety of Lidocaine + Zinc Carnosine during pregnancy hasn't been established. Lidocaine is present in breast milk, generally considered safe. However, zinc carnosine's impact on infants isn't well studied. Breastfeeding is probably safe if prescribed.
