## **Usage**

Light mineral oil and white mineral oil are essentially the same substance, with "white mineral oil" referring to a highly refined and purified form. They are prescribed for the treatment of dry eyes and occasional constipation.  Pharmacologically, they are classified as emollients (skin softeners) and lubricants, and as laxatives when taken orally. In ophthalmic preparations, they lubricate the ocular surface, providing temporary relief from burning, irritation, and discomfort associated with dry eyes.  Orally, mineral oil acts as a lubricant laxative, softening stool and facilitating passage through the intestines.

## **Alternate Names**

Light liquid paraffin, liquid petrolatum, paraffin oil, paraffinum liquidum, white mineral oil (highly refined), heavy mineral oil, mineral oil mist. Brand names vary depending on the formulation and intended use (e.g., baby oil, various ophthalmic lubricants).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics (Ophthalmic):** Light mineral oil and white mineral oil lubricate the ocular surface, reducing friction and irritation. They create a protective film that helps retain moisture and prevents further drying.

**Pharmacokinetics (Ophthalmic):** Minimal systemic absorption is expected with topical ophthalmic use.

**Pharmacodynamics (Oral):**  Mineral oil softens the stool by hindering the absorption of water from the colon. It also lubricates the intestinal walls, easing the passage of fecal matter.

**Pharmacokinetics (Oral):**  Orally administered mineral oil is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is eliminated unchanged in the feces.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (Ophthalmic):**  Instill 1-2 drops in the affected eye(s) as needed.

#### **Children (Ophthalmic):** Use as directed by a physician.

#### **Adults (Oral Laxative):** 15-45 mL orally, single or divided doses.

#### **Children (Oral Laxative):**  Dosage is dependent upon age and should be directed by a physician. Children under 6 should generally avoid oral mineral oil due to the risk of aspiration.

#### **Special Cases:**  Dosage adjustments are not typically required in elderly patients, or those with hepatic or renal impairments when used ophthalmically. For oral use, caution should be taken in the elderly, debilitated, or bedridden patients due to risk of aspiration. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding should only occur under the guidance of a physician.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources did not mention dosage recommendations for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. The Light mineral oil + White mineral oil combination, as described, is generally used for dry eyes (ophthalmic) or constipation (oral).  Other clinical uses are not described within these sources.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects (Ophthalmic):**  Temporary blurred vision, eye irritation, or stinging.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects (Ophthalmic):** Allergic reactions.

### **Common Side Effects (Oral):**  Abdominal cramping, nausea, diarrhea, anal leakage.  

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects (Oral):**  Aspiration pneumonia (particularly in young children, elderly individuals, or those with swallowing difficulties), lipid pneumonia, deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) with chronic use.


## **Contraindications**

**Ophthalmic:** Hypersensitivity to mineral oil.

**Oral:**  Appendicitis or symptoms suggestive of appendicitis, bowel obstruction, fecal impaction, bowel perforation, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis. Use with caution in bedridden, geriatric, debilitated, or pregnant patients.

## **Drug Interactions**

**Ophthalmic:**  Maintain a 5-15 minute gap between the application of mineral oil and other ophthalmic medications. Consult a physician regarding specific interactions.

**Oral:**  Mineral oil can interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), oral contraceptives, and some medications (e.g., warfarin, digoxin). Consult a physician regarding specific interactions.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Ophthalmic:**  Consult with a physician before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  

**Oral:**  Avoid oral mineral oil during pregnancy unless specifically recommended by a physician. It's unknown whether mineral oil passes into breast milk. Consult with a physician before use while breastfeeding.
