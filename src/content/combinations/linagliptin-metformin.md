## **Usage**

- Linagliptin + Metformin is prescribed as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus when treatment with both linagliptin and metformin is appropriate.  It is not indicated for type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antidiabetic combination containing a DPP-4 inhibitor (linagliptin) and a biguanide (metformin).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Linagliptin inhibits the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), which prolongs the action of incretin hormones like GLP-1 and GIP. These hormones increase insulin release and decrease glucagon secretion, thereby lowering blood glucose levels. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.

## **Alternate Names**

-  International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Linagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride
- **Brand Names:** Jentadueto, Jentadueto XR, Trajenta Duo, Trajentamet (regional variations exist).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Linagliptin increases insulin secretion and decreases glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - *Absorption:*  Linagliptin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1 to 4 hours. Metformin is absorbed slowly and incompletely from the gastrointestinal tract.
    - *Metabolism:* Linagliptin is primarily excreted unchanged in the bile and feces, with minimal hepatic metabolism.  Metformin is not metabolized.
    - *Elimination:* Linagliptin is eliminated mainly through biliary/fecal excretion (approximately 85%) with a small portion through urinary excretion. Metformin is excreted unchanged by the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:** Linagliptin competitively binds to and inhibits DPP-4. Metformin's exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it is thought to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), leading to downstream metabolic effects.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Linagliptin is primarily eliminated via biliary/fecal excretion. Metformin is eliminated via renal excretion.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Immediate-release tablets:**
    - Initial (not currently on metformin): Linagliptin 2.5 mg/Metformin 500 mg orally twice daily.
    - Initial (currently on metformin): Linagliptin 2.5 mg plus half the current metformin dose, twice daily.
    - Maintenance: Titrate gradually up to a maximum of Linagliptin 2.5 mg/Metformin 1000 mg twice daily.

* **Extended-release tablets:**
    - Initial (not currently on metformin): Linagliptin 5 mg/Metformin 1000 mg orally once daily.
    - Initial (currently on metformin): Linagliptin 5 mg and a similar total daily dose of metformin once daily.
    - Maintenance: Titrate based on efficacy and tolerability, not exceeding 5 mg linagliptin/2000 mg metformin once daily.

#### **Children:**  Use is not recommended in pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Monitor renal function closely due to age-related decline. Dose adjustment may be necessary based on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  
    - eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²: Contraindicated.
    - eGFR 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m²: Not recommended to initiate. If already on treatment, assess risks and benefits of continuing.  If discontinued due to renal impairment, linagliptin can be continued as monotherapy.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Not recommended due to increased risk of lactic acidosis with metformin.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor closely for potential drug interactions and adjust dosage as needed.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Linagliptin + Metformin is specifically indicated for chronic management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It is not indicated for acute settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are primarily made based on renal function (for metformin) and individual patient response.

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

-  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort (primarily metformin-related).
- Upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis.
- Headache.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Lactic acidosis (metformin).
- Pancreatitis (though rare, requires immediate discontinuation).
-  Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., angioedema, urticaria).

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Vitamin B12 deficiency (metformin, monitor levels periodically).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Lactic acidosis (metformin) is a serious ADR requiring immediate medical intervention.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to linagliptin or metformin.
-  Severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²).
-  Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis.
-  Hepatic impairment.
-  Conditions predisposing to tissue hypoxia (e.g., acute heart failure, respiratory failure).

## **Drug Interactions**

- Cationic drugs (e.g., cimetidine) may compete with metformin for renal tubular secretion.
-  Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and other drugs that alkalinize urine may increase metformin concentrations.
- Certain drugs that inhibit organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) can reduce metformin renal clearance.
-  Alcohol can increase the risk of lactic acidosis with metformin.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Limited human data are available.  Generally, insulin is preferred for managing diabetes during pregnancy.
- **Breastfeeding:** Metformin is excreted in breast milk. Limited data suggest low levels of linagliptin in breast milk. It's generally recommended to choose alternative therapies or to discontinue breastfeeding if this medication is necessary.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** DPP-4 inhibition (linagliptin) and reduction of hepatic glucose production/increased insulin sensitivity (metformin).
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, lactic acidosis (rare but serious), pancreatitis (rare).
- **Contraindications:** Renal impairment, hepatic impairment, metabolic acidosis.
- **Drug Interactions:** Cationic drugs, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, OCT2 inhibitors.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; insulin generally preferred.
- **Dosage:** Varies depending on formulation and renal function; see detailed dosage section.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  HbA1c, fasting and postprandial glucose, renal function (especially in elderly), Vitamin B12 levels (long-term metformin use).



## **Popular Combinations**

-  Linagliptin + Metformin is often used in combination with other antidiabetic agents like sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), or insulin if dual therapy is insufficient.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess renal function before initiating and periodically during treatment. Monitor for signs of lactic acidosis.
- **Specific Populations:**

    - **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Limited data available; consider alternate therapies.
    - **Children & Elderly:** Not recommended for children; monitor renal function closely in the elderly.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Encourage diet and exercise.  Limit alcohol consumption.
