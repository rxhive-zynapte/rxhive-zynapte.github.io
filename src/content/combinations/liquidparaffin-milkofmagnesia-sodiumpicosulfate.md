## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the treatment of **constipation**.  It combines three different types of laxatives to relieve constipation: a stimulant laxative (sodium picosulfate), a lubricant laxative (liquid paraffin), and an osmotic laxative (milk of magnesia). This combination is classified as a **laxative**.

The mechanism of action involves multiple pathways. Sodium picosulfate stimulates the intestinal mucosa after being metabolized, increasing peristalsis. Liquid paraffin lubricates the intestinal walls and softens the stool, and milk of magnesia draws water into the intestines, resulting in softer and easier-to-pass stools.

## **Alternate Names**

No specific alternate names exist for this particular combination, although the individual components may have synonyms. Brand names for products containing this combination vary regionally.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Sodium Picosulfate:** This stimulant laxative is metabolized by colonic bacteria into its active form, bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-pyridyl-2-methane (BHPM). BHPM stimulates sensory nerve endings in the colonic mucosa, increasing intestinal motility and water and electrolyte secretion into the bowel lumen.

* **Liquid Paraffin:** This lubricant laxative coats the stool and intestinal wall, preventing water absorption and facilitating passage.

* **Milk of Magnesia (Magnesium Hydroxide):** This osmotic laxative draws water into the intestinal lumen, softening the stool and promoting peristalsis.  It can also neutralize stomach acid.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Sodium Picosulfate:** Orally administered sodium picosulfate is minimally absorbed and reaches the colon largely unchanged.  Colonic bacteria convert it to BHPM, the active metabolite, which exerts its laxative effects. The onset of action is typically 6-12 hours after ingestion.

* **Liquid Paraffin:**  Not absorbed systemically.  Excreted unchanged in the feces.

* **Milk of Magnesia:** Poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The small amount absorbed is excreted renally. Unabsorbed magnesium is excreted in the feces.

**Mode of Action:** See Pharmacodynamics. No receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation is directly involved with the laxative effects.

**Elimination Pathways:**

* **Sodium Picosulfate:** Excreted primarily in the feces as BHPM and other metabolites. Minimal renal excretion.
* **Liquid Paraffin:** Excreted unchanged in feces.
* **Milk of Magnesia:** Primarily excreted in feces. Minimal renal excretion.
