## **Usage**

Liquid Paraffin + White Soft Paraffin is primarily used as a topical emollient for the symptomatic relief of dry skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, and xerosis.  It is also used as an ocular lubricant for dry eye conditions and recurrent corneal epithelial erosion. Orally, liquid paraffin is used as a laxative for constipation. It is not classified as an antibiotic, analgesic, or sedative, but as an emollient and laxative.
Its mechanism of action involves creating a protective barrier on the skin or eye surface to prevent water loss, thereby moisturizing and softening the affected area. When taken orally, liquid paraffin lubricates and softens fecal matter, facilitating bowel movements.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination doesn't have a specific international nonproprietary name (INN). It is often referred to simply as liquid paraffin and white soft paraffin or a combination of both. Brand names may vary depending on the region and formulation. Some examples include Oilatum, E45, and Diprobase.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

Topically, Liquid Paraffin and White Soft Paraffin work by forming an occlusive layer on the skin, which reduces transepidermal water loss and helps restore skin hydration.  In the eye, they lubricate the surface, relieving dryness and irritation. Orally, liquid paraffin lubricates fecal matter, easing passage through the intestines.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

Topically, there is minimal systemic absorption of either ingredient. Orally administered liquid paraffin is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is eliminated unchanged in the feces. The small amount that may be absorbed is metabolized by the liver and excreted in bile.

**Mode of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**

The primary mechanism of action is physical, creating a barrier to water loss. There is no receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation involved in their therapeutic effect.

**Elimination Pathways:**

Topically, minimal elimination occurs since the medication isn't significantly absorbed.  Orally administered liquid paraffin is primarily eliminated unchanged in the feces, with a small amount metabolized by the liver and excreted in bile.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Topical: Apply a thin layer to the affected area as needed, typically two to four times a day, or as directed by a physician. Oral: 10-30 ml daily in divided doses.

Liquid paraffin is sometimes given orally before procedures to clear the bowel. The dosage should be determined by the specific clinical context.
