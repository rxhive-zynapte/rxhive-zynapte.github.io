## **Usage**

Lornoxicam + Methyl Salicylate + Thiocolchicoside is a topical gel prescribed for the relief of pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal conditions like sprains, strains, and other localized injuries. It is also used to treat painful muscle spasms in conditions such as low back pain, neck pain, and osteoarthritis.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This combination drug includes a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) - Lornoxicam, a counterirritant - Methyl Salicylate, and a muscle relaxant - Thiocolchicoside.

**Mechanism of Action:** The gel works through the combined action of its components.  Lornoxicam reduces pain and inflammation, Methyl Salicylate provides a warming sensation that distracts from pain, and Thiocolchicoside relaxes muscles and relieves spasms.


## **Alternate Names**

Lornoxicam-Methyl Salicylate-Thiocolchicoside combination gel is also marketed under brand names like Lorchek-MR in India.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Lornoxicam inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and mitigating pain and inflammation. Methyl salicylate acts as a counterirritant, creating a warming sensation while also thought to contribute to peripheral COX inhibition. Thiocolchicoside is a centrally acting muscle relaxant, primarily impacting GABA receptors within the spinal cord to reduce muscle spasms and stiffness.

**Pharmacokinetics:** When applied topically, Lornoxicam has lower systemic absorption than oral formulations. Methyl salicylate is absorbed percutaneously and metabolized in the liver. Thiocolchicoside achieves some systemic absorption when applied topically.  Elimination pathways for the individual drugs vary, but generally involve hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer to the affected area 3-4 times daily, rubbing gently until absorbed.

#### **Children:** Use in children below 12 years is generally not recommended. For adolescents (12-18 years), use clinical judgment and consider dosage adjustments. Pediatric use should be under strict medical supervision.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution and start with a lower dose if necessary, monitoring for adverse effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use cautiously. Dose adjustments may be needed in moderate to severe impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use cautiously. Dosage adjustments may be required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution and monitor closely in patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease, bleeding disorders, asthma, or heart conditions.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination gel is primarily intended for topical application and not indicated for the listed clinical use cases (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations).  These procedures require systemic medications rather than topical gels.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be needed based on patient-specific factors, such as renal or hepatic dysfunction, other medical conditions, or potential drug interactions.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Application site reactions (burning, irritation, itching, redness).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Allergic reactions (angioedema, bronchospasm), systemic side effects of lornoxicam (e.g., gastrointestinal bleeding, renal impairment) are rare with topical use but possible with prolonged high doses or inadvertent ingestion. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (rare).

### **Long-Term Effects:**
Skin thinning or discoloration with prolonged use; Systemic effects are possible with chronic high-dose topical application.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any component; active peptic ulcer; severe renal or hepatic impairment; third trimester of pregnancy; breastfeeding (consult physician).


## **Drug Interactions**

Other NSAIDs (increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects); anticoagulants (increased bleeding risk); corticosteroids (increased risk of gastrointestinal ulceration).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy:** Contraindicated in the third trimester. Use with caution in the first and second trimesters only if potential benefits clearly outweigh risks.

**Breastfeeding:** Not recommended due to potential exposure of the infant.
