      Are there any contraindications to this medication?**


      **A:** Yes. Contraindications include hypersensitivity to any of the
      ingredients, active peptic ulcer, severe heart, liver, or kidney failure,
      and a history of asthma/urticaria following NSAID use.

  - q: >-
      How does this combination work differently from taking paracetamol or
      lornoxicam alone?**


      **A:**  This combination targets multiple pain pathways, offering
      potentially enhanced pain relief and reduced inflammation compared to
      single-agent therapy. Trypsin chymotrypsin adds anti-inflammatory effect
      by breaking down proteins at the site of injury.

      **A:** Chronic use, especially of the NSAID component (lornoxicam), can
      increase the risk of gastrointestinal issues, kidney problems, and
      cardiovascular events. Regular monitoring is recommended for long-term
      use.

## **Usage**

- This combination medication is prescribed for the relief of pain and inflammation associated with various conditions, including:
    - Osteoarthritis
    - Rheumatoid arthritis
    - Ankylosing spondylitis
    - Post-operative pain
    - Acute musculoskeletal conditions (e.g., sprains, strains, low back pain)
    - Primary dysmenorrhea (painful menstrual periods)

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) combined with analgesic and proteolytic enzymes.

- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination targets different pain pathways for a synergistic effect. Lornoxicam inhibits COX enzymes, reducing prostaglandin production (mediators of pain and inflammation). Paracetamol acts centrally to alter pain perception and reduce fever. Trypsin and chymotrypsin are proteolytic enzymes that break down proteins at the inflammation site, promoting healing and reducing edema.

## **Alternate Names**

- Lornoxicam-Paracetamol-Trypsin Chymotrypsin
- Brand Names: Lorchek Ptc, others (availability varies by region)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Lornoxicam exerts its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects by inhibiting both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, reducing the formation of prostaglandins. Paracetamol is believed to act centrally on the hypothalamic heat-regulating center and inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in the CNS. Trypsin and chymotrypsin facilitate the breakdown of proteins involved in the inflammatory response.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Lornoxicam is well-absorbed orally, extensively metabolized in the liver (primarily by CYP2C9), and excreted mainly by the kidneys.
    - Paracetamol is rapidly absorbed, also metabolized in the liver by conjugation with glucuronide and sulfate, with a small fraction undergoing CYP450-mediated oxidation to a reactive metabolite that is detoxified by glutathione. Excretion is primarily renal.
    - Trypsin and chymotrypsin are absorbed from the GI tract, undergo metabolism, and are eventually excreted.

- **Elimination Pathways:**
    - Lornoxicam: Primarily renal excretion.
    - Paracetamol: Primarily renal excretion.
    - Trypsin Chymotrypsin: Metabolic and excretory pathways not fully characterized.
