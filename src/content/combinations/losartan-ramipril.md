## **Usage**

- Losartan + Ramipril is prescribed for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure).  It can also be used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events like heart attack and stroke in high-risk patients. Losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), is sometimes used to treat diabetic nephropathy. Ramipril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is also used in heart failure management and to improve survival after a heart attack.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antihypertensive (a combination of an ARB and an ACE inhibitor).
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination works by blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Losartan blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that causes blood vessels to constrict. Ramipril prevents the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This combined action leads to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), reduced blood pressure, and decreased workload on the heart.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for the combination itself, though it is sometimes referred to as the losartan-ramipril combination.
- **Brand Names:**  Numerous brand names are available depending on the region and manufacturer.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Losartan + Ramipril lowers blood pressure by reducing systemic vascular resistance without significantly altering heart rate. This effect is achieved through the blockade of angiotensin II effects and inhibiting its formation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Both drugs are orally administered. Losartan is metabolized by the liver into an active metabolite, which contributes significantly to the drug's effect. Ramipril is also metabolized by the liver to ramiprilat, its active form. Both losartan and ramipril (and their active metabolites) are primarily excreted by the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:** Losartan selectively blocks angiotensin II at the AT1 receptor, preventing vasoconstriction. Ramipril blocks the angiotensin-converting enzyme, inhibiting the production of angiotensin II.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Losartan binds to the AT1 receptor. Ramipril inhibits ACE.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion, some hepatic metabolism.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- Starting dose: Losartan 50 mg + Ramipril 2.5 mg once daily.
- Maintenance dose:  Titrated up to Losartan 100 mg + Ramipril 5mg, if necessary.
- Maximum dose: Losartan 100mg + Ramipril 10mg once daily.

#### **Children:**
- Not generally recommended for pediatric use.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** Initial lower doses are advised with careful titration.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage reductions are necessary based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Lower starting doses are recommended.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Dose adjustments may be needed depending on the specific condition. For example, patients with heart failure after a heart attack may start with lower Ramipril doses.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Losartan + Ramipril's usage is primarily for chronic hypertension management, it's generally not indicated for acute situations. Therefore, its use in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, and emergency situations is not standard practice. Instead, other rapidly acting antihypertensives are preferred in those contexts.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are needed for patients with renal or hepatic impairment and may be required based on other comorbid conditions.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Dizziness
- Hypotension (especially orthostatic hypotension)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Angioedema (swelling of face, lips, tongue)
- Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels)
- Renal impairment


### **Long-Term Effects**

- Potential for renal dysfunction with long-term use


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Breastfeeding



## **Drug Interactions**

- Potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics (risk of hyperkalemia)
- NSAIDs (may reduce antihypertensive effect and worsen renal function)
- Lithium (increased lithium levels)
- Aliskiren (avoid concomitant use, increased risk of adverse events)
- Diabetes medications (may potentiate hypoglycemia with Ramipril)

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  D (contraindicated)
- Fetal risks include renal and lung damage, growth retardation, and even death.
- Excretion in breast milk is unknown for both drugs. Use is not recommended during breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Dual RAAS blockade (ARB and ACE inhibitor), lowering blood pressure.
- **Side Effects:** Dizziness, hypotension, cough, headache, hyperkalemia, angioedema.
- **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, hypersensitivity, bilateral renal artery stenosis.
- **Drug Interactions:**  Other antihypertensives, potassium supplements, NSAIDs, lithium.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
- **Dosage:** Start low and titrate (see detailed dosage section).
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, potassium levels, renal function.

## **Popular Combinations**

Losartan + Ramipril is itself a combination, often prescribed without adding another antihypertensive. However, if additional blood pressure control is needed, other agents like thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers may be considered.


## **Precautions**

- Monitor renal function and electrolytes, especially potassium.
- Caution in patients with hepatic impairment.
- Discontinue immediately if pregnancy occurs.
- Advise patients about the risk of first-dose hypotension.
- Avoid in patients with history of angioedema.
