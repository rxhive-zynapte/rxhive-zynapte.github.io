## **Usage**

Loteprednol etabonate + Tobramycin is prescribed for steroid-responsive ocular inflammations with a risk of superficial bacterial ocular infection.  This includes conditions like allergic conjunctivitis, acne rosacea of the eyelids, superficial punctate keratitis, herpes zoster keratitis (in conjunction with antiviral therapy), iritis, cyclitis, and selected cases of uveitis. Post-operative inflammation following ocular surgery may also be treated with this medication.

It is a combination drug belonging to the following pharmacological classifications:

* **Corticosteroid:** Loteprednol etabonate is a corticosteroid that reduces inflammation.
* **Aminoglycoside Antibiotic:** Tobramycin is an antibiotic that kills bacteria or prevents their growth.

The mechanism of action involves the combined effects of loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin. Loteprednol etabonate works by inhibiting the inflammatory response, while tobramycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

The generic name is Loteprednol etabonate + Tobramycin. A common brand name is Zylet.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

Loteprednol etabonate exerts its anti-inflammatory action by suppressing the migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and reversing increased capillary permeability. Tobramycin acts on the bacterial ribosome, inhibiting protein synthesis and leading to bacterial cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

Following topical ophthalmic administration, systemic absorption of both drugs is minimal. Loteprednol etabonate is minimally absorbed, metabolized in the liver, and mostly eliminated as inactive metabolites.

**Mode of Action:**

Loteprednol etabonate binds to glucocorticoid receptors, modulating inflammatory gene expression. Tobramycin interferes with the 30S ribosomal subunit in susceptible bacteria, preventing protein synthesis.

**Elimination:**

Minimally absorbed loteprednol etabonate is eliminated in the bile. Any systemically absorbed tobramycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Instill one to two drops into the affected eye(s) every four to six hours. During the initial 24 to 48 hours, the dosage may be increased to one to two drops every one to two hours. The dosing frequency should be gradually tapered as the condition improves. The maximum dose is 24 drops/day.


#### **Children:**

Safety and efficacy in children have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments are not typically required.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are not typically required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustments are not typically required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with a history of herpes simplex keratitis.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosage is generally the same for the indications listed in the usage section. This medication is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, or the ICU.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are usually based on the patientâ€™s clinical response. If there's no improvement in signs and symptoms after two weeks, the treatment duration may be extended to four weeks, especially in patients with moderate to severe disease.

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Blurred vision, eye irritation, burning or stinging, foreign body sensation, ocular discharge, increased intraocular pressure, photophobia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (e.g., hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of face), glaucoma, cataracts, secondary ocular infections.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Glaucoma, cataracts, thinning of the cornea.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, significant worsening of the ocular condition, development of fungal keratitis.


## **Contraindications**

Most viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva (including epithelial herpes simplex keratitis, vaccinia, and varicella), mycobacterial ocular infections, and fungal diseases of the eye. Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication.


## **Drug Interactions**

No clinically significant drug interactions have been specifically identified.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Loteprednol etabonate + Tobramycin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. There is no information on the presence of the drugs in human milk. Caution should be exercised when administering to nursing mothers.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
