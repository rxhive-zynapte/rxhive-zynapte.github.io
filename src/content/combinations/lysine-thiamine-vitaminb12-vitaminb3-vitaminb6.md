## **Usage**

This combination is prescribed for preventing and treating deficiencies in lysine and B vitamins (thiamine (B1), B12, B3 (niacin), and B6 (pyridoxine)).  It is particularly beneficial for individuals with inadequate dietary intake, specific illnesses, alcoholism, or during pregnancy and lactation. It also supports vegetarians and vegans nutritionally.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Vitamin Supplement/Nutritional Supplement

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination provides essential B vitamins and the amino acid lysine. These nutrients are vital for various metabolic processes, including energy production, DNA/RNA synthesis, red blood cell formation, neurological function, and protein synthesis.


## **Alternate Names**

Vitamin B Complex with Lysine; Lysine-B Complex

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  B vitamins act as coenzymes in numerous metabolic pathways, including carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism.  Lysine is essential for protein synthesis, collagen formation, and calcium absorption.  

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Thiamine (B1):** Absorbed in the small intestine, metabolized in the liver, and excreted renally.
* **Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin):** Requires intrinsic factor for absorption in the ileum, stored in the liver, and excreted primarily in bile.
* **Vitamin B3 (Niacin):** Readily absorbed from the GI tract, converted to active forms (NAD, NADP) in the liver, and excreted renally.
* **Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine):** Absorbed in the jejunum, metabolized in the liver to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), its active form, and excreted renally.
* **Lysine:** Absorbed in the small intestine via active transport, metabolized in various tissues, and minimally excreted unchanged in urine.


**Mode of Action:** B vitamins function as coenzymes in various enzymatic reactions. Thiamine is vital for carbohydrate metabolism, particularly in the decarboxylation of pyruvate and alpha-ketoglutarate. Vitamin B12 is essential for DNA synthesis and red blood cell formation. Niacin, in its active forms (NAD and NADP), participates in redox reactions. Vitamin B6 is crucial for amino acid metabolism, including transamination and decarboxylation reactions.  Lysine participates in protein synthesis and various metabolic functions.



## **Dosage**

Dosage is individualized and based on daily recommended intake for each nutrient.  Consulting a doctor is crucial, especially for specific populations.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Dosage varies based on individual needs and deficiencies.  A general guideline, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is as follows (per day):
* **Thiamine (B1):** 1.2 mg (men), 1.1 mg (women)
* **Vitamin B3 (Niacin):** 16 mg NE (men), 14 mg NE (women)
* **Vitamin B6:** 1.3 mg
* **Vitamin B12:** 2.4 mcg
* **Lysine:** 1-3 grams (often used in higher doses for specific conditions, but requires medical supervision)

#### **Children:** Consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosing.

#### **Special Cases:**
* **Elderly Patients:** May require higher doses of some B vitamins due to decreased absorption.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage needs individualization.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

There isn't sufficient evidence to support specific dosing recommendations for this combination in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Modifications are necessary for renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms impacting drug metabolism.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
While generally safe, high doses of individual components may cause side effects like gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), skin flushing (niacin), and nerve damage (vitamin B6 in extremely high doses).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Allergic reactions are possible.

### **Long-Term Effects**
Long-term, excessively high doses of individual components can lead to specific complications.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
