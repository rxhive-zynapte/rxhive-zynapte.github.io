## **Usage**

Magaldrate + Oxetacaine is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of gastrointestinal discomfort related to hyperacidity, such as:

*   Dyspepsia
*   Heartburn
*   Gastritis
*   Peptic ulcers
*   Gas and bloating
*   Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
*   Abdominal pain and cramping associated with these conditions

**Pharmacological Classification:** This is a combination drug with the following classifications:

*   Magaldrate: Antacid
*   Oxetacaine: Local anesthetic

It is often combined with Simethicone, an antiflatulent.

**Mechanism of Action:** Magaldrate neutralizes excess stomach acid, increasing gastric pH. Oxetacaine provides topical anesthetic action on the gastric mucosa, relieving pain associated with ulcers or acid irritation.  Simethicone (when present) reduces surface tension of gas bubbles, facilitating their expulsion and relieving bloating.

## **Alternate Names**

Magaldrate + Oxetacaine + Simethicone; Several brand names exist depending on the manufacturer (e.g., Ulgel A, Macbate, Amalcap-O, Tekcid O,  Rantac MPS LA, Allercid Plus, Steris Antacid MSO, Sterichyme Forte,  Z-CID O, Maalox Plus, Gee-Cid, Tekcid O Sugar Free, Macbate Mint Sugar Free).

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Magaldrate increases the pH of the stomach contents by neutralizing gastric acid. Oxetacaine exerts a local anesthetic effect, numbing the gastric mucosa. Simethicone (when present) decreases the surface tension of gas bubbles in the GI tract, promoting their coalescence and easier passage.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   *Absorption:* Magaldrate is minimally absorbed systemically. Oxetacaine is absorbed locally, with limited systemic distribution. Simethicone is not absorbed and passes through the GI tract unchanged.
*   *Metabolism:* Magaldrate is not metabolized.  Limited information on oxetacaine metabolism is available. Simethicone is not metabolized.
*   *Elimination:* Magaldrate is excreted primarily in the feces. Oxetacaine's systemic elimination pathways are not well characterized. Simethicone is eliminated unchanged in the feces.

**Mode of Action:**

*   Magaldrate chemically neutralizes hydrochloric acid in the stomach.
*   Oxetacaine blocks voltage-gated sodium channels in nerve endings in the gastric mucosa, inhibiting pain signal transmission.
*   Simethicone alters the surface properties of gas bubbles, allowing them to combine.

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**  Oxetacaine blocks voltage-gated sodium channels. No receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation has been described for Magaldrate and Simethicone.


## **Dosage**

Dosage guidelines vary depending on the product formulation. Consult the manufacturer's prescribing information and a healthcare professional for personalized recommendations.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

5-10 mL (1-2 teaspoons or 1-2 tablespoons) of oral suspension, taken 20 minutes to 1 hour after meals and at bedtime, or as needed. Some formulations recommend 15-30 mL three times daily. Maximum dose: 80 mL/24 hours.


#### **Children:**

Generally not recommended for children under 12 years. For children over 12, consult a physician for appropriate dosage adjustments according to age, weight, and condition. Some sources contraindicate its use in children, as safety and efficacy have not been established.



#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution. The standard adult dose may be appropriate, but close monitoring is advised. Dose adjustments may be based on renal function and health status.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dosage reduction may be required due to potential aluminum and magnesium accumulation. 
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution as specific recommendations for dose adjustment may be needed.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage for specific clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergencies has not been specifically defined in the provided literature. General dosage recommendations should be considered, with caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  Consult a healthcare professional for specific guidance.
