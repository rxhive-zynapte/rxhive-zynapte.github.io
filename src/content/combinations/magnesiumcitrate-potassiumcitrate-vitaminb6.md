## **Usage**

- This combination is primarily prescribed for the prevention and treatment of kidney stones, particularly calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stones. It is also used to manage renal tubular acidosis, a condition where the kidneys cannot effectively remove acids from the blood, and hypocitraturia (low levels of citrate in the urine), a risk factor for kidney stone formation. Additionally, it may be used to alleviate symptoms like burning sensation during urination associated with these conditions.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Urinary alkalinizer, mineral supplement, vitamin supplement.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination works by raising the urinary pH, making it less acidic. This inhibits the crystallization and aggregation of stone-forming salts like calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate. Citrate also binds to calcium in the urine, further reducing its availability for stone formation.  Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is involved in oxalate metabolism and may help reduce oxalate levels in the urine, further preventing stone formation. Potassium citrate helps to neutralize excess acid in the blood and urine. Magnesium citrate works similarly to potassium citrate to alkalinize the urine and prevent stone formation. It also has mild laxative effects, promoting the expulsion of small stones.

## **Alternate Names**

- Potassium Magnesium Citrate + Vitamin B6
- Alkala N
- Alkaprime B6
- KMB-6
- Urikind KM6


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Magnesium citrate and potassium citrate alkalinize the urine by increasing its pH. This hinders the formation of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stones. Citrate also binds to free calcium, making it unavailable for stone formation. Vitamin B6 reduces oxalate production, another key component of some kidney stones.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** All three components are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Potassium and magnesium are primarily excreted by the kidneys, while vitamin B6 is metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine. Citrate is primarily metabolized and only a small fraction is excreted unchanged in the urine. 
- **Mode of Action:** Citrate increases urinary pH and forms complexes with calcium, inhibiting stone formation. Vitamin B6 acts as a cofactor in enzymatic pathways that reduce oxalate production. Potassium citrate neutralizes acids in the blood and urine.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for potassium and magnesium citrate, hepatic metabolism and renal excretion for vitamin B6.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The typical dosage for adults is 10-20 mL of the syrup or 2-3 tablets, one to three times daily. The dosage depends on the specific product formulation; some products might contain 1100 mg of potassium citrate, 375 mg of magnesium citrate, and 20 mg of pyridoxine hydrochloride per 5 mL dose. It is important to follow the instructions provided by the doctor or on the medication label.

#### **Children:**

- Not generally recommended for children under 12 years of age due to limited safety and efficacy data. Dosages for children 12 years and older may be adjusted according to weight and renal function under the guidance of a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary based on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Use with caution in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment; contraindicated in severe renal impairment due to the risk of hyperkalemia and hypermagnesemia.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, although specific dosage adjustments are not typically required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use cautiously in patients with cardiac conditions due to potential electrolyte imbalances. Monitor potassium levels carefully, especially in patients taking potassium-sparing diuretics or ACE inhibitors.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Dosages for specific clinical scenarios, such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations, are not standardized and should be determined on a case-by-case basis by the treating physician, considering the patient's individual needs and clinical context.
