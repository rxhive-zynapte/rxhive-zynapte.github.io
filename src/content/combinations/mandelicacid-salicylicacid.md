## **Usage**

Mandelic acid and salicylic acid are often prescribed for various skin conditions, particularly acne vulgaris (mild to moderate), photoaging, hyperpigmentation, and melasma. They are classified as keratolytic agents and belong to the alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) and beta-hydroxy acid (BHA) families, respectively.

These acids work by exfoliating the skin.  Mandelic acid breaks down the bonds between dead skin cells, promoting cell turnover and revealing healthier skin.  Salicylic acid, being lipophilic, penetrates deeper into pores to clear out sebum, dead skin cells, and debris, reducing comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) and inflammation.

## **Alternate Names**

Mandelic acid is also known as amygdalic acid or phenylglycolic acid.  Salicylic acid is sometimes referred to as 2-hydroxybenzoic acid. Brand names for products containing these acids vary widely depending on the formulation and manufacturer. Examples include SkinCeuticals' Blemish + Age Defense (salicylic) and Vivant Skin Care's 8% Mandelic Acid 3-in-1 Toner.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Mandelic acid and salicylic acid both exert their effects by promoting exfoliation of the stratum corneum (outermost skin layer).  This exfoliation unveils healthier skin, reduces hyperpigmentation, smooths fine lines and wrinkles, and helps clear acne lesions. Salicylic acid, due to its lipophilic nature, also possesses comedolytic and anti-inflammatory properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:** When applied topically, mandelic acid, due to its larger molecular size, penetrates the skin more slowly than other AHAs, such as glycolic acid, leading to less irritation. Salicylic acid, being lipophilic, penetrates the sebaceous glands and hair follicles effectively. Metabolism and elimination pathways for topically applied mandelic and salicylic acids are not fully understood, but some systemic absorption may occur, especially with higher concentrations or prolonged use on large areas.

**Mode of Action:** Both acids disrupt the cohesion of corneocytes (dead skin cells) in the stratum corneum by altering the intercellular cement. Salicylic acid's anti-inflammatory action is likely due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.  There's no known receptor binding or neurotransmitter modulation associated with their topical use for skin conditions.  Elimination is primarily through hepatic metabolism with some renal excretion.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The dosage varies greatly based on the product formulation (cream, lotion, peel, etc.) and concentration of the acids.  Generally, products containing mandelic acid for at-home use range from 5% to 10%, applied once or twice daily. Salicylic acid products are available in concentrations from 0.5% to 2% for daily use and up to 30% for peels administered by a healthcare professional.  Always follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer or healthcare professional.


#### **Children:**

Salicylic acid is generally considered safe for children in low concentrations (less than 2%), but large areas of application should be avoided.  Mandelic acid's use in children should be under the guidance of a dermatologist.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically necessary, but monitoring for irritation is advised.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No significant dosage adjustments are typically necessary for topical application, but caution is advised if large areas are being treated.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution and under the supervision of a healthcare professional.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Individualized dosing may be required based on specific comorbid conditions.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Mandelic and salicylic acids are primarily used in dermatological settings. Their use in other medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, and emergency situations is not relevant.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient tolerance and response to treatment. Start with a lower concentration and gradually increase as tolerated.




## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Mild skin irritation, redness, dryness, burning sensation, and peeling are common, particularly in the initial stages of treatment.



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe irritation, allergic reactions (e.g., contact dermatitis), blistering, or skin discoloration are rare but possible.



### **Long-Term Effects:**

Prolonged use of high concentrations, especially without proper sun protection, can increase the risk of photosensitivity and skin damage.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, though rare, necessitate immediate discontinuation of use and medical attention.



## **Contraindications**

* Known hypersensitivity to mandelic acid or salicylic acid.
* Aspirin allergy (for salicylic acid).
* Active skin infections or broken skin.



## **Drug Interactions**

Concurrent use with other topical exfoliants (e.g., retinol, other AHAs/BHAs) can increase the risk of skin irritation.  Salicylic acid may increase the absorption of some topical medications.  Concomitant use with oral retinoids should be avoided.  Some interactions may occur with certain medications like isotretinoin, tretinoin, and others.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Topical application of salicylic acid in low concentrations (up to 2%) is generally considered safe during pregnancy. However, high concentrations and oral formulations should be avoided.  Mandelic acid, due to its larger molecular size and slower absorption, is also considered relatively safe for topical use during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but it's always best to consult a doctor before using any skincare products during these periods.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Exfoliation of the stratum corneum, comedolytic and anti-inflammatory action (salicylic acid).

* **Side Effects:** Mild irritation, redness, dryness, peeling (common); severe irritation, allergic reactions (rare).

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, active skin infections, aspirin allergy (for salicylic acid).

* **Drug Interactions:**  Other topical exfoliants, oral retinoids.

* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Low concentrations of topical salicylic acid (up to 2%) and mandelic acid are generally considered safe, but consultation with a physician is recommended.

* **Dosage:**  Varies depending on formulation and concentration; follow product instructions or consult a dermatologist.

* **Monitoring Parameters:** Observe for skin irritation, allergic reactions, and effectiveness of treatment.



## **Popular Combinations**

Mandelic and salicylic acids are sometimes combined in skincare products for enhanced exfoliation and acne treatment.  Other combinations may include other AHAs or BHAs, depending on the target skin concern.



## **Precautions**

* Perform a patch test before applying to the entire affected area, especially with sensitive skin.

* Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes.

* Protect treated skin from sun exposure by using sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher.

* Discontinue use if severe irritation or allergic reaction occurs.
