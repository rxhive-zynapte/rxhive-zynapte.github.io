## **Usage**

- This vaccine is prescribed to prevent measles, mumps, and rubella (German measles). These are highly contagious viral diseases that can cause serious complications.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Vaccine (Live, attenuated viral vaccine).
- **Mechanism of Action:** This trivalent vaccine introduces weakened forms of the measles, mumps, and rubella viruses into the body.  This prompts the immune system to produce antibodies against these viruses without causing the actual diseases. The generated antibodies then protect against future infections from the wild-type viruses.

## **Alternate Names**

- MMR vaccine
- MMRV vaccine (includes varicella/chickenpox)
- **Brand Names:** M-M-R II, PRIORIX


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The vaccine stimulates an active immune response, leading to the production of specific antibodies against measles, mumps, and rubella viruses. This confers long-term immunity against these diseases.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** The vaccine is administered subcutaneously (SC) or intramuscularly (IM). The attenuated viruses replicate locally at the injection site, leading to a mild, subclinical infection.  This localized infection triggers the immune response. It is not known how the components of the vaccine are metabolized and eliminated.
- **Mode of Action:** The vaccine viruses mimic natural infection, stimulating both humoral (antibody-mediated) and cell-mediated immunity.  The activated B cells produce specific IgG antibodies against the viral antigens. 
- Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation data are not relevant for this type of vaccine.
- Elimination pathways are not relevant for this vaccine as the immune response clears the attenuated viruses.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 0.5 mL SC/IM, single dose for most adults. Two doses are recommended for certain high-risk groups like healthcare workers and international travelers with the second dose administered at least 28 days after the first. Adults born before 1957 are generally considered immune.

#### **Children:**

- 0.5 mL SC/IM.  First dose at 12-15 months of age. Second dose at 4-6 years of age (can be given earlier, minimum 28 days after the first dose). For international travel, the first dose can be administered as early as 6 months. If given before 12 months, it does not count towards the two-dose series.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Single dose is generally sufficient unless they belong to a high-risk group.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically needed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised in immunocompromised individuals. They should not receive the live attenuated vaccine.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The MMR vaccine is not typically used in acute clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It's a preventive vaccine, not a treatment.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific dosage adjustments are recommended based on renal/hepatic function or other metabolic disorders.  However, the vaccine is contraindicated in immunocompromised individuals.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

- Mild fever
- Injection site soreness, redness, swelling
- Mild rash


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
- Seizure (febrile)
- Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)


### **Long-Term Effects:**

No significant long-term adverse effects have been associated with the MMR vaccine.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any severe allergic reaction or neurological symptoms should be treated as a medical emergency.



## **Contraindications**

- Severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of MMR vaccine or any of its components (gelatin, neomycin).
- Pregnancy.
- Severe immunodeficiency (e.g., congenital immunodeficiency, leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, or therapy with alkylating agents, antimetabolites, radiation, or large doses of corticosteroids).



## **Drug Interactions**

- Recent blood transfusion or administration of immune globulin may interfere with the immune response to MMR vaccine.
- Concomitant administration with other live attenuated vaccines should be separated by at least 4 weeks.
- Immunosuppressive drugs may reduce the immune response.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Contraindicated. MMR vaccine should not be given to pregnant women. Pregnancy should be avoided for 4 weeks after vaccination.
- **Breastfeeding:** Generally considered safe. The attenuated viruses are not likely to be transmitted through breast milk.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Induces active immunity against measles, mumps, and rubella viruses.
- **Side Effects:**  Generally mild and transient; may include fever, injection site reactions, and mild rash. Rare serious side effects include allergic reactions and febrile seizures.
- **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, severe immunodeficiency, hypersensitivity to vaccine components.
- **Drug Interactions:** Immune globulin, blood transfusions, immunosuppressive therapy.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy; generally safe during breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** 0.5 mL SC/IM; two doses for children, single dose for most adults.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for any signs of allergic reaction or other serious adverse effects.

## **Popular Combinations**

MMRV (Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella) vaccine combines the MMR with the varicella vaccine. This combination is convenient for childhood vaccinations.

## **Precautions**

- Screen for contraindications and allergies before administering.
- **Pregnant Women:**  Avoid pregnancy for at least 4 weeks after vaccination.
- **Breastfeeding Mothers:**  No special precautions needed.
- **Children & Elderly:**  Follow standard dosing guidelines.
- Defer vaccination in individuals with moderate or severe acute illness.
