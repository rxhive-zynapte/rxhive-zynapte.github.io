## **Usage**

- This combined vaccine is prescribed to provide immunity against measles and rubella (German measles).  These are highly contagious viral diseases that can cause serious complications.  The vaccine is a key component of childhood immunization schedules worldwide.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Vaccine (Live, Attenuated Viral Vaccine).
- **Mechanism of action:** The vaccine introduces weakened forms of the measles and rubella viruses into the body. This stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies against these viruses, leading to long-lasting immunity. The weakened viruses are unable to cause the diseases in healthy individuals but are strong enough to trigger an immune response.

## **Alternate Names**

- MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) vaccine is often administered as a combined vaccine, also including protection against mumps.
- **Brand Names:** M-M-R II, PRIORIX, MMRV (includes varicella/chickenpox).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The vaccine generates a primary immune response upon first administration and a boosted secondary response with subsequent doses, strengthening immunity. The antibodies produced specifically target measles and rubella viruses, neutralizing them upon future exposure and preventing infection.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** The vaccine is administered subcutaneously. The attenuated viruses replicate locally at the injection site and stimulate the immune system. The specific pharmacokinetic properties of the weakened viruses are not clinically significant as they do not cause active infection in immunocompetent individuals. Elimination occurs through the normal immune processes.
- **Mode of Action:** The vaccine mimics natural infection without causing the diseases. The attenuated viruses are recognized as foreign by antigen-presenting cells, which trigger the activation of B cells and T cells. This process results in antibody production and cell-mediated immunity against measles and rubella viruses.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Not applicable for vaccines.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Elimination of the vaccine components occurs primarily via immune clearance as the attenuated viruses are targeted and destroyed by the immune system.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Born before 1957:** Generally considered immune to measles and rubella due to likely natural exposure.
- **Born 1957 or later:** One or two doses depending on indication (e.g., healthcare workers require two). Certain professions or situations may require documentation of immunity or two doses of MMR.

#### **Children:**

- Two doses are recommended, typically administered at 12–15 months of age for the first dose and 4–6 years of age for the second.
- The second dose can be administered earlier (minimum 28 days after the first dose) if the child remains in an area with high disease risk.
- **Pediatric Safety Considerations:**  The vaccine is generally safe for children. Minor side effects like fever or rash are common.  Severe allergic reactions are rare.

#### **Special Cases**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Dosing is typically the same as adults.
- **Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment:** No dose adjustments are typically necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consult recommendations; generally safe for most comorbid conditions.
- **Immunocompromised Individuals:**  Live attenuated vaccines are generally contraindicated in severely immunocompromised individuals.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations:**  The MMR vaccine is not relevant in these acute care settings.  It is a preventative measure, not a treatment.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- No dose adjustments are typically needed based on renal/hepatic function.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Mild fever
- Rash
- Soreness at injection site
- Swelling of glands in the cheeks or neck

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Seizure (often associated with fever)
- Serious allergic reaction

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Long-lasting immunity against measles and rubella.  No significant long-term adverse effects associated with the MMR vaccine.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Anaphylaxis (rare)

## **Contraindications**

- Severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of MMR vaccine or any component of the vaccine (e.g., neomycin).
- Pregnancy
- Severe immunodeficiency (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, AIDS)

## **Drug Interactions**

- Recently administered blood products (may interfere with immune response)
- Immunosuppressive medications (may reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine)

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Contraindicated.  MMR should not be given to pregnant women.  Pregnancy should be avoided for at least one month following vaccination.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Generally considered safe; the attenuated viruses are not transmitted through breast milk.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Induces immunity against measles and rubella by stimulating antibody production.
- **Side Effects:** Commonly mild fever, rash, injection site soreness. Rarely seizures or serious allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, severe immunodeficiency, prior severe allergic reaction to MMR.
- **Drug Interactions:**  Recent blood products, immunosuppressants.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy, generally safe during breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** Two doses in childhood; one or two doses for adults depending on indication.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** No specific monitoring parameters are typically needed.


## **Popular Combinations**

- The MMR vaccine is often combined with the varicella vaccine (MMRV) to provide protection against chickenpox.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Screen for contraindications and prior allergic reactions.
- **Specific Populations:** Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication. Caution in immunocompromised individuals.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:**  No specific lifestyle considerations.
