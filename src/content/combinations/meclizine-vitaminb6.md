## **Usage**

Meclizine + Vitamin B6 is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness associated with motion sickness. It is also used to manage vertigo associated with inner ear problems (e.g., Meniere's disease, labyrinthitis). Additionally, it may be used to alleviate nausea and vomiting in pregnant women (morning sickness).

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antiemetic, Antihistamine (Meclizine), Vitamin (B6)

**Mechanism of Action:** Meclizine acts as an antihistamine by blocking H1 receptors in the vestibular system of the inner ear and the vomiting center in the brain, thus reducing the sensation of motion sickness and nausea. Vitamin B6 is believed to contribute to the antiemetic effect, possibly by modulating neurotransmitter pathways involved in nausea and vomiting.

## **Alternate Names**

Meclizine is also known as Meclozine. Vitamin B6 is also known as Pyridoxine.  There are various international and regional variations, but no other widely used generic name.

**Brand Names:**  Examples include Bonine (for Meclizine alone), Vominore, Navidoxine, Vertina Plus, Dovas, and Vomidoxine-B6.  Brand names may vary by region.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Meclizine primarily affects the central nervous system by inhibiting histamine activity in the areas responsible for motion sickness and balance.  It has anticholinergic properties, which means it blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in various bodily functions.  Vitamin B6 is crucial in many metabolic processes, including neurotransmitter synthesis and function. Its antiemetic mechanism is not fully understood but might involve modulation of serotonin and dopamine pathways.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Meclizine is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations in approximately 2 to 3 hours. It's extensively metabolized in the liver and eliminated primarily through the kidneys. Vitamin B6 is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and converted into its active forms, pyridoxal phosphate and pyridoxamine phosphate, in the liver. Excess vitamin B6 is excreted in the urine.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Meclizine binds to and blocks H1 histamine receptors.  Vitamin B6 acts as a coenzyme for numerous enzymes involved in amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism.

**Elimination Pathways:** Meclizine is primarily excreted via renal elimination after hepatic metabolism. Vitamin B6 and its metabolites are excreted in the urine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Motion Sickness:** 25-50 mg orally, 1 hour before travel.  May repeat every 24 hours as needed.
* **Vertigo:** 25-100 mg orally daily, in divided doses.

#### **Children:**

* **Motion Sickness (6-12 years):** 12.5-25 mg orally, 1 hour before travel. May repeat every 24 hours as needed.
* **Vertigo:** Use and dose must be determined by a doctor.
* **Children under 6:** Meclizine is generally not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lowest dose and titrate up as needed, as elderly patients are more susceptible to anticholinergic side effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution, dose adjustment may be necessary due to potential drug accumulation.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution, dose adjustment may be necessary due to altered metabolism.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions (e.g., asthma, glaucoma, enlarged prostate):** Use with caution, as Meclizine's anticholinergic effects may worsen these conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  The combination of meclizine and vitamin B6 is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Other medications are preferred in these situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be required based on individual patient factors such as age, weight, renal function, hepatic function, and coexisting medical conditions. Always follow a doctor's recommendations for dosage.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Drowsiness
* Dry mouth
* Fatigue
* Headache


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Severe dizziness or fainting

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term effects are not typically associated with short-term use for motion sickness or vertigo.  Prolonged use of high doses of vitamin B6 can lead to peripheral neuropathy.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions require immediate medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to Meclizine or Vitamin B6
* Hepatic impairment (severe)
* Patients with certain pre-existing conditions (e.g., glaucoma, asthma, enlarged prostate) should use with caution.


## **Drug Interactions**

* Alcohol and other CNS depressants (e.g., sedatives, tranquilizers): May enhance drowsiness and sedative effects.
* Anticholinergic drugs: May increase anticholinergic side effects.
* MAO inhibitors:  Concurrent use should be avoided.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Meclizine is considered relatively safe for use during pregnancy, especially for managing morning sickness. However, it should be used only when clearly needed and under medical supervision.
* **Breastfeeding:** There is limited data on Meclizine excretion in breast milk.  Caution is advised, and the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the infant.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Meclizine blocks H1 receptors; Vitamin B6 likely modulates neurotransmitter pathways.
* **Side Effects:** Drowsiness, dry mouth, fatigue, allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe hepatic impairment.  Use with caution in certain medical conditions.
* **Drug Interactions:** CNS depressants, anticholinergic drugs, MAO inhibitors.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Relatively safe during pregnancy (under supervision); caution advised during breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:**  See Dosage section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Observe for adverse reactions, especially in elderly patients and those with renal/hepatic impairment.


## **Popular Combinations**

Meclizine is sometimes combined with Vitamin B6 to enhance its antiemetic effect. However, Meclizine alone is often effective.



## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess for allergies and pre-existing medical conditions.
* **Specific Populations:** See Dosage section above.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Avoid alcohol and activities requiring alertness while taking Meclizine.
