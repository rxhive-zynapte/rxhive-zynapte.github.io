## **Usage**

Meloxicam + Paracetamol is a combination medication primarily prescribed for the relief of pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.  It combines the analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties of both drugs for synergistic pain management.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Meloxicam: Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID), Analgesic, Antipyretic
* Paracetamol: Analgesic, Antipyretic

**Mechanism of Action:**

Meloxicam preferentially inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, which mediates inflammation and pain.  Paracetamol's exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it is believed to inhibit COX enzymes in the central nervous system, affecting pain and temperature regulation.

## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names for the combination exist. Individually, they may be known as:

* **Meloxicam:** Mobic, Vivlodex, others (brand names vary by region)
* **Paracetamol:** Acetaminophen (primarily in the United States and Canada)

Brand names for the combination product vary by region.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Meloxicam reduces inflammation and pain by decreasing prostaglandin production. Paracetamol primarily affects the central nervous system, reducing pain and fever.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Meloxicam:** Well-absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, primarily excreted renally.
* **Paracetamol:** Rapidly absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, excreted renally.

**Mode of Action:**  Meloxicam preferentially binds to and inhibits COX-2 enzyme, reducing prostaglandin synthesis. Paracetamol's mechanism is not completely elucidated but involves central COX inhibition and possible effects on endocannabinoid and serotonergic pathways.

**Elimination Pathways:** Both drugs are primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

A common dosage is 7.5 mg meloxicam and 500 mg paracetamol, taken once or twice daily.  The maximum recommended daily dose of meloxicam is 15 mg, and paracetamol should not exceed 4000 mg daily.

#### **Children:**

Meloxicam is sometimes prescribed for children 2 years and older for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The dosage is weight-based and should be determined by a pediatrician.  Paracetamol dosing for children is also weight-based.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and monitor closely due to increased risk of side effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary depending on the severity of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment may be required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful evaluation and monitoring are necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.  These cases typically require parenteral analgesics and other interventions.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are needed based on patient-specific factors such as renal/hepatic function, age, and other medications.  Close monitoring for side effects is essential, especially in elderly or compromised patients.

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain), headache, dizziness, fluid retention, skin rash, itching.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke), allergic reactions, liver damage, kidney problems.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic kidney disease, gastrointestinal problems, cardiovascular complications.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to either drug, severe renal or hepatic impairment, history of gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers, active peptic ulcer disease, pregnancy (especially third trimester), breastfeeding (meloxicam is contraindicated). Aspirin triad (asthma, nasal polyps, aspirin sensitivity).

## **Drug Interactions**

Other NSAIDs, anticoagulants (warfarin), antiplatelet agents (aspirin), corticosteroids, lithium, methotrexate, some antihypertensives (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, diuretics), alcohol.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Meloxicam is contraindicated during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester. It is also contraindicated during breastfeeding. Paracetamol is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding at recommended doses.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Meloxicam inhibits COX-2, reducing prostaglandins. Paracetamol's mechanism is complex, likely involving central COX inhibition.
* **Side Effects:** GI upset, headache, dizziness.  Serious effects: GI bleeding, cardiovascular events, liver/kidney damage.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe renal/hepatic impairment, GI bleeding, pregnancy (meloxicam), breastfeeding (meloxicam).
* **Drug Interactions:** NSAIDs, anticoagulants, antiplatelets, lithium, methotrexate, some antihypertensives, alcohol.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Meloxicam contraindicated. Paracetamol generally safe at recommended doses.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 7.5mg meloxicam + 500mg paracetamol, 1-2 times/day (max 15mg meloxicam and 4000mg paracetamol daily). Pediatric and other adjustments needed.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Renal and liver function, blood pressure, signs of GI bleeding.

## **Popular Combinations**

While meloxicam and paracetamol are combined, each can also be used with other agents, such as opioids for more severe pain or gastroprotective agents.



## **Precautions**

Screen for allergies, assess renal and hepatic function, cardiovascular risk, and history of GI issues.  Avoid in pregnancy (meloxicam) and breastfeeding (meloxicam). Caution in elderly.  Advise patients to limit alcohol intake.
