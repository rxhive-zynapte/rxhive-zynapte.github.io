      What is the recommended dosage for Metamizole + Nimesulide?**


      **A:**  The combination is not a standardized regimen with a fixed dosage.
      Doses are individualized. Metamizole is typically administered at 500-1000
      mg every 6-8 hours up to 4000 mg/day, and Nimesulide at 100 mg twice
      daily, max 200 mg/day.  The combined use requires careful consideration
      and is often not recommended due to overlapping side effects and potential
      for increased toxicity.

## **Usage**

This combination is typically prescribed for short-term management of acute pain, especially when inflammation is a significant component.  Metamizole is an analgesic and antipyretic, while Nimesulide is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Analgesic, Antipyretic, Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Metamizole inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, primarily in the central nervous system, thus reducing prostaglandin synthesis and alleviating pain and fever. Nimesulide preferentially inhibits COX-2, leading to reduced inflammation and pain.

## **Alternate Names**

- **Metamizole:** Dipyrone, Analgin, Novalgin, Algocalmin, Sulpyrine.
- **Nimesulide:** Nimed, Mesulid, Aulin.
- **Combination:**  While the combination itself doesn't have a unique international non-proprietary name (INN), it may be marketed under various brand names. Brand names may vary depending on the region.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Metamizole acts centrally to reduce pain and fever. Nimesulide exerts peripheral anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. The combination provides broader pain relief targeting both central and peripheral mechanisms.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Both drugs are well-absorbed orally. Metamizole is rapidly metabolized to its active metabolite, 4-methylaminoantipyrine (MAA). Nimesulide is metabolized in the liver. Both drugs are primarily eliminated via renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** Metamizole's analgesic mechanism is not fully elucidated but involves COX inhibition and potentially other pathways. Nimesulide's primary mechanism is COX-2 inhibition.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Metamizole inhibits COX enzymes, mainly centrally. Nimesulide preferentially inhibits COX-2.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Both drugs are primarily excreted through the kidneys, with some hepatic metabolism.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Metamizole: 500-1000 mg every 6-8 hours, up to a maximum of 4000 mg/day.
Nimesulide: 100 mg twice daily after meals, up to a maximum of 200mg/day.

#### **Children:**

This combination is generally not recommended for children under 12 years of age.  Pediatric dosing should be carefully evaluated by a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary due to age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.  Start with lower doses and titrate as needed.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction of both metamizole and nimesulide is recommended in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.  Nimesulide is contraindicated in severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction of both metamizole and nimesulide is recommended in patients with hepatic impairment. Nimesulide is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal disorders, or bleeding tendencies.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination isn't typically employed in specialized clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU. Its primary use is for short-term pain management.  For specific settings, individualized analgesic strategies are recommended.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary for elderly patients, and patients with renal or hepatic impairments. Close monitoring of liver and kidney function is essential.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)
- Dizziness
- Headache
- Drowsiness
- Rash

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Agranulocytosis (Metamizole)
- Aplastic anemia (Metamizole)
- Hepatotoxicity (Nimesulide)
- Stevens-Johnson syndrome (Metamizole)
- Anaphylaxis (Metamizole)


### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term use of Nimesulide is associated with increased risks of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal complications. Long-term use of metamizole is associated with blood disorders. The combination is not recommended for long-term use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, hepatotoxicity, and severe hypersensitivity reactions are serious ADRs requiring immediate discontinuation and medical intervention.
