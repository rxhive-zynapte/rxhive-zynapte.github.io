## **Usage**

- This triple combination therapy is prescribed for **type 2 diabetes mellitus**, specifically in adults whose blood sugar levels are inadequately controlled by diet, exercise, and other antidiabetic medications, either alone or in combination.  It may be used as a second-line treatment following insufficient glycemic control with lifestyle changes and single antidiabetic drugs.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antidiabetic combination therapy comprising a biguanide (Metformin), a thiazolidinedione (Pioglitazone), and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor (Teneligliptin).
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination targets multiple pathways involved in glucose regulation. Metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and enhances insulin sensitivity, Pioglitazone increases insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, and Teneligliptin increases incretin levels which stimulate insulin secretion and decrease glucagon release.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate generic names exist for this specific triple combination.
- Several brand names may exist depending on the manufacturer and region. Examples include Teneligold-PM 500. It is crucial to confirm the active ingredients listed on the packaging.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**
    - Metformin: Reduces hepatic glucose production, improves peripheral insulin sensitivity, and decreases intestinal glucose absorption.
    - Pioglitazone: Acts as a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) agonist, increasing insulin sensitivity in liver, muscle, and adipose tissue.
    - Teneligliptin: Inhibits DPP-4, the enzyme that degrades incretin hormones. This increases levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), leading to enhanced glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppressed glucagon release.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Metformin: Absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, not metabolized, and excreted renally.
    - Pioglitazone: Extensively metabolized by the liver (primarily CYP2C8 and CYP3A4) and excreted in bile and urine.
    - Teneligliptin: Rapidly absorbed, partially metabolized, and eliminated through both renal and hepatic routes.

- **Mode of Action:**
    - Metformin: Although the exact mechanism remains unclear, it is thought to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), leading to decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis.
    - Pioglitazone: PPAR-γ activation modulates gene expression, enhancing insulin signaling and glucose uptake.
    - Teneligliptin: By preventing DPP-4-mediated degradation of incretins, it enhances the incretin effect, promoting insulin secretion and lowering glucagon levels.

- **Elimination Pathways:**
    - Metformin: Renal excretion.
    - Pioglitazone: Hepatic metabolism (CYP2C8, CYP3A4) followed by biliary and urinary excretion.
    - Teneligliptin: Both renal and hepatic elimination.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: Metformin 500mg + Pioglitazone 15mg + Teneligliptin 20mg once daily with food.
- Dosage can be titrated up based on efficacy and tolerability, up to a maximum of Metformin 2000mg + Pioglitazone 45mg + Teneligliptin 40mg per day. Individual components may be adjusted separately based on patient response and tolerability.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for patients under 18 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Close monitoring of renal function and dose adjustment as needed.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Contraindicated in moderate to severe renal impairment (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²). Dose reduction may be required for mild renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution due to the risk of Pioglitazone-induced liver toxicity. Liver function tests should be monitored regularly.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use cautiously in heart failure, as Pioglitazone can cause fluid retention and exacerbate symptoms. Consider specific drug interactions and adjust doses accordingly.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- This combination is not specifically indicated for use in intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments should be individualized based on patient response, renal/hepatic function, and other relevant factors.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
- Headache
- Upper respiratory tract infection
- Hypoglycemia (especially when combined with other antidiabetic agents)
- Weight gain (primarily due to Pioglitazone)


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Lactic acidosis (Metformin)
- Liver dysfunction (Pioglitazone)
- Fluid retention and edema (Pioglitazone)
- Bladder cancer (Pioglitazone)
- Fractures (Pioglitazone)
- Pancreatitis



### **Long-Term Effects**

- Potential for chronic complications such as worsening of renal or hepatic function, development of cardiovascular complications, and increased risk of bladder cancer with long-term Pioglitazone use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Lactic acidosis, severe hypoglycemia, angioedema, and symptomatic hepatotoxicity.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any component of the combination
- Type 1 diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis
- Severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²)
- Acute conditions affecting renal function
- History of bladder cancer, uninvestigated macroscopic hematuria
- Active or history of heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV)

## **Drug Interactions**

- Drugs that affect glucose control (e.g., corticosteroids, thiazide diuretics)
- CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) and inducers (e.g., rifampin) may alter Pioglitazone metabolism
- Alcohol may increase the risk of lactic acidosis with Metformin and may affect glucose control.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Not recommended for use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Teneligliptin and Pioglitazone can be excreted in breastmilk and may have unknown effects on the fetus or neonate.  Metformin is generally considered safe during pregnancy but should be used with caution.

## **Drug Profile Summary**
