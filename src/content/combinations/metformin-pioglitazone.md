      How should I adjust the dose in patients with renal impairment?**


      **A:**  The drug is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR <30
      mL/min/1.73m². It's not recommended to initiate treatment in patients with
      eGFR between 30-45 mL/min/1.73m². For those already on therapy,
      re-evaluate the risks and benefits if the eGFR falls below 45
      mL/min/1.73m² and discontinue if it falls below 30 mL/min/1.73m².

      What should I do if a patient develops heart failure while on this
      medication?**


      **A:** Consider discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone, as it
      can contribute to fluid retention. Evaluate the patient's heart failure
      status and optimize treatment as needed.

      How does this medication interact with gemfibrozil?**


      **A:** Gemfibrozil inhibits CYP2C8, which metabolizes pioglitazone.  This
      can lead to increased pioglitazone levels.  When co-administering with
      gemfibrozil, the maximum dose of Metformin + Pioglitazone should be
      limited to 15 mg/850 mg once daily.

## **Usage**

Metformin + Pioglitazone is prescribed for type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults, specifically when diet and exercise alone or treatment with either metformin or pioglitazone alone do not provide adequate glycemic control.  It is also used for patients switching from combination therapy of metformin and pioglitazone as separate tablets. It belongs to the pharmacological class of antidiabetic agents, combining a biguanide (metformin) and a thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone). The combination works by improving insulin sensitivity, reducing hepatic glucose production, and decreasing intestinal glucose absorption.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is commonly known as metformin-pioglitazone. A popular brand name under which it is marketed is Actoplus Met.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Metformin primarily decreases hepatic glucose production and improves insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues (muscle, liver, and fat). Pioglitazone primarily increases insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ). This leads to improved glucose uptake and utilization.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Both drugs are orally administered and absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Food may slightly delay metformin absorption.
* **Metabolism:** Metformin is not metabolized in the liver. Pioglitazone is extensively metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4.
* **Elimination:** Metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine. Pioglitazone's metabolites are primarily excreted in the bile and feces, with a small amount excreted in the urine.


**Mode of Action:**  Metformin's exact mechanism is unclear, but it involves activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which leads to a reduction in hepatic gluconeogenesis. Pioglitazone acts as a PPAR-γ agonist, modulating the transcription of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Pioglitazone binds to and activates PPAR-γ receptors. Metformin does not bind to receptors but acts through AMPK activation. Neither drug significantly inhibits enzymes or modulates neurotransmitters related to their primary antidiabetic effects.

**Elimination Pathways:** Metformin is renally excreted, while pioglitazone undergoes hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The starting dose varies depending on the patient's current treatment. 

* **Patients not treated with either drug:** 500 mg metformin/15 mg pioglitazone twice daily or 850 mg metformin/15 mg pioglitazone once daily with meals.
* **Patients on metformin monotherapy:** Choose a dose closest to the current metformin dose with the addition of 15-30 mg pioglitazone daily. 
* **Patients on pioglitazone monotherapy:** Choose a dose closest to the current pioglitazone dose with the addition of 1000-1700 mg metformin daily. 
* **Patients switching from combination therapy:** Select a dosage closest to their current dosages.

The maximum dose is 45 mg pioglitazone/2550 mg metformin per day (immediate-release tablets) or 45 mg pioglitazone/2000 mg metformin per day (extended-release tablets).


#### **Children:**

Use and dose must be determined by a doctor.


#### **Special Cases:**


* **Elderly Patients:** Renal function should be monitored regularly. Start with the lowest dose and titrate cautiously.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Contraindicated in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m². Not recommended to initiate in patients with eGFR 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m².
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Do not administer if baseline ALT ≥2.5 x ULN. Use caution if baseline ALT <2.5 x ULN. Discontinue if ALT >3 x ULN or jaundice develops after initiation.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions (e.g., Heart Failure):** Initiate with a lower dose (e.g., 15 mg pioglitazone/500 mg metformin) and monitor for fluid retention.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Metformin + Pioglitazone is not indicated for use in acute settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary based on patient-specific factors, including renal/hepatic dysfunction, heart failure, and concomitant medications.  For example, co-administration with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) requires a dose reduction to a maximum of 15 mg pioglitazone/850 mg metformin daily.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Headache, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, weakness, sore throat, muscle pain, weight gain, tooth problems, metallic taste in the mouth, upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., runny nose, cough).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Lactic acidosis (with metformin), heart failure (with pioglitazone), hypoglycemia, liver dysfunction (with pioglitazone), bladder cancer (with pioglitazone), macular edema (with pioglitazone), bone fractures (with pioglitazone).

### **Long-Term Effects**

Weight gain, anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency (with metformin).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions (e.g., hives, angioedema, difficulty breathing), severe hypoglycemia, acute heart failure exacerbations, lactic acidosis.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to either component; severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²); acute or chronic metabolic acidosis (including diabetic ketoacidosis); history of lactic acidosis; hepatic impairment (ALT ≥2.5 x ULN);  active bladder cancer; history of bladder cancer; uninvestigated macroscopic hematuria; type 1 diabetes.


## **Drug Interactions**

Clinically significant interactions can occur with drugs that affect metformin clearance (e.g., ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, cimetidine), CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) and inducers (e.g., rifampin), carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, insulin secretagogues, and insulin. Alcohol can increase the risk of lactic acidosis with metformin.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Metformin + Pioglitazone is not recommended during pregnancy and is contraindicated during breastfeeding.  Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy poses risks to both the mother and fetus.  Safer alternatives should be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production and improves insulin sensitivity. Pioglitazone increases insulin sensitivity via PPAR-γ activation.
* **Side Effects:** Common:  Gastrointestinal upset, headache, upper respiratory tract infection. Serious: Lactic acidosis, heart failure, hypoglycemia, liver dysfunction, bladder cancer.
* **Contraindications:**  Renal impairment, hepatic impairment, type 1 diabetes, bladder cancer.
* **Drug Interactions:** CYP2C8 inhibitors/inducers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, some cationic drugs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Not recommended during pregnancy, contraindicated during breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** Varies depending on prior therapy. Max: 45 mg pioglitazone/2550 mg metformin (immediate-release), 45 mg pioglitazone/2000 mg metformin (extended-release).
