## **Usage**

- This triple combination therapy is prescribed for **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus** in adults when diet, exercise, and dual therapies (e.g., Metformin + Repaglinide or Metformin + Voglibose) are inadequate for achieving glycemic control.  It is particularly beneficial in managing **postprandial hyperglycemia** (high blood sugar after meals).
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antidiabetic agent - comprised of a biguanide (Metformin), a meglitinide (Repaglinide), and an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor (Voglibose).
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination works through three distinct mechanisms:
    - **Metformin:** Reduces hepatic glucose production, enhances insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, and diminishes intestinal glucose absorption.
    - **Repaglinide:** Stimulates insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells, primarily acting on postprandial glucose excursions.
    - **Voglibose:** Delays carbohydrate digestion and absorption in the small intestine, thereby blunting postprandial glucose spikes.

## **Alternate Names**

- No specific alternate names exist for the triple combination itself. The individual components have their own generic and brand names.
- **Brand Names:** Vogli Rapid M (Medley Pharmaceuticals). Other brand names may exist depending upon the manufacturer and region.  The individual drugs are marketed under various brand names like Glucophage for Metformin, Prandin for Repaglinide, and Volix/Basen for Voglibose.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  The combination exerts its glucose-lowering effect through the combined actions of its components: reducing hepatic glucose output (Metformin), increasing insulin release (Repaglinide), and delaying intestinal carbohydrate absorption (Voglibose).  This leads to a reduction in both fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels, improving overall glycemic control.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Metformin:**  Absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, not metabolized, and excreted renally.
    - **Repaglinide:** Rapidly absorbed, extensively metabolized by CYP450 enzymes (primarily CYP2C8 and CYP3A4), and excreted mainly through the biliary route.
    - **Voglibose:**  Minimally absorbed from the GI tract, metabolized by intestinal bacteria, and excreted primarily in feces.
- **Mode of Action:**
    - **Metformin:**  Increases AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, leading to a cascade of effects that reduce gluconeogenesis, increase glucose uptake, and improve insulin signaling.
    - **Repaglinide:** Binds to and closes ATP-sensitive potassium channels on pancreatic beta-cells, depolarizing the cell membrane and triggering insulin release via calcium influx.
    - **Voglibose:**  Competitively inhibits alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the brush border of the small intestine, hindering the breakdown of complex carbohydrates into absorbable monosaccharides.
- **Elimination Pathways:**
    - **Metformin:** Renal excretion.
    - **Repaglinide:** Primarily biliary/fecal excretion, with a small amount of renal excretion.
    - **Voglibose:** Primarily fecal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Dosage is individualized based on patient response, blood glucose monitoring, and tolerability.
- Typical starting regimen: Metformin 500mg, Repaglinide 0.5mg, and Voglibose 0.2mg before main meals.
- Titration: The dose of each component may be gradually increased, typically under close medical supervision, up to a maximum daily dose for each drug.
- Timing: Administered with or shortly before main meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner)

#### **Children:** This combination is *not* recommended for pediatric use.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate therapy with lower doses and titrate cautiously.  Renal function should be carefully assessed.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Metformin is contraindicated in severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²).  Dose adjustments or avoidance of Metformin might be necessary in moderate to severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Repaglinide is contraindicated in moderate to severe hepatic impairment. Metformin should generally be avoided in severe liver disease due to the risk of lactic acidosis. Voglibose dosage may require adjustment in hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration is required for patients with cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal disorders, or other relevant conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is generally *not* used in acute medical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU care, or emergency situations. Its use is for chronic management of type 2 diabetes.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose modifications are based on renal function, hepatic function, patient age, other medications, and individual glycemic response.
- Regular monitoring of blood glucose, HbA1c, and renal function is essential.

## **Side Effects**

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Lactic acidosis (Metformin)
- Severe hypoglycemia
- Hepatic dysfunction
- Allergic reactions

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Vitamin B12 deficiency (Metformin)

- Conditions predisposing to lactic acidosis (e.g., heart failure, respiratory insufficiency, sepsis)
- Hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation

## **Drug Interactions**

- **Repaglinide:** Interacts with CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) and CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors.
- **Metformin:**  Interacts with cationic drugs eliminated by renal tubular secretion.
- **Alcohol:** Increases risk of lactic acidosis (Metformin) and hypoglycemia.
- **Beta-blockers:** Can mask symptoms of hypoglycemia.
- Other antidiabetic medications: Additive effects on blood glucose lowering.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Metformin is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
- Repaglinide and Voglibose safety data in pregnancy and breastfeeding is limited, these should be avoided during pregnancy.
- Insulin is typically the preferred agent for managing diabetes during pregnancy. If breastfeeding while on Voglibose + Metformin, monitor infant for adverse reactions.
