## **Usage**

- Metformin + Sitagliptin is prescribed for type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults. It is used as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control when metformin alone or sitagliptin alone does not provide adequate glycemic control.  It is not indicated for type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antidiabetic combination;  Biguanide (Metformin) and Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor (Sitagliptin).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production and intestinal glucose absorption and improves insulin sensitivity. Sitagliptin increases incretin levels, which in turn increase insulin secretion and decrease glucagon secretion.

## **Alternate Names**

- Sitagliptin Phosphate/Metformin Hydrochloride
- **Brand Names:** Janumet, Janumet XR, Zituvimet, Zituvimet XR


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Metformin reduces hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity (peripheral glucose uptake and utilization). Sitagliptin inhibits the DPP-4 enzyme, which prolongs the action of incretin hormones (like GLP-1 and GIP). These hormones increase insulin release and suppress glucagon secretion, particularly after meals.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Metformin:**  Absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, not metabolized, and excreted primarily by the kidneys.
    - **Sitagliptin:** Absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 with minor contribution by CYP2C8, and eliminated primarily through renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** Metformin's precise mechanism is not fully understood, but it involves activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Sitagliptin's mode of action involves competitive and reversible inhibition of DPP-4, preventing the inactivation of incretin hormones.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Metformin activates AMPK. Sitagliptin inhibits DPP-4.
- **Elimination pathways:** Metformin is renally excreted. Sitagliptin undergoes some hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4 (primarily) and CYP2C8 (minor), with primarily renal elimination of the parent compound and metabolites.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Immediate-release:**  
    - For patients not currently on Metformin: Initial dose is 50 mg Sitagliptin/500 mg Metformin twice daily.
    - For patients currently on Metformin: Initial dose is 50 mg Sitagliptin twice daily plus the current Metformin dose.  For patients already taking 850 mg Metformin twice daily, the starting dose is 50 mg Sitagliptin/1000 mg Metformin twice daily.
- **Extended-release:**
    - For patients not currently on Metformin: Initial dose is 100 mg Sitagliptin/1000 mg Metformin once daily.
    - For patients currently on Metformin: Initial dose is 100 mg Sitagliptin once daily plus the current Metformin dose. For patients currently on 850 mg or 1000 mg Metformin twice daily, initial dose is 100 mg Sitagliptin/1000 mg Metformin HCl once daily.
- The maximum daily dose is 100 mg Sitagliptin and 2000 mg Metformin.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for use in children under 18.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Dose adjustment may be required based on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; contraindicated in patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m². Dose reduction is required for moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30-45 mL/min/1.73 m²).
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Not recommended.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in CHF patients and those at risk of lactic acidosis.



### **Clinical Use Cases**  The listed clinical scenarios are generally not applicable for the use of Metformin + Sitagliptin.  This medication is used for the long-term management of type 2 diabetes. The use in emergency or acute care situations is not relevant.

### **Dosage Adjustments**  Dosage adjustments are based on renal function, as described in the Special Cases section.
