## **Usage**

This triple combination therapy is prescribed for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults when control cannot be achieved with other dual therapies like Metformin with either Teneligliptin or Voglibose.  It combines three different oral antidiabetic agents with complementary mechanisms of action.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Oral antidiabetic combination, comprising a biguanide (Metformin), a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor (Teneligliptin), and an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor (Voglibose).

- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination targets multiple pathways involved in glucose regulation. Metformin reduces hepatic glucose production, enhances insulin sensitivity, and decreases intestinal glucose absorption.  Teneligliptin prolongs the action of incretin hormones, which stimulate insulin release and suppress glucagon secretion. Voglibose delays the intestinal absorption of carbohydrates.

## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination. However, the individual components have various generic and brand names.

- **Brand Names:** The brand names for this particular combination are numerous and vary in different regions of India.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, improves peripheral glucose utilization, and reduces intestinal glucose absorption. Teneligliptin enhances incretin effects, resulting in increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion and reduced glucagon secretion. Voglibose delays the breakdown and absorption of carbohydrates in the small intestine.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Metformin undergoes minimal metabolism and is excreted unchanged in the urine. Teneligliptin is partially metabolized by CYP3A4, with both renal and hepatic elimination of the parent compound and metabolites. Voglibose has negligible systemic absorption, being primarily excreted in the feces.

- **Mode of Action:** Metformin's precise mode of action is complex and involves multiple pathways, including activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).  Teneligliptin inhibits the enzyme DPP-4, which degrades incretin hormones.  Voglibose inhibits alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the small intestine.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Metformin is renally excreted.  Teneligliptin is excreted through both renal and hepatic routes.  Voglibose is primarily eliminated in the feces.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Dosage is individualized and titrated based on patient response and tolerance. A typical starting regimen may align with the standard doses of the individual components.  Metformin is often started at 500 mg twice daily or 850 mg once daily.  Teneligliptin is usually 20 mg once daily. Voglibose is usually 0.2 mg or 0.3 mg three times per day with meals.  The dose of each component may be increased gradually as needed.

#### **Children:**

This combination is not recommended for pediatric use.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and titrate cautiously, considering renal function.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Metformin dosage needs adjustment or may be contraindicated in moderate to severe renal impairment. Teneligliptin dosage may need adjustment in severe renal impairment.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Metformin should be used cautiously in mild hepatic impairment and is contraindicated in moderate to severe liver disease. Teneligliptin may not require dosage adjustment in mild to moderate hepatic impairment but should be used cautiously. Voglibose may not need dose adjustment in hepatic impairment.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Careful monitoring is necessary, especially in patients with congestive heart failure or gastrointestinal disorders.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is not typically used in clinical situations like intubation, surgery, mechanical ventilation, ICU care, or emergency situations where more precise glucose control with insulin is usually required.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage should be individualized based on the patient's glycemic control (HbA1c, blood glucose levels), renal/hepatic function, and potential drug interactions.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal pain, bloating), headache, dizziness, hypoglycemia.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Lactic acidosis (with Metformin), angioedema, bullous pemphigoid, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, pancreatitis.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Vitamin B12 deficiency (with Metformin).


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis (rare), severe skin reactions.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to any component, type 1 diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis, metabolic acidosis, history of lactic acidosis with Metformin, severe renal or hepatic impairment, severe infections, severe trauma, and pregnancy.

## **Drug Interactions**

Other antidiabetic medications (increased risk of hypoglycemia), alcohol, corticosteroids, diuretics, cationic drugs, antifungals (azole antifungals), certain antidepressants, and other medications can interact with one or more components of this combination.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding.
