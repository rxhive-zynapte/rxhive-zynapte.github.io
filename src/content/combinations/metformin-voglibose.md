## **Usage**

- Metformin + Voglibose is prescribed for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, particularly in cases where diet and exercise alone or metformin monotherapy do not provide adequate glycemic control, especially postprandial hyperglycemia.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antidiabetic combination comprising a biguanide (Metformin) and an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor (Voglibose).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, increases insulin sensitivity, and improves peripheral glucose uptake. Voglibose inhibits alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the small intestine, delaying carbohydrate digestion and absorption, thus reducing postprandial glucose spikes.

## **Alternate Names**

-  This combination is often referred to as Vogmet.
- Several brand names exist depending upon the manufacturer; these can be confirmed at the dispensing pharmacy.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Metformin reduces hepatic glucose output, improves insulin sensitivity, and enhances peripheral glucose disposal. Voglibose delays the breakdown of complex carbohydrates into glucose in the intestine, blunting postprandial glucose increase.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - *Metformin:* Absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, minimally protein-bound, not metabolized, and excreted renally.
    - *Voglibose:* Minimally absorbed from the GI tract, exerts its action locally in the intestine, and what little is absorbed is excreted renally.
- **Mode of Action:**
    - *Metformin:*  Exact mechanism is unclear, but it activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), leading to the observed metabolic effects.
    - *Voglibose:* Competitively and reversibly inhibits alpha-glucosidase enzymes located on the brush border of the small intestine. 
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**
    - Metformin: AMPK activation
    - Voglibose: Alpha-glucosidase inhibition
- **Elimination pathways:**
    - Metformin: Renal excretion
    - Voglibose: Primarily fecal excretion; a small amount of absorbed drug is renally excreted.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial: Voglibose 0.2 mg + Metformin 500 mg, one tablet three times daily with meals.
- Maintenance: Dosage titrated based on blood glucose levels, up to Voglibose 0.3mg + Metformin 1000mg, one tablet thrice daily with meals.
- Maximum daily doses: Voglibose 0.6 mg; Metformin 2550 mg (extended-release formulation), 3000 mg (immediate-release formulation).
- **Geriatric patients** (≥ 65 years): Initiate at lower doses due to age-related decline in kidney function. Adjust based on GFR and tolerability.

#### **Children:**

-  Metformin monotherapy is approved for children ≥10 years old,  and Voglibose in combination with Metformin is recommended in children above 10 years of age. 
- Voglibose + Metformin combination dosage for children needs to be individualized, and caution is advised.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and titrate cautiously, monitoring renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m²). Adjust dose based on eGFR for moderate impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in patients with hepatic insufficiency due to increased risk of lactic acidosis with metformin.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized dosing is required. Consult latest guidelines.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  

The listed use cases of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use and emergency situations are not applicable to this medication. Metformin + Voglibose is specifically indicated for the chronic management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is not relevant to acute or emergency situations typically encountered in those settings.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Renal/hepatic dysfunction: Adjust dosage as mentioned above.
- Metabolic disorders: Individualized dosing may be necessary.
- Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism: Exercise caution.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Gastrointestinal: Flatulence, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, changes in taste.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Lactic Acidosis (Metformin): Rare but life-threatening. 
- Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function tests. 
- Hypoglycemia (especially when combined with sulfonylureas or insulin): Dizziness, sweating, confusion, palpitations.


### **Long-Term Effects**

- Vitamin B12 deficiency (Metformin): Monitor B12 levels during long-term use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Lactic acidosis, severe hypoglycemia, hepatotoxicity, angioedema.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to metformin or voglibose.
- Severe renal impairment.
- Hepatic impairment.
- Diabetic ketoacidosis.
- Inflammatory bowel disease, colonic ulceration, intestinal obstruction.
- Conditions predisposing to increased intestinal gas formation.
- Congestive heart failure requiring pharmacological treatment. 
- Acute/chronic metabolic acidosis.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Antidiabetic drugs (e.g., sulfonylureas, insulin): Increased risk of hypoglycemia.
- Drugs affecting renal function: May affect metformin elimination.
- Alcohol: Increased risk of lactic acidosis and hypoglycemia.
- Miconazole: Increased risk of hypoglycemia with glimepiride (when included in triple therapy).
- Colesevelam: Reduced glimepiride absorption (when included in triple therapy).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Metformin:**  Pregnancy Category B.  Transfer of Metformin through the placenta and into human milk is documented. 
- **Voglibose:** Negligible systemic absorption suggests low risk to the fetus or neonate; however, data is limited. 
- Consult specialized guidelines regarding the use of Metformin and Voglibose during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
