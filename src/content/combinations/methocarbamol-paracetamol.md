## **Usage**

Methocarbamol + Paracetamol is prescribed for the short-term relief of muscle spasms and associated pain.  It is commonly used to treat acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This combination drug includes a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant (Methocarbamol) and an analgesic and antipyretic (Paracetamol).

**Mechanism of Action:** Methocarbamol's precise mechanism is not fully understood, but it acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to reduce muscle spasms. It is believed to depress polysynaptic reflexes in the spinal cord and possibly in other areas of the brain. Paracetamol reduces pain and fever by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis in the hypothalamus and possibly through other central mechanisms.


## **Alternate Names**

While "Methocarbamol + Paracetamol" is the generic name, some regional or international variations may exist.

**Brand Names:** Robaxacet, Robaxisal Compuesto, Tylenol Body Pain Night (contains Methocarbamol + Acetaminophen, which is the US name for Paracetamol). Other brand names might exist depending on the region. Robinaxol Tablet is a brand currently unavailable but that previously was offered in India containing 250mg of Paracetamol and 350mg of Methocarbamol.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Methocarbamol reduces muscle hyperactivity and spasticity without direct effects on muscle fibers, the motor endplate, or the nerve fiber. Paracetamol's analgesic and antipyretic effects result from its action on the central nervous system, primarily inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Methocarbamol is well-absorbed orally and metabolized by the liver. It is primarily excreted in the urine, with a small amount in the feces. Paracetamol is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 30-60 minutes. It is metabolized by the liver primarily through glucuronidation and sulfation, with a small fraction undergoing N-hydroxylation by CYP enzymes, forming a potentially hepatotoxic metabolite. The elimination half-life is typically 1.5-2.5 hours, primarily excreted in the urine as metabolites.

**Mode of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Methocarbamol's precise mechanism is not fully elucidated but involves CNS depression.  It is believed to work by inhibiting polysynaptic reflexes in the spinal cord and potentially other brain regions.  Paracetamol inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, primarily in the CNS.  The specifics of its binding sites and interactions are not fully characterized.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  The initial dosage is typically 1500 mg of Methocarbamol (e.g., three 500 mg tablets or two 750 mg tablets) with 500-1000mg of Paracetamol, four times a day for the first 48-72 hours. The dosage may then be reduced, usually to 4000-4500 mg of Methocarbamol per day in divided doses. Alternative regimens exist, including a combined tablet of 380mg Methocarbamol and 300mg Paracetamol, taken two tablets every 4-6 hours.

#### **Children:**  Safety and efficacy have not been established in children under 16 years old.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Lower initial doses are recommended due to increased sensitivity to side effects such as sedation and possible cognitive impairment. Start with 500 mg of Methocarbamol with Paracetamol every six hours.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised. Due to the presence of polyethylene glycol in injectable forms, parenteral administration is contraindicated in renal failure. Oral dosage adjustments might be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, and dose adjustments might be necessary, especially for Paracetamol, due to the risk of hepatotoxicity.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider potential interactions with other medications the patient may be taking. For example, concomitant use with CNS depressants should be avoided or carefully monitored.




### **Clinical Use Cases**  Dosages in these settings are generally individualized based on patient needs and typically involve parenteral administration of Methocarbamol:
- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations:** Not typically used.





### **Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosages should be individualized based on patient response and tolerance. Modifications are based on renal function, hepatic function, and other comorbid conditions.





## **Side Effects**
