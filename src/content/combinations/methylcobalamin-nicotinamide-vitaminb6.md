## **Usage**

- This combination is primarily prescribed for the treatment and prevention of vitamin B12 (Methylcobalamin), vitamin B3 (Nicotinamide), and vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine) deficiencies.  These deficiencies can arise from various factors, including poor diet, malabsorption syndromes, certain medications, and increased metabolic demands.  It's also used in the management of peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage) associated with conditions like diabetes or alcoholism.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Nutritional Supplement, Vitamin Supplement
- **Mechanism of Action:**  This combination works by replenishing the body's stores of essential B vitamins. Methylcobalamin is crucial for DNA synthesis, red blood cell formation, and nerve function.  Nicotinamide, a precursor to NAD and NADP, plays a vital role in cellular energy production. Pyridoxine is essential for various metabolic processes, including amino acid metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis.

## **Alternate Names**

- Methylcobalamin-Pyridoxine-Nicotinamide
- Vitamin B Complex with Methylcobalamin
- **Brand Names:** (This will vary based on location. Several brand names exist.) Intebion-M, SP-BOL, Curoxit, Tri-B, Neurobion Forte RF, etc.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Methylcobalamin is involved in myelin synthesis and nerve regeneration.  Nicotinamide acts as an antioxidant and improves microcirculation in nerve tissues.  Pyridoxine is essential for the synthesis of various neurotransmitters.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** These vitamins are generally well-absorbed orally.  Methylcobalamin is transported in the blood bound to transcobalamin II. Nicotinamide is readily absorbed and converted to NAD and NADP. Pyridoxine is converted to its active form, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate.
- **Mode of Action:**  Methylcobalamin participates as a coenzyme in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine, a critical step in various metabolic pathways.  Nicotinamide is a precursor to NAD and NADP, coenzymes essential for numerous enzymatic reactions involved in energy production and cellular function. Pyridoxine, as pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, is a coenzyme for various enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and other metabolic processes.
- **Elimination Pathways:** These vitamins are primarily excreted in the urine.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Dosages vary depending on the severity of the deficiency and the formulation. A common dosage is one tablet or capsule containing Methylcobalamin (500 mcg - 1500 mcg), Nicotinamide (100 mg - 500 mg), and Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine) (3 mg - 100 mg) once daily. Injectable formulations are also available, typically administered intramuscularly or intravenously.

#### **Children:**  Dosing in children should be determined by a pediatrician, considering the child's age, weight, and the specific deficiency being addressed.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal function and overall health status.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, and dosage adjustments might be needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Considerations for individual comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease) might require dose modifications or closer monitoring.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing in these scenarios should be individualized based on patient needs and clinical judgment:

- **Intubation:** No specific standard dosage. Supplementation may be beneficial to prevent/treat underlying deficiency if present.
- **Surgical Procedures:** As above.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** As above.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** As above.
- **Emergency Situations:** No specific standard dosage in emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, headache, rash, itching.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:** Allergic reactions (e.g., skin rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), Sensory neuropathy (numbness, tingling, pain in extremities).

### **Long-Term Effects:** High doses of nicotinamide may cause liver damage, peptic ulcers, or gout.  Long-term pyridoxine use at high doses can lead to peripheral neuropathy.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).




## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any of the components.
- Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (Methylcobalamin can worsen this condition).
