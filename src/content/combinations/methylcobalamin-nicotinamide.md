## **Usage**

Methylcobalamin + Nicotinamide is prescribed for the treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency and associated neurological complications, such as peripheral neuropathy (especially diabetic neuropathy).  It may also be used to address conditions related to a deficiency of nicotinamide (vitamin B3). This combination belongs to the pharmacological class of vitamin supplements, specifically B vitamins.

The mechanism of action involves providing the active forms of vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) and vitamin B3 (nicotinamide), essential for various physiological processes, including nerve cell maintenance, red blood cell formation, DNA synthesis, and energy production.

## **Alternate Names**

No specific alternate names exist for the combination product. However, Methylcobalamin is sometimes referred to as Mecobalamin, and Nicotinamide may be referred to as Niacinamide. Brand names for this combination vary depending on the manufacturer and region.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Methylcobalamin, the active form of vitamin B12, is a coenzyme for methionine synthase, crucial in DNA and RNA synthesis, nerve cell maintenance, and red blood cell formation. It also influences homocysteine levels, potentially offering cardiovascular benefits. Nicotinamide, a form of vitamin B3, is a precursor to NAD and NADP, coenzymes essential for cellular energy metabolism, DNA repair, and various other biological processes. It also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Methylcobalamin is well-absorbed following oral, intramuscular, and intravenous administration. It is transported in the blood bound to transcobalamin II and distributed to the liver, bone marrow, and nervous system. Excess vitamin B12 is excreted in the urine. Nicotinamide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and widely distributed throughout the body. It is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted as metabolites in the urine.

**Mode of Action:** Methylcobalamin participates directly in the synthesis of methionine, a key amino acid, and the regeneration of tetrahydrofolic acid, crucial for nucleotide synthesis and cellular function. Nicotinamide participates in various metabolic reactions as part of NAD and NADP, playing a vital role in cellular energy production and redox reactions.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Dosages vary depending on the specific formulation and clinical indication. A common dosage regimen is 1500 mcg of methylcobalamin once daily or 500 mcg three times daily, often combined with 100-300 mg of nicotinamide. Intramuscular or intravenous administration may be preferred in cases of severe deficiency or malabsorption.

#### **Children:** Pediatric dosages are based on the child's age and weight and should be determined by a physician.

#### **Special Cases:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for elderly patients, patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and those with comorbid conditions. Dosage modifications should be determined based on clinical judgment and patient-specific factors.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Specific dosage recommendations for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations have not been established for this combination.
