## **Usage**

- This combination of B vitamins is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of deficiencies in these vitamins. It is also used to treat peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage), especially in cases related to diabetes or alcoholism.  It is beneficial in lowering homocysteine levels which helps lower cardiovascular disease risk and support nervous system health. It also plays a role in red blood cell formation.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Nutritional Supplement, Vitamin Supplement.
- **Mechanism of Action:** These vitamins act as coenzymes in various metabolic processes. Methylcobalamin (B12) is crucial for DNA synthesis, nerve function, and red blood cell formation. Thiamine (B1) plays a vital role in carbohydrate metabolism and nerve function. Pyridoxine (B6) is involved in amino acid metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis.

## **Alternate Names**

-  No widely recognized alternate names for the combination exist, but the individual components may be referred to as:
    - Methylcobalamin: Mecobalamin
    - Thiamine: Vitamin B1, Thiamine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate.
    - Vitamin B6: Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Pyridoxal, Pyridoxamine.
- **Brand Names:** This combination is available under various brand names such as Neurobion Forte,  Tri-B, Metanervon, and others which vary based on the manufacturer.  Some brand names will include additional vitamins.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Methylcobalamin helps maintain nerve cells and is involved in DNA and protein synthesis. Thiamine is crucial for the health of the heart, nerves, and muscles. Pyridoxine helps make several neurotransmitters and is involved in various metabolic processes.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** All three vitamins are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  Methylcobalamin requires intrinsic factor for absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Methylcobalamin is converted to its active coenzyme forms. Thiamine is phosphorylated to its active form, thiamine pyrophosphate. Pyridoxine is metabolized to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate.
    - **Elimination:**  Primarily renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** These vitamins are coenzymes in critical metabolic pathways, supporting the nervous system, cardiovascular system and red blood cell formation.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Does not specifically bind to receptors or inhibit enzymes.  B6 is necessary for synthesis of several neurotransmitters.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- Dosage varies significantly depending on the indication and formulation. A typical dose might be one tablet containing 1500 mcg methylcobalamin, 100 mg thiamine, and 100 mg pyridoxine once daily. Always refer to specific product information.
- Maximum daily doses should be considered based on individual ingredients: Thiamine (no established upper limit), Pyridoxine (100 mg), Methylcobalamin (no established upper limit).

#### **Children:**
- Pediatric doses should be determined by a physician based on the child's age, weight, and condition.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary due to age-related changes in renal function or other conditions.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be necessary in cases of severe impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Typically, no dose adjustment is required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider comorbidities and other medications when determining the dosage.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  Dosages in these settings should be individualized and monitored by a physician based upon the patient's specific needs. 


### **Dosage Adjustments**  Dosages should be tailored to the individual's needs and clinical status, considering renal/hepatic function and other relevant factors.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, loss of appetite, headache.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), sensory neuropathy (numbness, tingling) with high doses of pyridoxine.

### **Long-Term Effects**
- High doses of pyridoxine can cause peripheral neuropathy.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), severe sensory neuropathy.

## **Contraindications**
- Hypersensitivity to any of the components.

## **Drug Interactions**
- Levodopa: Pyridoxine can decrease the effectiveness of levodopa.
- Isoniazid, Penicillamine, Oral Contraceptives: Can decrease vitamin B6 levels and enhance demand.
- Alcohol: May interfere with the absorption of thiamine.
- Certain Antibiotics (e.g., chloramphenicol): May interact with thiamine.
- Anti-seizure medications (e.g., phenytoin, phenobarbital): Can interact with B vitamins.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
- Generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding at recommended doses.  Higher doses should only be taken under medical supervision.  Excessive vitamin B6 intake during pregnancy may cause seizures in newborns.  Always consult a physician before use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
- **Mechanism of Action:** Coenzymes involved in various metabolic processes supporting nervous system function, energy production, and red blood cell formation.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, allergic reactions, sensory neuropathy (high doses of B6).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:** Levodopa, isoniazid, penicillamine, oral contraceptives, alcohol, certain antibiotics, anti-seizure medications.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe at recommended doses, consult a physician before use.
- **Dosage:** Varies by indication and formulation. Refer to product information or consult a physician.
