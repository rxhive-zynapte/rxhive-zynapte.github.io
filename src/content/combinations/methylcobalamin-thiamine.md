## **Usage**

Methylcobalamin + Thiamine is prescribed for conditions related to vitamin B12 (cobalamin) and vitamin B1 (thiamine) deficiencies, such as:

* **Peripheral neuropathy:**  Nerve damage causing numbness, tingling, and pain in the extremities.
* **Diabetic neuropathy:** Nerve damage specifically caused by diabetes.
* **Megaloblastic anemia:**  Anemia characterized by large, immature red blood cells due to impaired DNA synthesis.
* **General nutritional deficiency:**  To address inadequate intake or absorption of these vitamins.
* **Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome:** Neurological disorder caused by severe thiamine deficiency, often associated with chronic alcohol abuse.
* **Beriberi:** A disease causing inflammation of the nerves and heart failure, caused by a deficiency of vitamin B1.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This combination falls under the classification of vitamins and nutritional supplements. Specifically, methylcobalamin is a form of vitamin B12, and thiamine is vitamin B1.

**Mechanism of Action:** Methylcobalamin is a coenzyme involved in various metabolic processes, including myelin synthesis and nerve regeneration.  Thiamine is essential for carbohydrate metabolism and plays a role in nerve function.


## **Alternate Names**

* **Methylcobalamin:** Mecobalamin, MeCbl, MeB12
* **Thiamine:** Vitamin B1, Thiamine hydrochloride, Aneurine hydrochloride

Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region. Some examples of brand names including a combination of methylcobalamin and thiamine include (please note this list is not exhaustive and brand names can vary significantly by region): *Neurobion*, *Neurokind*, *Milgamma*.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Methylcobalamin improves nerve conduction velocity, promotes myelin formation, and supports neuronal regeneration. Thiamine is crucial for the function of several enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and neurotransmission.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Methylcobalamin is well-absorbed orally, sublingually, and via intramuscular injection. Thiamine is absorbed in the small intestine.
* **Metabolism:**  Both are metabolized in the liver.
* **Elimination:**  Primarily renal excretion.

**Mode of Action:** Methylcobalamin acts as a coenzyme for methionine synthase, which converts homocysteine to methionine. This reaction is crucial for DNA synthesis and myelin formation. Thiamine functions as a coenzyme for enzymes involved in the citric acid cycle and the pentose phosphate pathway, essential for energy production and nerve function. 

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**  Methylcobalamin interacts with methionine synthase. Thiamine interacts with enzymes like pyruvate dehydrogenase and transketolase.



## **Dosage**

Dosages can vary significantly based on the patient's age, condition, and severity of deficiency. It is crucial to consult medical references specific to your region for precise dosage recommendations.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Oral methylcobalamin is commonly prescribed at doses of 500-1500 mcg daily, often divided into three doses.  Thiamine doses can range from 5-300 mg daily depending on the indication. For injections, methylcobalamin is typically given as 500-1000 mcg intramuscularly daily or several times per week. Thiamine can be given intravenously or intramuscularly at doses ranging from 100-300 mg daily.

#### **Children:**  Dosages for children are usually weight-based or age-based and should be determined by a pediatrician.

#### **Special Cases:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for elderly patients, individuals with renal or hepatic impairment, and those with comorbid conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosages in specific clinical settings may deviate from standard recommendations and should be guided by best practices and specialist consultation.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments should be considered for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, as well as those with other relevant medical conditions.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Rare occurrences of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and skin rash have been reported.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:** Allergic reactions (rare).

### **Long-Term Effects:**  Generally safe for long-term use at recommended dosages.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Rare, but can include severe allergic reactions.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to cobalamin, thiamine, or any component of the formulation.


## **Drug Interactions**

Methylcobalamin can potentially interact with certain medications, such as metformin and proton pump inhibitors.  Thiamine may interact with certain antibiotics and loop diuretics.  Always refer to updated drug interaction databases for the most recent information.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Considered generally safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding at recommended dosages. However, consulting with a healthcare professional is essential before use.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Methylcobalamin is a coenzyme for methionine synthase, essential for myelin synthesis. Thiamine is a coenzyme for carbohydrate metabolism.
* **Side Effects:** Generally well-tolerated. Rare side effects may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rash, and allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to cobalamin or thiamine.
* **Drug Interactions:** Potential interactions with medications like metformin, proton pump inhibitors, certain antibiotics, and loop diuretics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe, but consultation with a healthcare professional is recommended.
* **Dosage:** Variable depending on the specific condition and patient factors. Please refer to the detailed dosage section and consult relevant medical resources.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor complete blood count, vitamin B12 levels, and thiamine levels as needed.


## **Popular Combinations**

Methylcobalamin and thiamine are often combined with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) for synergistic effects in treating neuropathies.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess for allergies and underlying medical conditions.
* **Specific Populations:**  Dosage adjustments may be required for pregnant/breastfeeding women, children, and the elderly.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Alcohol can interfere with thiamine absorption.
