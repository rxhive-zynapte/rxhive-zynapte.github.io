## **Usage**

Metoclopramide + Simethicone is prescribed for the relief of symptoms associated with gastrointestinal disorders such as dyspepsia, bloating, nausea, and vomiting.  It combines a prokinetic agent (metoclopramide) with an anti-flatulent (simethicone).

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Metoclopramide: Prokinetic, antiemetic
* Simethicone: Anti-flatulent

**Mechanism of Action:**

Metoclopramide increases gastrointestinal motility by enhancing the response to acetylcholine in the upper gastrointestinal tract. It also acts as a dopamine antagonist, reducing nausea and vomiting. Simethicone reduces the surface tension of gas bubbles, facilitating their coalescence and easier passage.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication doesn't have a single international nonproprietary name (INN). It is typically identified by the names of its two components. Brand names vary depending on the region and manufacturer.

**Brand Names:** (This list is not exhaustive and may vary by region)
Some possible brand name combinations could exist but it is rare to find fixed-dose combination product. It is often co-prescribed or co-administered


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics (Metoclopramide):**

Metoclopramide enhances gastric emptying and small bowel transit. Its antiemetic effect is through dopamine D2 receptor antagonism in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and vomiting center.

**Pharmacokinetics (Metoclopramide):**

* **Absorption:** Rapidly absorbed orally.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily hepatic via conjugation.
* **Elimination:** Renally excreted.

**Pharmacodynamics (Simethicone):**

Simethicone lowers the surface tension of gas bubbles in the stomach and intestines, leading to their combination and allowing easier expulsion.

**Pharmacokinetics (Simethicone):**

* **Absorption:** Not absorbed systemically.
* **Metabolism:** Not metabolized.
* **Elimination:** Excreted unchanged in the feces.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Metoclopramide: 10 mg orally, up to four times a day, 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime.  Simethicone:  40-125 mg orally, four times a day, after meals and at bedtime. The combination may not be available as a fixed-dose product, requiring separate administration.

#### **Children:**

The dosage should be determined by a doctor. Simethicone is generally considered safe for use in children. Metoclopramide use in pediatrics requires careful consideration due to the risk of extrapyramidal side effects.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Start with a lower dose of metoclopramide due to potential increased sensitivity.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction of metoclopramide is necessary based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dose reduction of metoclopramide may be required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with Parkinson's disease, depression, and other conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Metoclopramide use in specific clinical situations like intubation, surgical procedures, or ICU settings should be carefully considered due to potential side effects and drug interactions. Simethicone is generally not indicated in these settings.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are crucial for metoclopramide in renal and hepatic impairment based on the degree of dysfunction. Close monitoring is essential.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Metoclopramide: Restlessness, drowsiness, fatigue, diarrhea.
* Simethicone: Generally well-tolerated.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

* Metoclopramide:  Tardive dyskinesia can be a long-term consequence of chronic use.
