      Can this combination be used in patients with asthma?**


      **A:**  Use with caution in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) as beta-blockers may exacerbate bronchospasm. 
      Metoprolol is cardioselective which means that its effect on the lungs is
      minimal when used at lower doses.

      **A:** This combination can be used alongside other antihypertensives if
      required. However, careful dose adjustments are needed due to the

      important to discuss any other medications you are taking with your doctor
      before starting any new medications.  Close monitoring is important.

## **Usage**

- Metoprolol Succinate + Olmesartan Medoxomil is prescribed for the management of hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults.  This medication is used when a single medication is not enough to control blood pressure. It may also help prevent heart attacks, strokes, and kidney problems associated with uncontrolled hypertension.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antihypertensive (a combination of a beta-blocker and an angiotensin II receptor blocker).
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination therapy targets two different mechanisms to lower blood pressure. Metoprolol succinate, a beta-blocker, reduces heart rate and the force of heart contractions, easing the heart's workload.  Olmesartan medoxomil, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. This vasodilation effect allows blood to flow more easily, further contributing to lower blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination product.  The individual components are sometimes referred to as metoprolol succinate ER (extended-release) and olmesartan medoxomil.
- **Brand Names:**  Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region. Some examples include brands like Olmetec Plus, Benicar HCT and others.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Metoprolol succinate exerts its antihypertensive effect through beta-1 adrenergic receptor blockade, decreasing heart rate, cardiac output, and renin release.  Olmesartan medoxomil blocks the binding of angiotensin II to its type 1 receptors (AT1 receptors), preventing vasoconstriction and promoting vasodilation. 
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - *Absorption:*  Both drugs are absorbed orally. Metoprolol succinate's extended-release formulation provides a slow and steady release of the drug into the system.
    - *Metabolism:* Metoprolol is primarily metabolized by the liver, specifically through the CYP2D6 enzyme. Olmesartan medoxomil is rapidly converted to its active metabolite, olmesartan, during absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and by hepatic first-pass metabolism.
    - *Elimination:* Metoprolol is excreted primarily in the urine. Olmesartan is eliminated through both renal and fecal pathways.
- **Mode of Action:** Metoprolol acts by selectively binding to beta-1 adrenoreceptors in the heart, blocking the action of catecholamines and reducing sympathetic stimulation of the heart.  Olmesartan blocks the activation of AT1 receptors by angiotensin II, inhibiting downstream effects like vasoconstriction, aldosterone release, and sodium reabsorption.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Metoprolol interacts with beta-1 adrenoreceptors, while olmesartan interacts with AT1 receptors.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- The initial dose typically ranges from 20 mg olmesartan medoxomil with 50 mg or 100 mg of metoprolol succinate once daily.  
- Dosage may be titrated up based on individual patient response and tolerability, usually at intervals of one to two weeks.
- Maximum doses will depend on the specific formulation but usually do not exceed 40 mg olmesartan medoxomil and 200 mg metoprolol succinate.

#### **Children:**
- The safety and efficacy of this combination have not been established in pediatric patients under 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Start with a lower dose and titrate cautiously based on patient response and renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes is important.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment, as both metoprolol and olmesartan undergo hepatic metabolism. Close monitoring is required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with diabetes, heart failure, or peripheral vascular disease, as this combination may exacerbate these conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**
- The use of metoprolol + olmesartan medoxomil in these settings requires careful consideration of the potential for interactions and adverse effects, and dose adjustments may be necessary based on the patient's clinical status.  It is recommended to consult relevant clinical guidelines and expert opinion when using this combination in specialized settings.
- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, Emergency Situations:** Not typically indicated for acute management in these clinical scenarios.  Other agents are preferred in these settings.


### **Dosage Adjustments**
- Dosage modifications may be necessary for patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction. Individualize therapy based on patient response and tolerability. Closely monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and renal function.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
- Dizziness, headache, fatigue, hypotension (low blood pressure), bradycardia (slow heart rate), nausea, diarrhea, and increased potassium levels.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
- Angioedema (swelling of face, lips, tongue), severe hypotension, worsening heart failure, bronchospasm, liver dysfunction, and severe allergic reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects:**
- Potential long-term effects include electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels), and worsening renal function.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
- Serious ADRs include angioedema, severe hypotension, and bronchospasm, which require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to either drug or other components.
- Severe bradycardia, second- or third-degree heart block, sick sinus syndrome (unless a pacemaker is present).
- Cardiogenic shock.
- Decompensated heart failure.
- Severe hepatic impairment.
- Bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a solitary kidney.
- Pregnancy (especially second and third trimesters).


## **Drug Interactions**

- Other antihypertensive medications (additive hypotensive effects).
-  NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) like ibuprofen can reduce the antihypertensive efficacy.
-  CYP2D6 inhibitors (fluoxetine, paroxetine) may increase metoprolol plasma concentrations.
-  Digoxin (additive bradycardic effects).
-  Potassium-sparing diuretics (risk of hyperkalemia).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** D (Olmesartan) and C (Metoprolol)
- Contraindicated during pregnancy, especially the second and third trimesters, due to the risk of fetal harm (e.g., fetal hypotension, renal failure, growth restriction).
- Metoprolol is excreted in breast milk.  Olmesartan’s presence in breast milk is unknown.  Use with caution during breastfeeding. Consider alternative antihypertensive agents if necessary.
