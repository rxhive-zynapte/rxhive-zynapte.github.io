## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** This fixed-dose combination (FDC) medication is primarily prescribed for the management of hypertension (high blood pressure) in patients, especially those with associated coronary artery disease (CAD) or heart failure.  It may also be used in patients inadequately controlled on dual therapy.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** This FDC comprises two drug classes:
    - Metoprolol: Beta-adrenergic blocker (specifically, a cardioselective beta-1 blocker).
    - Telmisartan: Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination works by two distinct mechanisms:
    - Metoprolol blocks the effects of adrenaline on the heart, reducing heart rate and the force of contractions, thereby lowering blood pressure. Its cardioselectivity helps minimize effects on the lungs.
    - Telmisartan blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that narrows blood vessels. This vasodilation helps lower blood pressure and reduce the workload on the heart.


## **Alternate Names**

- While the generic name "Metoprolol Succinate + Telmisartan" is widely recognized, there is no universally accepted alternate generic name. Variations may exist based on the manufacturer.
- Brand Names: This combination is marketed under various brand names, including Xstan-Beta (25mg/40mg and 50mg/40mg), depending on the region.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Metoprolol decreases heart rate, cardiac output, and myocardial oxygen demand. Telmisartan lowers blood pressure by blocking the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Both drugs are orally absorbed. Metoprolol succinate is an extended-release formulation, providing gradual release for once-daily dosing. Telmisartan is also well-absorbed, though food may slightly delay its absorption without affecting overall bioavailability.
    - **Metabolism:** Metoprolol is primarily metabolized by the liver, specifically CYP2D6 enzymes. Telmisartan undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism, primarily via glucuronidation. This makes it less susceptible to drug interactions involving CYP enzymes.
    - **Elimination:** Metoprolol is primarily excreted in the urine, while telmisartan is eliminated primarily in feces via biliary excretion, with a small amount in the urine.
- **Mode of Action:** Metoprolol acts by selectively binding to beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, inhibiting the effects of catecholamines.  Telmisartan selectively binds to the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor, blocking the effects of angiotensin II.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**
#### **Adults:**

- The starting dose is typically one tablet of Telmisartan 40mg/Metoprolol Succinate 25mg once daily. This can be increased to Telmisartan 40mg/Metoprolol Succinate 50mg once daily after 2-4 weeks if blood pressure remains uncontrolled. The maximum recommended dose for Metoprolol Succinate is 200mg. For Telmisartan, doses above 80mg haven't demonstrated additional benefit.

#### **Children:**

- The combination is not typically recommended for children.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:**  Start with a low dose and titrate cautiously.  Closely monitor renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments of metoprolol succinate may be necessary in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min). No dosage adjustment for telmisartan is typically needed unless severe renal disease is present.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution in mild to moderate hepatic impairment and avoid in severe hepatic impairment for Metoprolol. Telmisartan can generally be used without adjustment in mild to moderate hepatic impairment but is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Dosage adjustments may be needed based on coexisting conditions such as diabetes, heart failure, or other cardiovascular diseases.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of this specific FDC in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations is not standard practice. Metoprolol tartrate (IV formulation) may be used in acute settings such as myocardial infarction.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are made based on individual patient response and tolerability, renal function, hepatic function, and drug interactions.

## **Popular Combinations**

While this FDC contains Metoprolol + Telmisartan, other combinations may be used concurrently, such as the addition of hydrochlorothiazide (a diuretic) for patients who don't achieve adequate blood pressure control. However, this is determined by the physician based on patient needs.
