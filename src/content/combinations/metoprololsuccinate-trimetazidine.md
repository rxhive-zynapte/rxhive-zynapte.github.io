## **Usage**

This combination is prescribed for stable angina pectoris, particularly in patients inadequately controlled by or intolerant to first-line antianginal therapies.  Metoprolol belongs to the beta-adrenergic blocking agent class, while trimetazidine is classified as an anti-ischemic metabolic agent. Metoprolol works by blocking beta-1 adrenergic receptors, reducing heart rate and myocardial contractility, thereby decreasing oxygen demand.  Trimetazidine shifts myocardial energy metabolism from fatty acid oxidation to glucose oxidation, improving energy efficiency and reducing ischemia.

## **Alternate Names**

While the combination itself doesn't have alternative names, the individual components do. Metoprolol succinate may be referred to simply as metoprolol. Trimetazidine is also available as trimetazidine dihydrochloride. Brand names for metoprolol include Lopressor, Toprol XL, and Betaloc. Trimetazidine is marketed under various brand names such as Vastarel, Metacard, and Preductal MR.


## **How It Works**

**Metoprolol Succinate:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Metoprolol primarily blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, leading to decreased heart rate, contractility, and cardiac output, thus reducing myocardial oxygen demand. It also has some beta-2 blocking activity, particularly at higher doses.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** Metoprolol succinate is an extended-release formulation, meaning it is absorbed slowly and steadily. It is metabolized primarily by the liver, specifically CYP2D6, and excreted mainly in the urine.

**Trimetazidine:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Trimetazidine inhibits long-chain 3-ketoacyl CoA thiolase, a key enzyme in fatty acid oxidation. This shifts myocardial energy metabolism towards glucose oxidation, which is more oxygen-efficient. Trimetazidine does not affect hemodynamics.
* **Pharmacokinetics:**  Trimetazidine is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations in approximately 5 hours for immediate release and a longer time for extended-release formulations. It is excreted primarily unchanged in the urine, with a half-life of about 7 hours (longer in elderly patients).

**Combined Mechanism:** The combination of metoprolol and trimetazidine provides synergistic anti-ischemic effects. Metoprolol reduces myocardial oxygen demand while trimetazidine optimizes myocardial oxygen utilization.  



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Metoprolol Succinate:**  25 mg to 200 mg orally once a day, depending on indication and patient response.
* **Trimetazidine:** 20 mg three times daily (immediate release) or 35 mg twice daily (modified release).

#### **Children:**

Use of this combination in children is generally not recommended due to limited safety and efficacy data.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses of both medications and titrate cautiously. Monitor for side effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustment may be necessary for both drugs based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dose adjustment is recommended for metoprolol.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with diabetes, asthma, or peripheral vascular disease.




### **Clinical Use Cases**

The primary use case is chronic stable angina.  Dosages for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations would involve individual adjustments for metoprolol or other appropriate agents and not this combination. Trimetazidine is generally not used in these acute settings.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on individual patient response, renal and hepatic function, and presence of other medical conditions. Careful titration is crucial, especially in elderly and patients with renal or hepatic impairment.


## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects**

* **Metoprolol:** Fatigue, dizziness, bradycardia, hypotension, diarrhea, nausea, and cold extremities.
* **Trimetazidine:** Nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal discomfort, dizziness, headache, and asthenia.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* **Metoprolol:** Heart block, bronchospasm, worsening heart failure.
* **Trimetazidine:** Parkinsonian symptoms, tremors, restless leg syndrome.


### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential long-term effects of metoprolol may include worsening of pre-existing heart failure or bronchospastic disease. Trimetazidine's long-term effects may include movement disorders, including Parkinsonian symptoms.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

ADRs needing immediate intervention include severe bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm (metoprolol) and extrapyramidal symptoms (trimetazidine).


## **Contraindications**

* **Metoprolol:**  Bradycardia, heart block, decompensated heart failure, severe peripheral vascular disease.
* **Trimetazidine:** Parkinson's disease, Parkinsonian symptoms, restless legs syndrome, tremors, severe renal impairment. Concurrent use of dopamine agonists is also contraindicated.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Metoprolol:** Interacts with calcium channel blockers, digoxin, insulin, and other beta-blockers. Cimetidine may increase metoprolol levels.
* **Trimetazidine:** Although few drug interactions have been reported, caution is advised with other medications metabolized by the liver.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Metoprolol:** Metoprolol crosses the placenta and is present in breast milk. It is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but monitoring is necessary.
* **Trimetazidine:**  Data on trimetazidine use during pregnancy is limited. Its presence in breast milk is unknown. Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be avoided unless clearly needed.
