## **Usage**

Metronidazole + Miconazole is prescribed for the topical treatment of mixed vaginal infections, particularly vulvovaginitis caused by *Candida albicans* (yeast infection), bacterial vaginosis (often caused by *Gardnerella vaginalis* and anaerobic bacteria), trichomonal vaginitis (caused by *Trichomonas vaginalis*), and mixed vaginal infections where multiple pathogens are present.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  This combination drug includes two components with distinct classifications:

* **Metronidazole:** Antibacterial and antiprotozoal agent (nitroimidazole derivative)
* **Miconazole:** Antifungal agent (imidazole derivative)

**Mechanism of Action:** Metronidazole works by disrupting the DNA of susceptible bacteria and parasites, inhibiting their growth and replication. Miconazole inhibits the synthesis of ergosterol, a crucial component of fungal cell membranes, thereby disrupting membrane integrity and leading to fungal cell death.


## **Alternate Names**

Metronidazole + Miconazole Nitrate

**Brand Names:** Examples include Metindaz, Neo-Penotran Forte, Trimic, Micoprogel (Gel Formulation), Klion-D


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Metronidazole exhibits both antibacterial and antiprotozoal activity by disrupting DNA synthesis and causing cell death in susceptible microorganisms. Miconazole exerts its antifungal action by inhibiting ergosterol synthesis, a critical component of fungal cell membranes. This leads to altered membrane permeability and ultimately fungal cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Vaginal absorption of miconazole is minimal. Metronidazole is absorbed vaginally, with bioavailability around 20% compared to oral administration.
* **Metabolism:** Metronidazole is metabolized in the liver, primarily by oxidation. One of its metabolites also possesses antimicrobial activity. Miconazole metabolism data regarding intravaginal administration is limited due to its low systemic absorption.
* **Elimination:** Metronidazole is primarily excreted in the urine, both as unchanged drug and metabolites. Miconazole, due to its low systemic absorption following vaginal administration, is primarily excreted unchanged in the feces.


**Mode of Action:** Metronidazole enters the microbial cell and undergoes reductive activation, forming cytotoxic metabolites that damage DNA and other macromolecules, leading to cell death. Miconazole inhibits the fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme lanosterol 14Î±-demethylase, which is essential for ergosterol synthesis.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** One vaginal suppository (containing 500 mg metronidazole and 100 mg miconazole nitrate, or other brand-specific dosages) inserted high into the vagina once or twice daily for 7-14 days, depending on the infection and severity. Some regimens involve a single suppository daily for 14 days.

#### **Children:** Not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age (or pre-menarche).

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments are not generally necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment is generally not needed, except in severe renal failure requiring hemodialysis.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction may be necessary, particularly in severe hepatic impairment or encephalopathy. Metronidazole dosage may be reduced to 1/3 of the usual dose.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with central nervous system disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Metronidazole + Miconazole is primarily intended for vaginal use and therefore not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or emergency situations requiring systemic administration.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on individual patient factors, mainly hepatic impairment, where a reduction in metronidazole dosage is warranted.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Vaginal: Itching, burning, irritation, dryness.
Systemic: Headache, metallic taste, nausea, stomach upset.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Peripheral neuropathy (with prolonged high-dose systemic metronidazole), seizures, allergic reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects:**  No specific long-term adverse effects are typically associated with intravaginal use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** Severe allergic reactions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (rare).



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to metronidazole, miconazole, or any component of the formulation.
* First trimester of pregnancy.
* Use with alcohol during treatment and for at least 3 days after treatment completion due to potential disulfiram-like reaction.
* Porphyria.
* Epilepsy.
* Severe hepatic impairment.



## **Drug Interactions**

* **Alcohol:** Disulfiram-like reaction (flushing, nausea, vomiting, headache).
* **Warfarin and other coumarin anticoagulants:** Increased anticoagulant effect.
* **Disulfiram:** Potential for central nervous system effects (psychotic reactions).
* **Phenytoin:** Increased phenytoin levels.
* **Lithium:** Potential for lithium toxicity.
* **Astemizole, Terfenadine:** Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Contraindicated in the first trimester. Use in the second and third trimesters only if clearly needed and the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus. There's a possible association with poly-syndactyly in the fetus if used during the second and third months of pregnancy.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Metronidazole is excreted in breast milk. Interrupt breastfeeding during treatment and for 24-48 hours after the last dose.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Metronidazole disrupts bacterial/protozoal DNA; miconazole inhibits fungal ergosterol synthesis.
* **Side Effects:** Vaginal irritation, headache, metallic taste, nausea.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, first trimester of pregnancy, concomitant alcohol use, porphyria, epilepsy.
* **Drug Interactions:** Alcohol, warfarin, disulfiram, phenytoin.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in the first trimester. Use with caution during breastfeeding; interrupt breastfeeding for 24-48 hours after the last dose.
* **Dosage:** Adults: One suppository once or twice daily for 7-14 days.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for signs of clinical improvement and resolution of infection symptoms.


## **Popular Combinations**

Metronidazole + Miconazole itself is a common combination used for mixed vaginal infections.  Lidocaine is sometimes added for local anesthetic effect.  There are no routinely recommended combinations with other systemic medications for this specific indication.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Evaluate for hypersensitivity, hepatic dysfunction, renal impairment, and interactions with other medications.
* **Specific Populations:** Avoid in the first trimester of pregnancy. Advise breastfeeding mothers to interrupt breastfeeding during and for 24-48 hours after treatment.  Not recommended for pediatric patients (pre-menarche).
