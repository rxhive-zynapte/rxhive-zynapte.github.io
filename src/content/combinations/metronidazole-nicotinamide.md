## **Usage**

Metronidazole + Nicotinamide is a topical combination medication primarily prescribed for the treatment of rosacea and acne vulgaris.  It can also be beneficial for other inflammatory skin conditions like perioral dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Metronidazole is an antibiotic and antiprotozoal agent, while Nicotinamide (Vitamin B3) is a vitamin with anti-inflammatory properties.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Metronidazole exerts its antibacterial effects by disrupting DNA synthesis and causing strand breakage in susceptible anaerobic bacteria and protozoa contributing to acne. Nicotinamide acts as an anti-inflammatory agent, reducing redness, swelling, and irritation associated with these skin conditions.  It also improves the skin's barrier function.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication doesn't have a specific international nonproprietary name (INN). It's commonly referred to by its component names.

- **Brand Names:** Anaero Gel, Metrogel (contains only metronidazole), and various other generic formulations.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Metronidazole's antibacterial action is specific to anaerobic microorganisms found on the skin.  Nicotinamide reduces inflammation by inhibiting cytokine production and improving the epidermal barrier function.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**  When applied topically, Metronidazole has limited systemic absorption.  Nicotinamide is absorbed through the skin and reaches peak serum concentrations within a few hours.  Metronidazole is primarily metabolized in the liver through oxidation and glucuronidation, and eliminated via renal and fecal routes. Nicotinamide is metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine.

- **Mode of Action:** Metronidazole enters anaerobic bacterial cells and is reduced by intracellular proteins, forming cytotoxic radicals that damage bacterial DNA. Nicotinamide inhibits inflammatory mediators, strengthens the skin barrier, and reduces sebum production.


- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism for both drugs with excretion through urine and feces.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  A thin layer of Metronidazole + Nicotinamide gel is applied to the affected skin areas once or twice daily.

#### **Children:**  Safety and efficacy in children under 18 have not been established, and its use is generally not recommended.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised, and dosage adjustments may be needed for severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution, particularly in those with severe liver disease. Dosage modifications may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider coexisting medical conditions that might affect drug metabolism or increase the risk of side effects.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication is primarily used topically and is not indicated for systemic administration. Therefore, it is not applicable for scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are primarily based on the severity of the skin condition and individual patient response.  Adjustments are also necessary in cases of severe renal or hepatic impairment.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
- Dry skin
- Application site reactions (burning, stinging, redness, itching)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
- Severe skin irritation
- Allergic reactions (rash, hives, angioedema)
- Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling in extremities)

### **Long-Term Effects:**
- Prolonged use can lead to increased skin dryness and irritation.
- Potential for contact dermatitis with chronic exposure.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) require immediate medical intervention.
- Development of peripheral neuropathy warrants discontinuation of the drug.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to metronidazole, nicotinamide, or any component of the formulation.
- Patients with Cockayne syndrome.

## **Drug Interactions**

- **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol consumption during and for at least three days after treatment as a disulfiram-like reaction can occur.
- **Anticoagulants (Warfarin):** Metronidazole can potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, increasing the risk of bleeding.  Close monitoring of INR is necessary.
- **Disulfiram:**  Concomitant use can lead to disulfiram-like reactions.
- **Lithium:** Metronidazole may increase lithium levels.
- **CYP450 Interactions:** Metronidazole is metabolized by CYP450 enzymes, particularly CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. Drugs that inhibit these enzymes may increase metronidazole levels.  Drugs that induce these enzymes may decrease metronidazole levels.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** While generally considered safe for topical use, use during the first trimester should be avoided if possible. Discuss potential risks and benefits with a healthcare provider.


- **Breastfeeding:** Metronidazole is excreted in breast milk.  Short courses of topical metronidazole are generally considered compatible with breastfeeding, but monitoring for adverse effects in the infant is recommended. For prolonged use, consider discontinuing breastfeeding or switching to an alternative treatment.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Metronidazole inhibits bacterial DNA synthesis; nicotinamide reduces inflammation and strengthens the skin barrier.
- **Side Effects:** Dry skin, application site reactions, rarely peripheral neuropathy or allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, Cockayne syndrome.
- **Drug Interactions:** Alcohol, anticoagulants (warfarin), disulfiram, lithium, CYP450 interacting drugs.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Generally safe for topical use during pregnancy (except first trimester if avoidable); compatible with breastfeeding for short-term use.
- **Dosage:** Topical application once or twice daily.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Observe for skin irritation, allergic reactions, and signs of peripheral neuropathy.

## **Popular Combinations**

Metronidazole is often combined with other topical agents like benzoyl peroxide or retinoids for enhanced acne treatment.  Nicotinamide is sometimes combined with hyaluronic acid for improved skin hydration.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Perform a skin test before applying to large areas. Avoid contact with eyes, nose, and mouth.

- **Specific Populations:**
    - **Pregnant Women:** Use with caution, particularly in the first trimester.
    - **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Monitor infant for potential side effects.
    - **Children & Elderly:** Generally not recommended for children under 18; no special precautions for the elderly are needed.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid excessive sun exposure; may increase skin sensitivity. No restrictions on driving or operating machinery.
