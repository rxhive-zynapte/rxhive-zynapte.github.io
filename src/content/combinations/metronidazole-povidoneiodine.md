## **Usage**

Metronidazole + Povidone Iodine is prescribed for the treatment and prevention of bacterial skin infections, particularly in wounds, burns, ulcers, and other minor injuries.  It is also used to treat wound infections post-surgery.  This combination medication is effective against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and protozoa.  It promotes early wound healing by preventing the spread of infection.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic and antiseptic.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Metronidazole, an antibiotic, disrupts bacterial DNA, leading to bacterial cell death.  Povidone Iodine is an antiseptic. It releases iodine, which oxidizes essential microbial components, resulting in cell death and preventing further microbial growth.


## **Alternate Names**

While "Metronidazole + Povidone Iodine" is the standard generic name, the specific product names vary depending on the manufacturer. Some products combine this with Sucralfate.

- **Brand Names:** Examples of brand names include Metrogyl-P, Drez, and various other formulations depending on the manufacturer and country. Several preparations contain sucralfate in addition to these two active ingredients.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Metronidazole creates cytotoxic metabolites that damage bacterial DNA. Povidone Iodine exerts its antimicrobial effect through the release of free iodine, which disrupts microbial proteins and other cellular components.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Metronidazole, when applied topically, has limited systemic absorption. Povidone iodine, when applied topically, has minimal systemic absorption unless applied to large areas of damaged skin or mucous membranes.  Absorption of iodine can occur through damaged skin.  Metronidazole is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Iodine from povidone-iodine is primarily excreted in the urine.

- **Mode of Action:** Metronidazole inhibits nucleic acid synthesis by disrupting DNA. Povidone iodine acts as a broad-spectrum antiseptic by releasing iodine, which oxidizes key cellular components in various microorganisms.

- **Elimination Pathways:**  Topically applied metronidazole has limited systemic absorption. Absorbed metronidazole is metabolized in the liver via side-chain oxidation and glucuronidation and excreted in the urine. Absorbed iodine from Povidone iodine is primarily excreted by the kidneys.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer to the affected area once or twice daily, typically for 5-7 days. The duration of treatment will depend upon the severity and type of infection.

#### **Children:** Dosage in children needs to be determined and supervised by a doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** As per adult recommendations, while monitoring for any adverse reactions.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency due to possible iodine absorption. Dosage adjustments are needed in case of severe renal dysfunction.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution, and dosage adjustment might be needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with thyroid disorders due to iodine content. Patients with liver or kidney disease should also be monitored closely.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is generally not used in the contexts of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its primary use is for topical wound care. Povidone-iodine solutions may be used in some surgical settings as a skin disinfectant.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary based on the severity of the infection, patient's response to treatment, and any underlying medical conditions. Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may require reduced doses.  Adjustments based on metabolic disorders are not typically required for this topical combination.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Itching
- Dryness
- Redness
- Burning sensation at the application site
- Local swelling
- Skin irritation
- Small blisters

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
- Severe skin irritation

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Prolonged use can lead to thyroid dysfunction due to iodine absorption, especially in patients with pre-existing thyroid conditions.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Contact dermatitis


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to iodine, metronidazole, or povidone.
- Patients undergoing lithium therapy or radioactive iodine treatment.
- Patients with blood dyscrasias or central nervous system disorders
- Use before or after radioiodine scintigraphy or radioiodine treatment of thyroid carcinoma.
- Very low birth weight infants

## **Drug Interactions**

- Lithium:  May enhance lithium toxicity due to potential iodine-induced hypothyroidism.
- Anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin, heparin)
- Drugs metabolized by CYP450 enzymes (limited interaction with topical application)
- Disulfiram (used in alcohol dependency treatments).
- Products containing enzymatic components, alkali, mercury, silver, hydrogen peroxide, tannic acid, and taurolidine.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Use with caution. Consult a doctor before use, as there are potential risks to the fetus.  Chronic maternal use can cause neonatal hypothyroidism.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution and consult a doctor before use.  Iodine may be excreted in breast milk and can affect the infant's thyroid function.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Metronidazole: Disrupts DNA synthesis.  Povidone Iodine: Releases iodine, leading to oxidation and cell death.
- **Side Effects:** Itching, dryness, redness, burning sensation at the application site. Rarely: allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, lithium therapy, radioactive iodine treatment, thyroid disorders, pregnancy (use with caution), breastfeeding (use with caution)
- **Drug Interactions:** Lithium, anticoagulants.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult doctor before use.
- **Dosage:** Apply thinly to affected area 1-2 times daily.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor wound healing, thyroid function if used long-term or in patients with thyroid disorders.

## **Popular Combinations**

A common combination includes Metronidazole + Povidone Iodine + Sucralfate. Sucralfate forms a protective barrier over ulcers, aiding in healing.

## **Precautions**

- Avoid contact with eyes, nose, mouth, and mucous membranes.
- Do not use on large areas of the body or for prolonged periods without medical supervision.
- Monitor patients with renal impairment or thyroid disorders closely.
