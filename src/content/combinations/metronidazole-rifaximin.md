## **Usage**

Metronidazole + Rifaximin is prescribed for bacterial infections of the gastrointestinal tract.  It is also used to treat traveler's diarrhea caused by *Escherichia coli* (noninvasive strains), prevent recurrence of hepatic encephalopathy, and manage irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) in adults and children over 12 years of age.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination exerts a synergistic antibacterial effect. Metronidazole disrupts bacterial DNA synthesis and protein production, inhibiting bacterial growth.  Rifaximin inhibits bacterial RNA synthesis by binding to bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, further impeding bacterial growth and proliferation.


## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for the combination itself. It is often referred to by the names of its individual components.

**Brand Names:** RIFAXEMANIA M, Rifaxigyl-M, Xifatic M, and others (brand names vary by region).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Metronidazole is bactericidal against anaerobic bacteria and protozoa. Rifaximin has broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.  The combination provides enhanced coverage against various gastrointestinal pathogens.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Metronidazole:** Well-absorbed orally, achieving therapeutic concentrations in most tissues and fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid, abscesses, and breast milk. Metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in urine.
* **Rifaximin:** Minimally absorbed orally (&lt;1%), concentrating in the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in high local concentrations.  Excreted primarily in feces.

**Mode of Action:**

* **Metronidazole:** Reduced by anaerobic organisms to cytotoxic metabolites that damage bacterial DNA.
* **Rifaximin:** Binds to the beta-subunit of bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, inhibiting RNA synthesis and subsequent protein synthesis.

**Elimination Pathways:**

* **Metronidazole:** Primarily renal excretion.
* **Rifaximin:** Primarily fecal excretion.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Traveler's diarrhea: 200 mg of Rifaximin + 400 mg of Metronidazole twice daily for 3 days.
Hepatic encephalopathy: 550 mg of Rifaximin twice daily.
IBS-D: 550 mg of Rifaximin three times daily for 14 days.
Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO): 400-550 mg of Rifaximin + 750 mg of Metronidazole three times a day for 7-10 days.


#### **Children:**

Use in children under 12 for Traveler's Diarrhea is not recommended.
SIBO:  (3-7 years) 200 mg of Rifaximin three times daily for 7 to 10 days; (8-17 years) 200 to 550 mg of Rifaximin three times daily for 7 to 10 days.

#### **Special Cases:**

**Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically needed.

**Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution is advised, but dosage adjustment is not usually required due to minimal systemic absorption of Rifaximin.

**Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution advised for severe hepatic impairment. Dosage adjustment may be necessary for Metronidazole.

**Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider potential drug interactions.




### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing for the specific clinical scenarios you mentioned (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations) is not routinely established for this combination, as its primary role is in treating gastrointestinal infections.  Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis or treatment in these scenarios would depend on the specific clinical situation and should follow established guidelines.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be required based on individual patient factors, including renal or hepatic dysfunction, and concomitant medications.  Consult specific guidelines for appropriate modifications.




## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, metallic taste.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Peripheral neuropathy, seizures (with prolonged Metronidazole use), severe allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing).


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Peripheral neuropathy (with prolonged Metronidazole use).


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (rare),  toxic epidermal necrolysis (rare),  hepatotoxicity (rare).




## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to metronidazole, rifaximin, or any rifamycin antibiotic.  Use with caution in patients with liver disease or neurological disorders.


## **Drug Interactions**

Alcohol (avoid during Metronidazole therapy and for 48 hours after), anticoagulants (warfarin), lithium, anticonvulsants.  Inform healthcare providers about all medications and supplements being taken.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy:** Limited data are available. Use only if clearly needed and under close medical supervision.  Potential teratogenic effects have been observed in animal studies.

**Breastfeeding:** Metronidazole is excreted in breast milk.  Use with caution and monitor the infant for potential side effects.  Consider interrupting breastfeeding temporarily or using an alternative medication.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

**Mechanism of Action:**  Dual antibacterial action. Metronidazole disrupts DNA synthesis, and Rifaximin inhibits RNA synthesis.

**Side Effects:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, metallic taste (common). Peripheral neuropathy, seizures, severe allergic reactions (rare).

**Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to metronidazole, rifaximin, or other rifamycin antibiotics.

**Drug Interactions:** Alcohol, anticoagulants (warfarin), lithium, anticonvulsants.

**Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution. Monitor infant.  Limited safety data.

**Dosage:** Varies depending on indication. Refer to detailed dosage guidelines.

**Monitoring Parameters:** Clinical response (stool frequency, consistency),  liver function tests (if prolonged use or pre-existing liver disease).


## **Popular Combinations**

Metronidazole is sometimes combined with other antibiotics depending on the specific infection being treated. However, Rifaximin is typically used alone or in the fixed-dose combination with Metronidazole as described above.


## **Precautions**

Assess for allergies, liver disease, neurological disorders. Advise patients to avoid alcohol during Metronidazole therapy.
