## **Usage**

Metronidazole + Tetracycline is a fixed-dose combination antibiotic primarily prescribed for the eradication of *Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)* infection associated with duodenal ulcers.  It is typically used in conjunction with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) like omeprazole.  This combination is not recommended for other infections due to the potential for adverse effects from tetracycline.

* **Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic (combination).


## **Alternate Names**

* **Brand Names:** Helidac (with bismuth subsalicylate), Pylera (with bismuth subcitrate potassium).


## **How It Works**

* **Pharmacodynamics:**  Metronidazole disrupts DNA synthesis and causes DNA strand breakage in susceptible anaerobic bacteria and protozoa. Tetracycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. This combined action effectively eradicates *H. pylori*.
* **Pharmacokinetics:**
    * **Absorption:** Both drugs are absorbed orally, although tetracycline absorption can be affected by food, especially dairy products, antacids and iron supplements.
    * **Metabolism:** Metronidazole is metabolized in the liver.  Tetracycline undergoes minimal metabolism.
    * **Elimination:** Metronidazole is primarily excreted in the urine, and tetracycline is excreted in both urine and feces.
* **Mode of Action:** Metronidazole is a prodrug activated within anaerobic microorganisms. This activated form creates cytotoxic radicals leading to DNA damage. Tetracycline binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit, blocking the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex, thus inhibiting protein synthesis.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Helidac: Two 262.4 mg bismuth subsalicylate chewable tablets, one 250 mg metronidazole tablet, and one 500 mg tetracycline capsule, four times a day (with meals and at bedtime) for 14 days.

Pylera: Three capsules four times a day (with meals and at bedtime) for 10 days, with omeprazole. Each capsule contains 140 mg of bismuth subcitrate potassium, 125 mg metronidazole, and 125 mg of tetracycline hydrochloride.



#### **Children:**

Use in children under 8 years old is generally avoided due to the risk of permanent tooth discoloration and potential bone growth inhibition from tetracycline.  When use is unavoidable, careful consideration of risk vs benefit needs discussion by the doctor and guardians, and use would be off-label. Dosing should be determined by the treating physician.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Caution is advised due to the potential for age-related renal or hepatic impairment, which may necessitate dose adjustment.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** In patients with severe renal impairment, Metronidazole + Tetracycline is contraindicated. Dose adjustments may be necessary in less severe cases.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution, as the effects may be increased due to slower removal of both drugs. Dosage adjustment may be required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate and address potential drug interactions and disease-specific contraindications (e.g., colitis, blood dyscrasias, neurologic disorders).


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The primary indication for this fixed-dose combination is the treatment of *H. pylori* infections and duodenal ulcers, given in conjunction with other medications like omeprazole.  Use in other clinical scenarios involving intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, and emergency situations would necessitate separate administration of metronidazole and tetracycline, with doses tailored to the patient's specific needs.  This drug combination is not indicated for these conditions.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary in cases of renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or known genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.  These should be based on patient-specific factors and clinical judgment.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, constipation, loss of appetite, headache, metallic taste, darkening of tongue and stool (harmless and temporary), dizziness.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe skin reactions, peripheral neuropathy, seizures, encephalopathy, QT prolongation, *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea, pancreatitis, hepatitis, blood dyscrasias.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Permanent tooth discoloration (children), bone growth inhibition (children), potential for peripheral neuropathy with prolonged metronidazole use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug-induced liver injury.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to metronidazole, tetracycline, or any component of the formulation.
* Pregnancy (especially 2nd and 3rd trimesters).
* Breastfeeding.
* Children under 8 years old (generally).
* Severe renal impairment.
* Cockayne syndrome.
* Concurrent use of disulfiram or alcohol/propylene glycol-containing products (with metronidazole).
* Concurrent use of methoxyflurane (with tetracycline).

## **Drug Interactions**

* Alcohol (disulfiram-like reaction with metronidazole).
* Disulfiram.
* Anticoagulants (warfarin).
* Lithium.
* Phenytoin.
* Oral contraceptives (reduced efficacy).
* Isotretinoin (increased risk of intracranial hypertension).
* Methoxyflurane.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Contraindicated, especially in the second and third trimesters, due to the risk of fetal harm from tetracycline (tooth discoloration, bone growth inhibition) and potential birth defects from metronidazole.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Contraindicated. Both drugs are excreted in breast milk and pose potential risks to the infant.  Breastfeeding should be discontinued or an alternative medication should be used.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Metronidazole disrupts DNA synthesis; tetracycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, metallic taste, darkening of tongue/stool, serious effects like peripheral neuropathy and skin reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, breastfeeding, children <8 years, hypersensitivity, severe renal impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Alcohol, disulfiram, anticoagulants, oral contraceptives.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
* **Dosage:** See section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, liver function, complete blood count (CBC), signs of peripheral neuropathy.


## **Popular Combinations**

* Bismuth Subsalicylate + Metronidazole + Tetracycline + H2 blocker (Helidac therapy).
* Bismuth Subcitrate Potassium + Metronidazole + Tetracycline + Omeprazole (Pylera therapy).


## **Precautions**


Screen for allergies, renal/hepatic dysfunction, and relevant medical history. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should not use this combination. Exercise caution in children and the elderly. Advise against alcohol consumption during and for a few days after metronidazole use.
