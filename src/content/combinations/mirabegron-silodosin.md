## **Usage**

- Mirabegron + Silodosin is prescribed for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) complicated by overactive bladder (OAB) in adult men.  This includes symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia (frequent nighttime urination), and weak urine stream.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Urological agent, combination drug (beta-3 adrenergic agonist + alpha-1A adrenergic antagonist)
- **Mechanism of action:** Mirabegron, a beta-3 adrenergic agonist, relaxes the detrusor muscle of the bladder, increasing bladder capacity and reducing OAB symptoms.  Silodosin, an alpha-1A adrenergic antagonist, relaxes the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, improving urinary flow and reducing BPH symptoms.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for the combination product itself.  The individual components are sometimes referred to as mirabegron hydrochloride and silodosin hydrochloride.
- **Brand names:**  Silodosia M, Silotrif M, Sildoo M.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Mirabegron increases bladder capacity by stimulating beta-3 adrenergic receptors in the detrusor muscle. Silodosin decreases urethral resistance by selectively blocking alpha-1A adrenergic receptors in the prostate, bladder neck, and prostatic urethra.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Both drugs are orally administered. Mirabegron reaches peak plasma concentrations within 3-4 hours and has a half-life of approximately 50 hours. Silodosin reaches peak plasma concentrations within 4-6 hours and has a half-life of around 11 hours.
- **Mode of action:** Receptor binding (Mirabegron - beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonist, Silodosin - alpha-1A adrenergic receptor antagonist).
- **Elimination pathways:** Both drugs are extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4 (Silodosin) and multiple pathways including CYP2D6 (Mirabegron), with subsequent renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Mirabegron 25 mg + Silodosin 8 mg orally once daily with a meal.  Mirabegron may be increased to 50 mg once daily after 4-8 weeks if needed.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is typically required, but caution is advised due to potential age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30-89 mL/min): Reduce silodosin dose to 4 mg daily.  Severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min): Contraindicated.  Mirabegron dose reduction may be considered in severe renal impairment (eGFR 15-29 mL/min) to 25mg once daily. End Stage renal dysfunction: Contraindicated.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B): Reduce mirabegron dose to 25 mg daily.  Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C): Contraindicated.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or QT prolongation.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Not indicated for use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Dizziness, headache, nausea, constipation, urinary tract infections, nasopharyngitis, increased heart rate, abnormal ejaculation, retrograde ejaculation, nasal congestion, fatigue, dry mouth, dyspareunia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Atrial fibrillation (Mirabegron), severe hypotension, angioedema, allergic reactions (Silodosin), urinary retention.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Limited data are available on long-term effects.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Angioedema, severe hypotension, atrial fibrillation, QT prolongation, and allergic reactions.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to mirabegron or silodosin.
- Severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min).
- Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).
- Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin).
- Use in women, including during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin): Increase silodosin levels.
- CYP2D6 inhibitors: May increase mirabegron levels.
- Antipsychotics (thioridazine), antiarrhythmics (propafenone, flecainide), tricyclic antidepressants (desipramine, imipramine), alpha-blockers (doxazosin, prazosin): Potential additive hypotensive effects.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Mirabegron is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.
