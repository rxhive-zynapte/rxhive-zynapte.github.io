## **Usage**

Mometasone + Nadifloxacin + Terbinafine is a topical combination medication prescribed for mixed superficial bacterial and fungal skin infections, particularly where inflammation is a prominent feature.  It is indicated for conditions such as:

* Athlete's foot (tinea pedis)
* Jock itch (tinea cruris)
* Ringworm (tinea corporis)
* Infected eczema
* Infected dermatitis

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Mometasone: Corticosteroid
* Nadifloxacin: Fluoroquinolone antibiotic
* Terbinafine: Allylamine antifungal

**Mechanism of Action:** This triple-combination cream tackles skin infections through three distinct mechanisms:

* **Mometasone:** Reduces inflammation, redness, and itching.
* **Nadifloxacin:** Eliminates bacterial infections.
* **Terbinafine:** Eradicates fungal infections.


## **Alternate Names**

While the generic name is Mometasone + Nadifloxacin + Terbinafine, it's marketed under various brand names, including Nadoxin Plus. There are no widely recognized international or regional variations for the generic name.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Mometasone:** Binds to glucocorticoid receptors, suppressing inflammatory mediators.
* **Nadifloxacin:** Inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair.
* **Terbinafine:** Inhibits squalene epoxidase, disrupting fungal ergosterol biosynthesis and causing fungal cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

Topical application leads to limited systemic absorption.

* **Mometasone:** Primarily metabolized in the liver.
* **Nadifloxacin:** Excreted mainly in urine.
* **Terbinafine:** Metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine and feces.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a thin layer to the affected area once or twice daily for 1-2 weeks.  Treatment duration can be adjusted based on severity and response.  Avoid prolonged use, especially on sensitive areas (face, groin, axillae), without medical supervision.

#### **Children:**

Not recommended for children under 14 years old due to limited safety data. If use is deemed necessary, administer under strict medical supervision with appropriate dose adjustments.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific adjustments are typically required unless significant renal or hepatic impairment exists.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised; dose adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised; dose adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient factors and concomitant medications.
