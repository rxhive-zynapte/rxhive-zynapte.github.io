## **Usage**

This combination medication is prescribed for topical treatment of superficial skin infections caused by bacteria and fungi, such as:

*   Dermatophytosis (ringworm, athlete's foot, jock itch)
*   Bacterial skin infections (impetigo, infected eczema)
*   Inflammatory skin conditions with secondary infections (e.g., eczema, dermatitis complicated by bacterial or fungal infection)

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This is a combination product containing:

*   Corticosteroid (Mometasone) - Anti-inflammatory
*   Quinolone antibiotic (Ofloxacin) - Antibacterial
*   Nitroimidazole antibiotic (Ornidazole) - Antibacterial and antiprotozoal
*   Allylamine antifungal (Terbinafine) - Antifungal

**Mechanism of Action:**

*   **Mometasone:** Reduces inflammation by suppressing the release of inflammatory mediators.
*   **Ofloxacin:** Inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase, essential for bacterial DNA replication.
*   **Ornidazole:** Damages bacterial DNA and inhibits protein synthesis.
*   **Terbinafine:** Inhibits squalene epoxidase, an enzyme in fungal cell membrane synthesis.



## **Alternate Names**

*   Mometasone/Ofloxacin/Ornidazole/Terbinafine
* Keto 4S Cream (brand name in some regions)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

*   **Mometasone:** Potent corticosteroid reducing inflammation by suppressing inflammatory mediators.
*   **Ofloxacin:** Inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase, hindering DNA replication.
*   **Ornidazole:** Damages bacterial DNA and inhibits protein synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death.
*   **Terbinafine:** Inhibits squalene epoxidase, disrupting fungal cell membrane formation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

Topical application limits systemic absorption. Minimal amounts of each drug may be absorbed systemically. Primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism.

**Mode of Action:**

*   **Mometasone:** Binds to glucocorticoid receptors, modulating gene expression and reducing inflammatory responses.
*   **Ofloxacin:** Inhibits bacterial topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV.
*   **Ornidazole:** Forms reactive metabolites that damage bacterial DNA.
*   **Terbinafine:** Inhibits squalene epoxidase, leading to ergosterol depletion and fungal cell death.

**Elimination Pathways:**

Primarily hepatic metabolism for all four components, followed by excretion.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a thin layer to the affected area once or twice daily.

#### **Children:**

Not recommended for children under 12 years of age unless directed by a physician. Safety and efficacy have not been established in younger children.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to potentially increased systemic absorption.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use cautiously. Systemic absorption may necessitate dosage adjustment.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use cautiously. Systemic absorption may necessitate dosage adjustment.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with diabetes, adrenal gland disorders, or other skin conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication is not indicated for systemic use and is not relevant to scenarios such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments should be made based on individual patient response and tolerability. Renal and hepatic impairment may necessitate dose reduction due to potential systemic absorption.
