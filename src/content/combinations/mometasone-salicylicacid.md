## **Usage**

Mometasone + Salicylic Acid is prescribed for the topical treatment of inflammatory skin disorders, primarily moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, eczema, and seborrheic dermatitis. It is also used to treat corns and calluses.  This combination medication falls under the pharmacological classifications of corticosteroids and keratolytics.

Mometasone, a corticosteroid, exerts its anti-inflammatory action by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in skin cells. This leads to a decrease in the production of inflammatory mediators, reducing redness, swelling, and itching. Salicylic acid, a keratolytic, enhances the penetration of mometasone by exfoliating the skin and removing the thickened scales characteristic of psoriasis. It softens keratin, promoting the shedding of dead skin cells, which contributes to a smoother skin texture.

## **Alternate Names**

While the generic name is Mometasone + Salicylic Acid, it's marketed under various brand names such as Elosalic, Momate-S, and others depending on the region and manufacturer.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Mometasone, a high-potency corticosteroid, reduces inflammation by suppressing the migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and reversing capillary permeability. It also inhibits the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines. Salicylic acid, a beta-hydroxy acid, works by increasing skin hydration and dissolving the intercellular cement that holds skin cells together, encouraging exfoliation. 

**Pharmacokinetics:** When applied topically, mometasone is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation.  Salicylic acid is absorbed percutaneously, with the extent of absorption dependent on factors such as the concentration used, the vehicle, and the condition of the skin. 

**Mode of Action:**  The combined action of mometasone and salicylic acid provides synergistic benefits. Salicylic acid's keratolytic action improves the penetration of mometasone into the skin, augmenting its anti-inflammatory effect.  

**Elimination Pathways:** Mometasone is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted in the bile and urine. Salicylic acid is conjugated in the liver and excreted mainly in the urine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer of the cream/ointment/lotion to the affected area once or twice daily. The maximum daily dose is 15g, and the treated area should not exceed 30% of the body surface area. Treatment duration should generally not exceed 3 weeks unless directed by a physician.

#### **Children:**  
* **2 years and older:** Apply a thin layer of cream or ointment to the affected area once a day. Lotion is not recommended for children below 12 years of age.
* **Under 2 years:** Use is generally not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Similar dosing to adults, but monitor for adverse effects, especially skin atrophy.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution advised.  Monitor closely for systemic side effects. Dosage adjustments may be needed.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution advised. Monitor closely for systemic side effects. Dosage adjustments may be needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is recommended in patients with diabetes, Cushing's disease, glaucoma, cataract, thyroid disease, pituitary disease, and cardiovascular or liver problems.  Monitor for any exacerbation of these conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Mometasone + Salicylic Acid is intended for topical dermatological use.  It is *not* indicated for use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage modifications should be considered based on patient-specific factors such as renal or hepatic impairment, the severity of the skin condition, and individual patient response.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Burning or stinging at the application site
* Itching
* Dryness
* Redness
* Skin peeling

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Skin atrophy (thinning)
* Telangiectasia (spider veins)
* Hypopigmentation (skin lightening)
* Hypertrichosis (increased hair growth)
* Allergic contact dermatitis
* Adrenal suppression (with prolonged or extensive use)
* Worsening of existing skin infections

### **Long-Term Effects**

* Skin atrophy
* Striae (stretch marks)
* Changes in skin pigmentation
* Cushing's syndrome (with widespread and prolonged use)

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe skin reactions, signs of adrenal suppression (fatigue, weakness, weight loss), and infections at the application site require immediate medical attention.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to mometasone, salicylic acid, or any component of the formulation.
* Viral skin infections (e.g., herpes simplex, varicella)
* Fungal skin infections
* Tuberculous skin infections
* Syphilis lesions on the skin
* Rosacea
* Acne
* Perioral dermatitis
* Open wounds or ulcers

## **Drug Interactions**

* Other topical corticosteroids:  Increased risk of systemic side effects
* Topical acne medications (e.g., benzoyl peroxide, tretinoin): Potential for irritation or reduced efficacy
* Oral corticosteroids: Increased risk of systemic corticosteroid effects
* Medications metabolized by CYP3A4: Potential for altered metabolism of either drug


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** While considered relatively safe due to low systemic absorption, use only if clearly needed and under the guidance of a physician, especially during the first trimester. Not recommended during the third trimester due to the salicylic acid component.
* **Breastfeeding:** Exercise caution. Mometasone is excreted in breast milk in small amounts. Consider potential effects on the nursing infant.
