## **Usage**

- Mometasone + Tretinoin is prescribed for the short-term, intermittent treatment of moderate to severe melasma (chloasma or "mask of pregnancy").  Melasma presents as dark, discolored patches on the skin, often occurring on the face (forehead, cheeks, chin, nose, and above the upper lip). This combination therapy is intended to lighten these patches and improve overall skin tone.

- **Pharmacological classification**: This is a combination product containing a corticosteroid (mometasone), a retinoid (tretinoin), and a depigmenting agent (hydroquinone, in triple combination products containing all three ingredients).

- **Mechanism of action**: Mometasone reduces inflammation and itching; tretinoin increases skin cell turnover, promoting the shedding of pigmented cells and unclogging pores; hydroquinone decreases melanin production, leading to skin lightening.  The combination of these agents synergistically targets the different factors contributing to melasma.

## **Alternate Names**

- While "Mometasone + Tretinoin" is a clear generic designation, triple combination products also include hydroquinone.
- Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region. Some examples mentioned are: Momet Plus, Skinlite, Melapik Cream, Le-face, Marks Out, Ultrabrite Forte, and EUROSOFT DEEPCLEAN.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Mometasone, a potent corticosteroid, exerts its anti-inflammatory and antipruritic effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the skin. It inhibits the release of inflammatory mediators, reducing redness, swelling, and itching. Tretinoin, a retinoid, binds to retinoic acid receptors, increasing epidermal cell turnover, promoting the shedding of hyperpigmented cells. Hydroquinone inhibits tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for melanin synthesis, thus reducing skin pigmentation.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Topical application results in minimal systemic absorption of all three components.  However, absorption can increase with prolonged use, application to large areas, or use on damaged skin.  The liver primarily metabolizes the absorbed drug, and the kidneys excrete it.

- **Mode of action**:
    - **Mometasone:** Inhibits inflammatory pathways, decreasing the release of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and cytokines.
    - **Tretinoin:**  Modulates gene expression, influencing cell differentiation and proliferation, leading to increased epidermal turnover.
    - **Hydroquinone:** Inhibits tyrosinase activity, reducing melanin production.

- **Elimination pathways**: Hepatic metabolism followed by renal excretion.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- Apply a thin layer of the cream to the affected areas once daily, preferably at bedtime.

#### **Children:**
- Not recommended for children under 12 years of age. Some sources state it is not recommended for children below 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients**: Use with caution.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: No specific dosage adjustments are typically needed due to minimal systemic absorption.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Use with caution, as metabolism may be affected.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Consider individual patient factors, including eczema, rosacea, or other skin conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**
- Mometasone + Tretinoin combination (and triple combination products) is specifically indicated for melasma and is not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
- Adjust the dose based on patient response and tolerability. Prolonged use beyond 6-8 weeks requires careful monitoring.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
- Burning or stinging sensation
- Itching
- Dryness
- Redness
- Irritation at the application site

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Severe skin irritation
- Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling)
- Hypopigmentation (skin lightening beyond the treated area)
- Skin atrophy (thinning)
- Telangiectasia (spider veins)

### **Long-Term Effects**
- Skin atrophy
- Telangiectasia
- Steroid-induced rosacea or perioral dermatitis

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
- Angioedema
- Contact dermatitis
- Worsening of melasma


## **Contraindications**
- Hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation
- Active skin infections (viral, bacterial, fungal)
- Rosacea
- Eczema
- Perioral dermatitis
- Open wounds or broken skin



## **Drug Interactions**
- Benzoyl peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, and other peroxide products can cause skin staining when used concurrently.
- Photosensitizing agents (e.g., aminolevulinic acid) may increase sun sensitivity.
- Topical antibiotics can interact with tretinoin.
- Retinoids (e.g., isotretinoin) can increase skin irritation.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
- Pregnancy Safety: Consult with a physician.  While topical application results in limited systemic absorption, caution is advised. Some sources consider topical tretinoin a low risk but advise avoiding application to the nipple/areola if breastfeeding.
- Breastfeeding: Consult with a physician.  Limited data is available.  Minimize application area and avoid direct nipple/areola application.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
- **Mechanism of Action:** Anti-inflammatory (mometasone), increases skin cell turnover (tretinoin), decreases melanin production (hydroquinone, in triple combination products)
- **Side Effects:** Burning, itching, dryness, redness, irritation. Rarely: severe skin reactions, hypopigmentation, atrophy.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, active skin infections, rosacea, eczema, perioral dermatitis.
- **Drug Interactions:** Peroxide products, photosensitizers, some topical antibiotics and retinoids.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult with a physician; limited safety data.
- **Dosage:** Thin layer applied once daily, typically at bedtime.
