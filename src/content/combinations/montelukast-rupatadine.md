## **Usage**

- Montelukast + Rupatadine is prescribed for the relief of symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and urticaria (hives).  It is also used for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Combined medication containing a leukotriene receptor antagonist (Montelukast) and a second-generation antihistamine (Rupatadine).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Montelukast blocks the action of leukotrienes, which are inflammatory mediators that contribute to bronchoconstriction, mucus secretion, and airway edema in asthma and allergic rhinitis. Rupatadine antagonizes histamine H1 receptors, reducing the effects of histamine release in allergic reactions like rhinitis and urticaria.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate generic names.
- **Brand Names:** Montilar Rup, Smarti M, and others.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Montelukast inhibits the effects of leukotrienes, leading to reduced bronchoconstriction, mucus secretion, and airway inflammation. Rupatadine blocks the effects of histamine at H1 receptors, mitigating symptoms like sneezing, itching, rhinorrhea, and urticaria.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Both drugs are orally absorbed.  Food may slightly delay Montelukast absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Montelukast is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 enzymes. Rupatadine's metabolism is less extensively studied, but it is also likely metabolized by CYP3A4.
    - **Elimination:**  Both are primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion, with a small portion undergoing renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** Montelukast selectively binds to CysLT1 receptors, preventing leukotriene-mediated bronchoconstriction and inflammation.  Rupatadine competitively binds to H1 receptors, preventing histamine from exerting its effects.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Montelukast is a CysLT1 receptor antagonist.  Rupatadine is an H1 receptor antagonist. Information on CYP enzyme inhibition by Rupatadine is limited. Montelukast is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 and may be impacted by inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion, with minimal renal excretion for both drugs.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** One tablet containing 10 mg Montelukast and 10 mg Rupatadine once daily, taken with or without food.

#### **Children:**  Rupatadine is not recommended for children below 12 years.  Montelukast dosing for children varies with age and formulation (chewable tablets or granules):
- 6 months to 5 years: 4 mg Montelukast daily.
- 6 to 14 years: 5 mg Montelukast daily.
- 15 years and older: 10 mg Montelukast daily.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Rupatadine should be used with caution. No dosage adjustment is usually necessary for Montelukast.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Rupatadine use is not recommended in patients with renal impairment. Montelukast dosage adjustment is not usually necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Rupatadine use is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment. Montelukast dosage adjustment is not usually necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dose adjustments may be required; consultation with specialist advised.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Montelukast + Rupatadine is not typically used in the context of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, intensive care, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments should be considered based on individual patient characteristics, such as renal or hepatic impairment, drug interactions and comorbid conditions.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**  Headache, dizziness, fatigue, drowsiness, dry mouth, nausea, diarrhea, rash, flu-like symptoms, and upper respiratory tract infection.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**  Neuropsychiatric events (e.g., mood changes, agitation, anxiety, depression, hallucinations, suicidal ideation), hepatic dysfunction, angioedema, Churg-Strauss syndrome, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

### **Long-Term Effects:** Not well established, but some neuropsychiatric effects may persist.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Anaphylaxis, hepatotoxicity, and severe skin reactions.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to montelukast or rupatadine.
- Severe hepatic impairment.
- Severe renal impairment.
- Use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin).

## **Drug Interactions**

- Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: May increase plasma concentrations of both drugs.
- Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors: Use with caution.
- Statins: Monitor for potential interactions.
- Alcohol: May increase drowsiness, especially with rupatadine.
- Grapefruit juice: Should be avoided, as it may increase rupatadine levels.
- Gemfibrozil, erythromycin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and ketoconazole: May interact with the combination.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Montelukast is generally considered safe during pregnancy. Limited data are available for rupatadine, and it should only be used if the potential benefit outweighs the risk.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Both drugs are excreted in breast milk in small amounts.  Monitor infants for potential side effects.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Leukotriene receptor antagonist and antihistamine.
- **Side Effects:** Headache, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, nausea, etc.  Rarely: neuropsychiatric events, hepatic dysfunction.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe hepatic/renal impairment, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.
- **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors, statins, alcohol, grapefruit juice.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Montelukast generally considered safe during pregnancy.  Limited data for rupatadine. Both are excreted in breast milk.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 10 mg/10 mg once daily.  Children: Montelukast dosing varies by age.
