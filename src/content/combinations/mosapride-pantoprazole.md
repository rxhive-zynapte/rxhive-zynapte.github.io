## **Usage**

Mosapride + Pantoprazole is prescribed for gastrointestinal disorders, primarily Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) and peptic ulcers. It is also used to manage symptoms of functional dyspepsia, such as bloating, indigestion, and upper abdominal discomfort.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Mosapride: Gastroprokinetic agent, 5-HT4 receptor agonist
* Pantoprazole: Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI)

**Mechanism of Action:**
This combination medication works through two distinct mechanisms:
* Mosapride increases the movement of the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine, aiding in faster emptying of the stomach and preventing acid reflux.
* Pantoprazole decreases stomach acid production by blocking the "proton pumps" in the stomach lining.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Mosapride + Pantoprazole" is the generic name, this combination is marketed under various brand names like "Pantop M Capsule," "Moza Plus," and others.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**
* Mosapride: Stimulates 5-HT4 receptors in the gut, increasing acetylcholine release, which enhances gastrointestinal motility and accelerates gastric emptying. It also possesses 5-HT3 receptor antagonist properties.
* Pantoprazole: Irreversibly binds to H+/K+-ATPase (proton pump) in gastric parietal cells, inhibiting gastric acid secretion.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* Mosapride: Primarily metabolized by the liver (CYP3A4).
* Pantoprazole: Also metabolized by the liver via CYP enzymes, with a small amount excreted unchanged in urine.


**Mode of Action:**

* Mosapride: Binds to 5-HT4 receptors and increases acetylcholine release, thus stimulating gut motility. Also, blocks 5-HT3 receptors to improve gastric emptying.
* Pantoprazole: Irreversibly inhibits H+/K+-ATPase, the final step in gastric acid secretion.

**Elimination pathways:**

* Mosapride: Primarily hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4.
* Pantoprazole: Primarily hepatic metabolism via CYP enzymes, some renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The usual dose is one capsule or tablet containing 15 mg of Mosapride and 40 mg of Pantoprazole, taken once daily, typically in the morning before food.  Dosages up to 240mg of Pantoprazole have been administered, and some patients have taken Pantoprazole for over two years.

#### **Children:**

Not recommended for children below 12 years of age. Pediatric dosage has not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to increased risk of adverse effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; dosage adjustment may be needed in severe impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution; dosage adjustment may be needed in severe impairment. Doses over 40 mg/day have not been studied in patients with liver impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with osteoporosis, hypomagnesemia, diarrhea, seizures, or Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). These conditions may be exacerbated by the medication.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Specific dosing recommendations for these settings aren't explicitly available in the provided sources, but general adult dosing guidelines should be applied with appropriate clinical judgment.  Intravenous (IV) administration of Pantoprazole is possible, particularly for pathologic GI hypersecretory conditions.  The IV dosage is usually 80 mg every 12 hours.  For patients needing a higher dosage, 80 mg every 8 hours may help maintain acid output below 10 mEq/hour. Treatment with IV Pantoprazole should be discontinued as soon as the patient can take it orally.

* **Intubation**
* **Surgical Procedures**
* **Mechanical Ventilation**
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
* **Emergency Situations**


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments based on renal/hepatic function, other medical conditions, and concomitant medications are often necessary.  Consult specialized resources and clinical guidelines for specific recommendations.  If patients do not heal after eight weeks of taking Pantoprazole, they may take it for an additional eight weeks.




## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, stomach pain, dry mouth.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe allergic reactions, hypomagnesemia (with long-term use), increased risk of bone fractures (Pantoprazole), vitamin B12 deficiency, fundic gland polyps, cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus, cardiac arrhythmias (Mosapride, especially with pre-existing conditions or drug interactions).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

* Potential for increased risk of bone fractures (with prolonged Pantoprazole use)
* Risk of vitamin B12 deficiency (with prolonged Pantoprazole use)
* Development of fundic gland polyps (with prolonged Pantoprazole use)

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to Mosapride or Pantoprazole, gastrointestinal mechanical obstruction, gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, severe renal impairment, severe hepatic impairment, gastric malignancy. Patients with a known allergy to either drug should not take it. The same is true for patients who have severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min), severe liver impairment, and gastric malignancy.

## **Drug Interactions**

Antifungals (ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole), anticancer drugs (erlotinib, methotrexate), anticoagulants (warfarin, phenprocoumon), antiretrovirals (atazanavir), antidepressants (fluvoxamine), antibiotics (rifampicin, erythromycin), antipsychotics (haloperidol), St. John's wort, alcohol.  Mosapride may also interact with other drugs that prolong the QT interval and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. This combination can interact with anticholinergics (such as scopolamine and atropine), opioids (such as morphine and codeine), anticoagulants (such as warfarin), and other proton-pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole). Avoid taking Mosapride with drugs that prolong the QT interval or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors because this can cause serious heart problems. Patients should not combine this drug with Atazanavir, a drug for treating HIV, because it can reduce Atazanavir's absorption.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of Mosapride + Pantoprazole during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been firmly established. Consult a doctor before use. Pantoprazole is generally avoided during pregnancy except when no alternatives are available. Pantoprazole passes into breast milk, so it should only be used when necessary. Use of this medication during pregnancy and lactation should only be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. Pantoprazole is given to pregnant women if the benefits outweigh the risks. It is the same for breastfeeding women.

## **Drug Profile Summary**
