      should be used with extreme caution as it can significantly raise the risk
      of tendonitis or even tendon rupture. Anticoagulants, such as warfarin,
      may have potentiated effects in concurrent use.  Always consult your
      healthcare provider for any interactions with other drugs you are taking.

## **Usage**

Moxifloxacin + Prednisolone is primarily prescribed for bacterial eye infections, such as conjunctivitis, bacterial keratitis, and post-surgical inflammation.  It combines an antibiotic and a corticosteroid. This combination is useful for treating bacterial infections by eliminating the bacteria with moxifloxacin and reducing the associated inflammation with prednisolone. It is classified as an ophthalmic antibiotic and corticosteroid combination.


## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication often goes by brand names like Moxigram-P,  Vigamox,  Kapimox-P, Rotomox-P, or Zeximox-P and may also be referred to as moxifloxacin/prednisolone acetate.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Moxifloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, inhibits bacterial topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair. This inhibition leads to bacterial cell death. Prednisolone, a corticosteroid, exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors, modulating gene expression, and suppressing inflammatory mediators. It reduces swelling, redness, and itching associated with infection.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Moxifloxacin, when administered as eye drops, achieves therapeutic concentrations in ocular tissues.  Systemic absorption is minimal. Prednisolone, also administered ocularly, primarily acts locally.  Absorption into systemic circulation is limited. Elimination pathways for both drugs after ophthalmic administration are not fully characterized, but some systemic absorption and subsequent metabolism and excretion are likely.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
Instill one to two drops in the affected eye(s) four times a day. Treatment duration typically ranges from 7 to 14 days.

#### **Children:**
Use in children should be guided by a physician, with dosage adjusted based on age and the severity of the infection.  Typically, children receive one drop four times a day in the affected eye(s).  The duration of treatment may vary.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:**  Dosage adjustments are typically not necessary in elderly patients.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  For ophthalmic use, dosage adjustment is generally not needed. However, if significant systemic absorption is anticipated, caution is advised.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  For ophthalmic use, dosage adjustment is generally not needed. However, if significant systemic absorption is anticipated, caution is advised.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized dosing adjustments may be necessary in patients with conditions such as glaucoma or diabetes.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosage remains consistent for various clinical use cases, including intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations. However, the treatment duration may vary according to the individual patient needs.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

If administered concurrently with other ophthalmic solutions, a 10-15 minute interval between applications is advised. 


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
- Blurred vision (temporary)
- Eye irritation or discomfort
- Headache
- Metallic taste 
- Tearing

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Allergic reactions (e.g., rash, hives, itching, swelling of the face, lips, tongue)
- Vision changes (e.g., seeing halos or flashing lights)
- Eye pain
- Signs of a new eye infection



### **Long-Term Effects**
- Prolonged or frequent use of corticosteroid eye drops can increase the risk of cataracts, glaucoma, and other eye problems.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
- Corneal perforation (rare)
- Increased intraocular pressure


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to moxifloxacin, prednisolone, or any component of the formulation
- Active viral, fungal, or mycobacterial eye infections
- Untreated purulent ocular infections

## **Drug Interactions**

- Other ophthalmic medications:  If using multiple eye drops, space administration by at least 10-15 minutes.
- Systemic corticosteroids:  Concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids with moxifloxacin increases the risk of tendonitis and tendon rupture.
- Anticoagulants: Moxifloxacin may increase the anticoagulant effects of warfarin.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy: Moxifloxacin + Prednisolone should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed and if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the fetus.

Breastfeeding: It is unknown if moxifloxacin or prednisolone is present in human milk. Use caution when administering to breastfeeding mothers.  Seek advice from a medical professional.

## **Drug Profile Summary**
- **Mechanism of Action:** Moxifloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, leading to bacterial cell death. Prednisolone suppresses inflammation by binding to glucocorticoid receptors.
- **Side Effects:** Blurred vision, eye irritation, headache.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, active viral/fungal/mycobacterial eye infections.
- **Drug Interactions:** Other ophthalmic medications, systemic corticosteroids, anticoagulants.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; consider the risks and benefits.
- **Dosage:** 1-2 drops four times daily in affected eye(s) for 7-14 days. 
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for eye irritation, vision changes, and signs of a new infection. Check intraocular pressure regularly if using long-term.

## **Popular Combinations**

This medication, itself a combination product, is not typically used in combination with other ophthalmic drugs.  However, artificial tears may be used concurrently to alleviate dryness.

## **Precautions**
- General Precautions: Perform a complete ophthalmic evaluation before starting treatment. Rule out other causes of eye inflammation/infection.
- Specific Populations:  Exercise caution in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Pediatric use should be under the guidance of a physician.
