## **Usage**

Naphazoline + Pheniramine is prescribed for the temporary relief of redness and itching of the eye caused by allergic conjunctivitis, hay fever, and other minor eye allergies triggered by irritants such as pollen, ragweed, grass, animal dander, and hair.  It belongs to the pharmacological classifications of ophthalmic decongestants and ophthalmic antihistamines.

Naphazoline, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, acts as a decongestant by constricting the blood vessels in the conjunctiva of the eye, thereby reducing redness and swelling. Pheniramine, an H1-receptor antagonist, blocks the action of histamine, a substance released by the body during allergic reactions that causes itching, watering, and other allergy symptoms.  The combination provides synergistic relief from both redness and itching.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication is often referred to as Naphazoline/Pheniramine ophthalmic solution. 

**Brand Names:**
* Naphcon-A
* Opcon-A
* Visine-A
* AK-Con-A
* Ocuhist
* Visine Multi-Action Eye Allergy Relief


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Naphazoline, a sympathomimetic amine, acts on alpha-adrenergic receptors in the arterioles of the conjunctiva causing vasoconstriction. This leads to a reduction in conjunctival congestion and redness. Pheniramine maleate competes with histamine for H1-receptor sites, effectively blocking histamine-induced vasodilation, capillary permeability, and itching.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Naphazoline and Pheniramine are administered topically as eye drops. Systemic absorption is negligible, minimizing potential systemic side effects. The onset of action for naphazoline is rapid, within 10 minutes, and the duration of effect is up to 6 hours.  The pharmacokinetic profile of pheniramine following ophthalmic administration has not been extensively characterized, but it is also expected to have a rapid onset of action and a duration of several hours.  Elimination pathways and metabolic fate following topical ophthalmic administration are not well defined due to the minimal systemic absorption.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
Instill 1-2 drops in the affected eye(s) up to 4 times daily. Do not exceed 8 drops per eye per day.

#### **Children:**
* <6 years: Not established. Safety and efficacy have not been determined in this age group.
* â‰¥6 years: 1-2 drops in the affected eye(s) up to 4 times daily. Do not exceed 8 drops per eye per day.

#### **Special Cases:**
* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution. Monitor for potential systemic side effects, particularly cardiovascular effects, and consider reducing dosage if necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustments are typically needed due to minimal systemic absorption.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No dosage adjustments are typically needed due to minimal systemic absorption.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease (including hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia), diabetes, hyperthyroidism, benign prostatic hyperplasia, or narrow-angle glaucoma. Consult a healthcare professional before using in these patients.

### **Clinical Use Cases:**
The use of Naphazoline + Pheniramine is limited to ophthalmic allergy relief, hence dosing in clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations does not apply.

### **Dosage Adjustments:** 
Dosage adjustment might be necessary in elderly patients or those with comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or diabetes. Start with a lower dose and monitor for adverse effects.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
* Stinging or burning upon instillation
* Temporary blurred vision
* Increased sensitivity to light
* Mydriasis (pupil dilation)
* Ocular discomfort
* Eye irritation

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
* Eye pain
* Worsening redness, itching, or swelling of the eyes
* Changes in vision
* Shakiness (tremor)
* Fast/pounding/irregular heartbeat
* Headache, sweating, weakness, or nervousness (signs of systemic absorption)

### **Long-Term Effects:**
* Rebound congestion (worsening redness after prolonged use)


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
Severe allergic reactions (e.g., rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling) require immediate medical attention.  Any signs of systemic absorption (e.g., tremor, palpitations, headache, sweating) also warrant immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**
* Hypersensitivity to naphazoline, pheniramine, or any component of the formulation.
* Narrow-angle glaucoma or anatomically narrow angles.



## **Drug Interactions**
No clinically significant drug interactions are expected when used as directed due to minimal systemic absorption.  However, concurrent use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) may enhance systemic effects and should be avoided or monitored closely.  Inform your patients to disclose all medications, including other ophthalmic products, to their healthcare provider to minimize the risk of unforeseen interactions.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
* **Pregnancy:** Pregnancy Safety Category C. Limited human data are available.  Animal studies are insufficient.  Use with caution during pregnancy if the benefits outweigh the risks. Safer alternatives may be preferred.
* **Breastfeeding:** It is unknown whether naphazoline or pheniramine are excreted in human milk. Exercise caution when administering to breastfeeding women. Consider potential risks to the neonate.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
* **Mechanism of Action:** Naphazoline: alpha-adrenergic agonist (vasoconstrictor); Pheniramine: H1-receptor antagonist (antihistamine).
* **Side Effects:** Stinging, blurred vision, pupil dilation, sensitivity to light, rebound congestion (with prolonged use).  Rarely: systemic effects like tremor, palpitations, headache.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, narrow-angle glaucoma.
* **Drug Interactions:**  MAOIs and TCAs may potentiate systemic effects.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution. Potential risks exist. Safer alternatives may be preferred.
* **Dosage:** Adults and children â‰¥6 years: 1-2 drops up to 4 times/day. Maximum 8 drops/eye/day.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Eye redness, itching, pupil size, vision changes, vital signs (if systemic effects are suspected).

## **Popular Combinations**
Naphazoline + Pheniramine is itself a popular combination for allergic conjunctivitis.  It is not typically combined with other ophthalmic medications.

## **Precautions**
* **General Precautions:** Advise patients to discontinue use and consult a doctor if symptoms worsen or persist for more than 72 hours. Do not use if the solution changes color or becomes cloudy. Avoid touching the dropper tip to any surface.
* **Specific Populations:** Pregnant/breastfeeding women should consult their doctor before using. Use with caution in children, the elderly, and those with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or hyperthyroidism.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Transient blurred vision may occur.  Advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until vision clears.
