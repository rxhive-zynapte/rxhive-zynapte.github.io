## **Usage**

Naphazoline + Phenylephrine is prescribed for the temporary relief of redness, itching, swelling, tearing, and burning/stinging of the eyes caused by hay fever, allergies, common cold, or minor eye irritations (e.g., smog, swimming, dust, contact lenses).  It can also relieve dry eye symptoms. Its pharmacological classifications are decongestant and antihistamine (when combined with pheniramine).

Naphazoline is an alpha-adrenergic agonist, constricting conjunctival blood vessels to reduce redness and swelling. Phenylephrine, also an alpha-adrenergic agonist, constricts blood vessels and dilates the pupil.  When combined with other agents, additional effects may be present, such as antihistaminic effects with pheniramine.

## **Alternate Names**

No internationally recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination.  However, regional variations may exist. Common brand names containing this combination (along with sometimes additional ingredients) include Naphcon-A, Opcon-A, Visine-A, OcuRest, and others.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Naphazoline and phenylephrine are sympathomimetic amines that act as alpha-adrenergic agonists, primarily stimulating alpha-1 receptors in the conjunctiva and arterioles of the eye, leading to vasoconstriction. This vasoconstriction decreases blood flow, reducing eye redness and swelling.  Phenylephrine can also cause mydriasis (pupil dilation).

**Pharmacokinetics:** Naphazoline and phenylephrine, when administered as ophthalmic drops, are minimally absorbed systemically. The extent of systemic absorption is generally considered insufficient to cause systemic effects in most individuals. Metabolism and elimination pathways for the small amount absorbed systemically are primarily hepatic.

**Mode of Action:**  Both drugs bind to alpha-1 adrenergic receptors on the vascular smooth muscle of the eye, leading to activation of intracellular signaling pathways that cause vasoconstriction.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism with subsequent renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Instill 1-2 drops in the affected eye(s) every 3-4 hours as needed.

#### **Children:**

- **6 years and older:**  Same as adult dosage.
- **Under 6 years:** Not recommended unless directed by a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: Use with caution due to potential for increased sensitivity to cardiovascular side effects.  Lower doses or longer dosing intervals may be necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Use with caution. Dosage adjustments may be required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Use with caution. Dosage adjustments may be required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Use cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease (hypertension, coronary artery disease), diabetes, hyperthyroidism, and closed-angle glaucoma.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Naphazoline + Phenylephrine is not typically indicated for use in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary use is for the temporary relief of minor eye irritation and redness.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be needed in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. The frequency of administration may be reduced or the concentration lowered.  

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Burning or stinging upon instillation
- Blurred vision
- Pupil dilation (mydriasis)
- Increased eye redness or irritation with overuse (rebound congestion)
- Headache
- Dizziness
- Nervousness or drowsiness


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Systemic effects (e.g., increased blood pressure, rapid heart rate, palpitations) are rare but possible, especially with overuse.

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Rebound congestion can occur with prolonged or excessive use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) are rare but require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

- Narrow-angle glaucoma
- Hypersensitivity to naphazoline, phenylephrine, or any components in the formulation


## **Drug Interactions**

- Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs):  Concomitant use or use within 14 days of discontinuing MAOIs can precipitate a hypertensive crisis.
- Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs):  May potentiate the pressor effects of phenylephrine, increasing blood pressure.
- Beta-blockers:  May lead to hypertension or bradycardia.
- Antihypertensive medications: May decrease the effectiveness of these medications.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  C (consult with a doctor; use only if potential benefit outweighs the risk).
- Limited data are available regarding fetal effects.  
- It is unknown if naphazoline or phenylephrine are excreted in breast milk. Caution is advised.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Alpha-adrenergic agonists causing vasoconstriction in the eye, reducing redness and swelling.
- **Side Effects:** Burning/stinging, blurred vision, mydriasis, rebound congestion, headache, dizziness.
- **Contraindications:** Narrow-angle glaucoma, hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:** MAOIs, TCAs, beta-blockers, antihypertensives.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category C; use with caution.
- **Dosage:** 1-2 drops in affected eye(s) every 3-4 hours.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, heart rate (if concerned about systemic effects).

## **Popular Combinations**

Naphazoline and phenylephrine are often combined with other ingredients such as:
* **Antihistamines (e.g., pheniramine):**  To further reduce allergic symptoms.
* **Lubricants (e.g., carboxymethylcellulose):** To address dry eye symptoms.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions**: Evaluate for pre-existing conditions like glaucoma, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes.
- **Specific Populations**: Caution is advised in pregnant/breastfeeding women, children, and the elderly.
- **Lifestyle Considerations**: Patients should avoid operating machinery or driving until vision clears.
