## **Usage**

Naproxen + Sumatriptan is prescribed for the **acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older**. It is not intended for preventative migraine therapy or cluster headaches.  This combination medication belongs to the **analgesic** class, specifically the **antimigraine agents** subclass. It combines a **serotonin receptor agonist (Sumatriptan)** with a **non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) (Naproxen)**. Sumatriptan constricts cranial blood vessels by selectively activating 5-HT1B/1D receptors, while naproxen inhibits prostaglandin synthesis, reducing inflammation and pain.  The combined action provides broader migraine relief than either drug alone.

## **Alternate Names**

Naproxen + Sumatriptan is also known as Sumatriptan-Naproxen sodium.  A common brand name for this drug is Treximet®. Suvexx® is another available brand name.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Sumatriptan activates 5-HT1B/1D receptors in intracranial blood vessels, leading to vasoconstriction and reduced neurogenic inflammation, thereby alleviating migraine pain. Naproxen, as an NSAID, inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which are involved in prostaglandin synthesis, reducing inflammation and providing pain relief.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Both sumatriptan and naproxen are well-absorbed orally.  Sumatriptan is metabolized primarily by monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) and excreted mainly in the urine.  Naproxen is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2C9, and excreted by the kidneys.  Specific details on drug half-life, protein binding, and peak serum concentrations are not included here but can be found in the drug's prescribing information.

**Mode of Action:** Sumatriptan's vasoconstrictive effect stems from 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonism on cranial blood vessels.  Naproxen's anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions are mediated through COX enzyme inhibition, reducing prostaglandin production. This combination offers synergistic migraine relief.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One tablet of Naproxen 500mg + Sumatriptan 85mg taken orally at the onset of migraine symptoms. A second dose can be taken after at least two hours if the migraine persists, but the total daily dose should not exceed two tablets in 24 hours.

#### **Children (12-17 years):**

One tablet of Naproxen 60mg + Sumatriptan 10mg can be taken at the onset of symptoms. The maximum daily dose is one tablet in 24 hours.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution; a cardiovascular evaluation is recommended before prescribing for elderly patients with cardiovascular risk factors.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; dose adjustments may be needed based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution in mild to moderate hepatic impairment; dose adjustments may be necessary. Contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful assessment and dose adjustments may be needed for patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or other relevant conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Naproxen + Sumatriptan is specifically indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks. Its use in other clinical settings, like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations, is not indicated or recommended.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are needed for renal and hepatic impairment, and for patients with certain comorbid conditions, as indicated in the special cases section above.  Detailed adjustments should be based on patient-specific factors, creatinine clearance, liver function tests, and other clinical parameters as determined by a healthcare professional.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, tingling or numbness in extremities, dry mouth, heartburn, nausea, flushing, muscle tightness, chest pain/pressure.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (hives, difficulty breathing, swelling), severe skin reactions, serotonin syndrome, myocardial infarction, stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding/ulceration, seizures, heart problems.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic NSAID use can lead to gastrointestinal issues like ulcers and bleeding, as well as cardiovascular risks.  Long-term effects of sumatriptan are less well-established but may include medication overuse headache.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any serious or unexpected reactions, including those listed above, should be promptly addressed.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to sumatriptan or naproxen; ischemic coronary artery disease, including Prinzmetal's angina; history of stroke or TIA; peripheral vascular disease; uncontrolled hypertension; use within 24 hours of ergotamine or another triptan; concurrent use of MAO inhibitors; severe hepatic impairment; pregnancy (after 20 weeks); breastfeeding; Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or similar conditions; history of hemiplegic or basilar migraine; ischemic bowel disease; hypersensitivity to aspirin or other NSAIDs.


## **Drug Interactions**

MAO inhibitors, ergot alkaloids, other triptans, SSRIs, SNRIs, NSAIDs, aspirin, anticoagulants, antihypertensives, lithium,  and herbal supplements like St. John's Wort can interact with Naproxen + Sumatriptan.  Alcohol, smoking, and certain foods (e.g., grapefruit juice) may also affect drug metabolism or efficacy. CYP450 interactions are possible, particularly through CYP2C9 for naproxen and MAO-A for sumatriptan.  Consult a comprehensive drug interaction resource for detailed information.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Naproxen + Sumatriptan is contraindicated during pregnancy (after 20 weeks) and should be avoided during the third trimester.   If use is necessary between 20 and 30 weeks, the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration should be used under close medical supervision.   It is not recommended during breastfeeding due to potential risks to the infant.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Sumatriptan: 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist causing vasoconstriction. Naproxen: COX inhibitor reducing inflammation and pain.

## **Precautions**

Standard precautions apply regarding allergies, organ dysfunction, and potential drug interactions.  Specific populations (pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, children, elderly) require additional considerations. Monitor for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects. Lifestyle factors like alcohol and smoking should be considered.
