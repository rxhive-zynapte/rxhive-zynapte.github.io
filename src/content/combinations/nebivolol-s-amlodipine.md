## **Usage**

Nebivolol + S-Amlodipine is primarily prescribed for the treatment of **hypertension (high blood pressure)** and **chronic stable angina**.  It is a fixed-dose combination medication containing two distinct antihypertensive agents.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* **Nebivolol:**  Cardio-selective beta-1 adrenergic blocker.
* **S-Amlodipine:** Dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker.

**Mechanism of Action:**  This combination therapy targets two different mechanisms involved in blood pressure regulation. Nebivolol reduces heart rate and myocardial contractility by selectively blocking beta-1 adrenergic receptors, while also promoting vasodilation through nitric oxide release. S-Amlodipine inhibits calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to vasodilation and reduced peripheral vascular resistance.  The combined effect results in a significant reduction in blood pressure.


## **Alternate Names**

Several alternate names and brand names exist for this combination, although the generic name "Nebivolol + S-Amlodipine" is most commonly used. Some examples include:

**Brand Names:** Nebicard-SM, Nebistar-SA, Nebizem SM, Nebivas SA, Nebipril-SA, Nebilong-AM, BEVOS.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Nebivolol exerts its antihypertensive effect through beta-1 adrenergic receptor blockade, reducing heart rate, cardiac output, and renin release. S-Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes, leading to vasodilation of peripheral arterioles and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Both drugs are orally absorbed, with S-amlodipine achieving peak plasma concentration within 6-12 hours, and nebivolol showing somewhat variable absorption.
* **Metabolism:** Nebivolol is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6, producing active metabolites. S-Amlodipine is also extensively metabolized by the liver.
* **Elimination:** Nebivolol is eliminated through both renal and hepatic routes. S-amlodipine is primarily excreted in the urine and feces as inactive metabolites.

**Mode of Action:**  Nebivolol binds to beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, inhibiting the binding of catecholamines and reducing sympathetic activity. S-Amlodipine binds to L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle, blocking calcium influx and causing vasodilation.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Nebivolol selectively binds to beta-1 adrenergic receptors. S-Amlodipine inhibits L-type calcium channels.

**Elimination Pathways:** Both renal and hepatic excretion are involved in the elimination of nebivolol and its metabolites. S-Amlodipine primarily undergoes hepatic metabolism followed by excretion in urine and feces.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The usual starting dose is Nebivolol 2.5mg/S-Amlodipine 5mg or Nebivolol 5mg/S-Amlodipine 5mg once daily. The maximum dose is Nebivolol 5mg/S-Amlodipine 10mg once daily.

#### **Children:** Not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years old due to insufficient safety and efficacy data.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Initial dose of Nebivolol 2.5mg/S-Amlodipine 5mg once daily.  Titrate cautiously based on patient response.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Mild to moderate impairment requires no dose adjustment. Severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min): Initial dose of Nebivolol 2.5mg/S-Amlodipine 5mg once daily; titrate cautiously.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Moderate impairment (Child-Pugh B): Initial dose of Nebivolol 2.5mg/S-Amlodipine 5mg once daily; titrate cautiously. Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C): Not recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with diabetes, thyroid disease, asthma, or peripheral vascular disease. Close monitoring is advised.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of Nebivolol and S-Amlodipine is generally not indicated for acute clinical situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary role is in chronic management of hypertension and stable angina.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient response, renal/hepatic function, and the presence of comorbid conditions. Titration should be done cautiously, especially in elderly patients and those with renal or hepatic impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Headache, dizziness, fatigue, edema (especially of the ankles and feet), nausea, flushing.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Bradycardia, hypotension, worsening heart failure, bronchospasm, angioedema, severe allergic reactions.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Potential long-term effects of this combination are not well-established, but may include worsening of pre-existing conditions like heart failure or peripheral vascular disease if not closely monitored.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Angioedema, severe hypotension, bronchospasm, and severe allergic reactions are potentially life-threatening ADRs that require immediate medical intervention.


## **Contraindications**

* Severe bradycardia
* Second or third-degree heart block (without pacemaker)
* Cardiogenic shock
* Decompensated heart failure
* Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C)
* Hypersensitivity to either nebivolol or amlodipine


## **Drug Interactions**

Nebivolol + S-Amlodipine can interact with several medications, including:

* **CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine):** Can increase nebivolol levels.
* **CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin):** Can increase amlodipine levels.
* **Other antihypertensive drugs:** Additive hypotensive effects.
* **Beta-blockers (including ophthalmic preparations):**  Additive bradycardia and hypotensive effects.
* **Calcium channel blockers:** Increased risk of hypotension and bradycardia.
* **Digoxin:** Can increase digoxin levels.

It's crucial to consider potential interactions with other medications, OTC drugs, supplements, alcohol, and grapefruit juice.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of Nebivolol + S-Amlodipine during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.  Its use should be avoided unless the potential benefit to the mother clearly outweighs the potential risk to the fetus or infant.  Consult with a specialist for individual risk assessment and alternative treatments if necessary.
