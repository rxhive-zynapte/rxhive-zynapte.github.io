## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** This fixed-dose combination medication is primarily prescribed for the management of hypertension (high blood pressure) in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled by monotherapy with either drug alone.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antihypertensive (a combination of a beta-blocker and an angiotensin II receptor blocker).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Nebivolol, a beta-1 receptor blocker, reduces heart rate and cardiac output, leading to a decrease in blood pressure.  Telmisartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that causes vasoconstriction.  By blocking angiotensin II, telmisartan causes vasodilation, lowering blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for the combination itself. The individual components are sometimes referred to as nebivolol hydrochloride and telmisartan.
- **Brand Names:**  Several brands are available, such as Nebi T, Telma NB, Nebilyst T, and Telmistrum Nebi 40-5 (depending on region).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Nebivolol decreases heart rate, myocardial contractility, and cardiac output. It also possesses vasodilatory properties, possibly through nitric oxide pathways. Telmisartan blocks the binding of angiotensin II to its receptor, preventing vasoconstriction and promoting vasodilation.  The combination results in synergistic blood pressure reduction by addressing both cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Nebivolol is absorbed orally with peak plasma concentrations reached in 1-4 hours.  It is extensively metabolized by the liver, primarily by CYP2D6.  Telmisartan is also absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 0.5-1.5 hours.  It undergoes glucuronidation in the liver but is not extensively metabolized.  Both drugs are primarily eliminated through biliary excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** Nebivolol acts on beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, inhibiting the effects of sympathetic stimulation, leading to reduced heart rate and contractility. Telmisartan selectively blocks the AT1 subtype of angiotensin II receptors, preventing the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Nebivolol binds to beta-1 adrenergic receptors.  Telmisartan binds to AT1 receptors.  Neither drug significantly inhibits CYP enzymes, though nebivolol metabolism is influenced by CYP2D6 polymorphism.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Both drugs are primarily eliminated via biliary/fecal excretion with a minor component of renal excretion.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: One tablet containing Nebivolol 5 mg + Telmisartan 40/80 mg once daily.
- Dosage adjustment:  Titration may be done at intervals of 2 weeks or more, based on blood pressure response, up to a maximum nebivolol dose of 40 mg.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initial dose of Nebivolol 2.5 mg + Telmisartan 40 mg is often recommended. Titrate cautiously. Close monitoring for hypotension and bradycardia is advised.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** For severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min): Initial Nebivolol dose 2.5 mg + Telmisartan 40mg. Titrate slowly as needed.  Not studied in patients undergoing dialysis.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  For moderate hepatic impairment, the initial nebivolol dose is 2.5 mg. Titrate slowly. Contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution should be exercised in patients with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, peripheral vascular disease, and heart failure. Close monitoring is necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- The combination is not specifically indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Blood pressure management in these settings would typically involve other agents.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose modifications are based on patient factors like renal/hepatic dysfunction, age, and response to therapy. Titration should be gradual, typically at intervals of 2 weeks or more.
