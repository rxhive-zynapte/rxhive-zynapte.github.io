## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormones.  It addresses the hormone deficiency while also potentially mitigating certain neurological symptoms sometimes associated with hypothyroidism.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This combination product falls into multiple classifications:

* **Thyroxine:** Hormone replacement therapy
* **Nicotinamide:** Vitamin supplement
* **Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine):** Vitamin supplement

**Mechanism of Action:**

Thyroxine replaces the missing thyroid hormone, restoring normal metabolic function.  Nicotinamide and Vitamin B6 are thought to support nerve function and may help improve peripheral neuropathy, a complication sometimes seen in hypothyroidism.

## **Alternate Names**

There isn't a universally recognized international nonproprietary name (INN) for this specific combination. It is often referred to by its component names.  

**Brand Names:**  Ebexid B is an example of a brand name for this combination. Brand names may vary regionally.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Thyroxine (T4):**  Converted to the active form, triiodothyronine (T3), which binds to thyroid receptors in various tissues, regulating metabolism, growth, and development.
* **Nicotinamide:** Precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), a crucial coenzyme in various metabolic reactions.  It also plays a role in nerve health.
* **Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6):**  Essential for the synthesis of neurotransmitters, red blood cells, and DNA/RNA. Also involved in nerve function.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Thyroxine:** Absorbed primarily in the small intestine.  Metabolized in the liver and kidneys.  Excreted in bile and urine.
* **Nicotinamide:**  Readily absorbed from the GI tract. Metabolized in the liver. Excreted in urine.
* **Pyridoxine:** Absorbed in the small intestine. Converted to active forms in the liver. Primarily excreted in urine.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

Dosage is determined by the severity of hypothyroidism and individual patient factors. It's crucial to monitor thyroid function tests (TSH, T3, and T4) to adjust the thyroxine dose. Nicotinamide and B6 are typically given in supplemental doses.


#### **Adults:**

Thyroxine starting doses are typically 1.6 mcg/kg/day, adjusted based on thyroid function tests every 4-6 weeks. Nicotinamide and Vitamin B6 doses are usually in the range of 100-300mg and 50-100mg respectively but can vary widely.

#### **Children:**

Thyroxine dosing in children varies by age and weight, requiring careful titration based on thyroid function tests. Pediatric use of Nicotinamide and B6 should be guided by a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Start with lower thyroxine doses due to potential cardiac issues.
* **Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be needed based on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Careful monitoring is essential for patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or other conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is primarily indicated for hypothyroidism management.  It's not typically used in the specified clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are based on individual response, thyroid function tests, and comorbid conditions.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Thyroxine:  Palpitations, tremors, nervousness, insomnia, weight loss. Nicotinamide: Flushing, itching, nausea. Vitamin B6:  Numbness or tingling in hands or feet (at high doses)


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Thyroxine:  Cardiac arrhythmias, angina.



## **Contraindications**

* Untreated adrenal insufficiency

* Anticoagulants, insulin, and certain antidepressants may interact with thyroxine.
* Several medications, including isoniazid, can interact with Vitamin B6.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Thyroxine is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, dose adjustments might be necessary. Nicotinamide and Vitamin B6 should be used cautiously under medical supervision during these periods.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Thyroxine replaces thyroid hormone. Nicotinamide and B6 support nerve function.
* **Side Effects:** See above.
* **Contraindications:** See above.
* **Drug Interactions:** See above.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe with monitoring.
