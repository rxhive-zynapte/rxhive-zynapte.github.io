## **Usage**

- This combination medication is prescribed for mild to moderate pain relief and reduction of inflammation and swelling associated with conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, dental pain, post-operative pain, soft tissue injuries, and other painful musculoskeletal conditions.  It can also be used for acute pain such as toothache, earache, and backache.
- **Pharmacological Classification**: Analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, proteolytic enzyme.

## **Alternate Names** 

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination. However, it is sometimes referred to as "Nimesulide + Paracetamol/Acetaminophen + Serratiopeptidase."
- **Brand Names**:  Sumoflam, Nimisure SP, Velide-S. Several other brand names may exist regionally.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**:
    - **Nimesulide**: A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that preferentially inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and thereby decreasing pain and inflammation.
    - **Paracetamol**:  Analgesic and antipyretic that acts centrally on the hypothalamic heat-regulating center and inhibits prostaglandin synthesis in the central nervous system.  Its peripheral mechanism of action is not fully understood.
    - **Serratiopeptidase**: A proteolytic enzyme that breaks down proteins, including bradykinin and other inflammatory mediators, reducing swelling and promoting healing.

- **Pharmacokinetics**:
    - **Nimesulide**: Well absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, and excreted primarily in urine.
    - **Paracetamol**:  Rapidly absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, and excreted in urine, primarily as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.
    - **Serratiopeptidase**: Absorbed in the intestines and distributed throughout the body.  Its metabolism and elimination pathways are not fully characterized.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- One tablet (containing the specific strengths of each component as prescribed) twice daily, preferably after meals.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for children under 12 years of age.  For adolescents (12-18 years), the adult dose may be appropriate, but clinical judgment should be exercised.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to increased risk of adverse effects. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dose reduction may be required in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.  Contraindicated in severe renal failure.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Contraindicated in patients with severe liver disease. Use with caution in mild to moderate liver impairment; dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Use with caution in patients with a history of peptic ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding, heart failure, hypertension, asthma, or other relevant conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  

Dosage for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations should be determined on a case-by-case basis by the attending physician, considering the patient's specific needs and condition. There are no fixed dosage recommendations for these scenarios.
