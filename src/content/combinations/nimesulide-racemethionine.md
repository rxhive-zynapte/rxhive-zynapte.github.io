      or severe effects, consider discontinuing the medication and exploring
      alternative treatments.  Serious side effects, such as signs of
      hepatotoxicity, require immediate medical intervention.

## **Usage**

Nimesulide + Racemethionine is primarily prescribed for the relief of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal disorders.  It combines the analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties of Nimesulide, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), with Racemethionine, an amino acid believed to promote cartilage repair.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Analgesic, Anti-inflammatory, Chondroprotective (Racemethionine component)

- **Mechanism of Action:** Nimesulide preferentially inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, thus diminishing pain and inflammation. Racemethionine, a sulfur-containing amino acid, is thought to aid in cartilage regeneration and enhance joint health, although its precise mechanism isn't fully understood.

## **Alternate Names** 

- Namsafe
- Namplus
- Nafsafe

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Nimesulide exerts analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects primarily through selective COX-2 inhibition, reducing prostaglandin production. Racemethionine may contribute to cartilage repair and mitigate joint damage.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Nimesulide is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration.
    - **Metabolism:** Nimesulide is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2C9. The primary metabolite, hydroxynimesulide, is also pharmacologically active.
    - **Elimination:** Nimesulide and its metabolites are primarily excreted in urine. The elimination half-life is relatively short (1.8-4.7 hours for nimesulide and 2.9-8.7 hours for the metabolite).

- **Mode of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Nimesulide acts by selectively inhibiting COX-2.  The specific interactions of racemethionine are less well-defined but are thought to be related to its role in cartilage synthesis and metabolism.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of nimesulide and its metabolites.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

100mg Nimesulide + 50mg Racemethionine twice daily after meals. The maximum daily dose of Nimesulide should not exceed 200mg. Treatment duration should be as short as possible, generally not exceeding 15 days.


#### **Children:**

Contraindicated in children under 12 years of age.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose reduction is usually required but necessitates careful monitoring.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is required for mild to moderate impairment (creatinine clearance 30-80 ml/min). Contraindicated in severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min).
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, a history of peptic ulcers, or other relevant conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of Nimesulide + Racemethionine is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its primary indication is the management of musculoskeletal pain and inflammation, mainly osteoarthritis.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be needed based on individual patient factors, including renal/hepatic function, metabolic disorders, and potential drug interactions.

## **Side Effects**

## **Popular Combinations**

Nimesulide is sometimes combined with paracetamol, but caution is advised due to the increased risk of adverse effects.  The combination of Nimesulide + Racemethionine is less frequently used.

## **Precautions**
