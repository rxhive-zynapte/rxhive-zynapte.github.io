## **Usage**

Nimesulide + Tolperisone is prescribed for the relief of painful muscle spasms associated with musculoskeletal conditions such as:

*   Rigidity
*   Tension
*   Stiffness
*   Skeletal muscle spasms
*   Ankylosing spondylitis
*   Osteoarthritis
*   Back pain

**Pharmacological Classification:**

*   Tolperisone: Centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant
*   Nimesulide: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)

**Mechanism of Action:**

*   Tolperisone: Acts centrally on the brain and spinal cord, reducing muscle tone and spasms.  It also improves peripheral blood flow to muscles, thereby reducing pain.
*   Nimesulide: Primarily inhibits COX-2, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and inflammation.  It also inhibits COX-1, cartilage breakdown, and cytokine formation.

## **Alternate Names**

The combination may be referred to by various brand names depending on the manufacturer and region.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

*   Tolperisone: Reduces muscle tone and spasms by acting on the central nervous system. It also improves peripheral blood flow to muscles, alleviating pain.
*   Nimesulide: Exerts analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects through COX-2 inhibition. It also offers some cartilage protection by inhibiting COX-1 and reduces cytokine formation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   Tolperisone: Well absorbed orally, metabolized in the liver, and primarily eliminated in urine.
*   Nimesulide: Rapidly absorbed orally, highly protein-bound, extensively metabolized in the liver (primarily to 4-hydroxynimesulide), and excreted in urine and feces.

**Mode of Action:**

*   Tolperisone: Blocks sodium and calcium channels in the spinal cord, inhibiting spinal reflexes through presynaptic blockade of neurotransmitter release.
*   Nimesulide: Inhibits COX-2 enzymes, thus reducing prostaglandin production, which are mediators of pain and inflammation.

**Elimination Pathways:**

*   Tolperisone: Renal excretion (primarily).
*   Nimesulide: Hepatic metabolism (primarily) followed by renal and fecal excretion.



## **Dosage**
