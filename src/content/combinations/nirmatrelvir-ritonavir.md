## **Usage**

Nirmatrelvir + Ritonavir, sold under the brand name Paxlovid, is an antiviral medication prescribed for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in non-hospitalized adult and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.  It is crucial that treatment be initiated as soon as possible after diagnosis and within five days of symptom onset.

It is classified as an **antiviral**.

Nirmatrelvir inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease, an enzyme essential for viral replication.  Ritonavir, a pharmacokinetic enhancer, slows the metabolism of nirmatrelvir, thereby increasing its concentration in the body and prolonging its antiviral effect.

## **Alternate Names**

The generic name is Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir. The most common brand name is Paxlovid.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Nirmatrelvir targets the SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease, essential for viral replication. By inhibiting this protease, nirmatrelvir disrupts the viral life cycle and reduces viral load. Ritonavir inhibits CYP3A, the primary enzyme responsible for nirmatrelvir metabolism. This inhibition leads to increased plasma concentrations and a longer half-life of nirmatrelvir, enhancing its antiviral effect.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Both nirmatrelvir and ritonavir are administered orally.  Ritonavir significantly boosts the bioavailability of nirmatrelvir.  Both drugs are metabolized primarily by the liver, with ritonavir significantly impacting nirmatrelvir's metabolism due to CYP3A inhibition. Both drugs are primarily eliminated through hepatic routes.  Dose adjustments may be required for patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

**Mode of Action:** Nirmatrelvir acts by binding to the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease, inhibiting its function. This prevents the cleavage of viral polyproteins, essential for the assembly of new viral particles.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism and excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  300 mg nirmatrelvir (two 150 mg tablets) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet) taken orally twice daily for five days.  All three tablets should be taken together, with or without food.

#### **Children (12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg):** Same as adult dosing.

#### **Children (under 12 years or weighing less than 40 kg):** Use and dose must be determined by a doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dose adjustment is recommended unless there is renal impairment.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    - Mild renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min): No dose adjustment needed.
    - Moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min): 150 mg nirmatrelvir/100 mg ritonavir every 12 hours for 5 days.
    - Severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min):  Contraindicated.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No dose adjustment is recommended for mild or moderate hepatic impairment.  Use with caution in severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring is recommended, particularly for those with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or other conditions requiring concomitant medications that may interact with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir is specifically indicated for *outpatient* treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in patients at high risk of disease progression. Its use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations is not standard practice.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are primarily based on renal function.  Drug interactions require careful consideration and may necessitate dosage modifications or discontinuation of interacting medications.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
Dysgeusia (altered taste), diarrhea, vomiting, headache, muscle aches, hypertension, nausea, abdominal pain, and feeling generally unwell.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), liver dysfunction (jaundice, dark urine, light stools, loss of appetite).

### **Long-Term Effects**

Limited data available on long-term effects.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, severe liver dysfunction, drug interactions leading to toxicity.



## **Contraindications**

- Severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 ml/min).
- Hypersensitivity to nirmatrelvir, ritonavir, or any of the excipients.
- Coadministration with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening reactions.


## **Drug Interactions**

Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir has numerous significant drug interactions due to ritonavir's potent CYP3A4 inhibition. Consult a comprehensive drug interaction resource before prescribing. Some examples include certain antiarrhythmics, anticonvulsants, anticoagulants, antidepressants, antipsychotics,  immunosuppressants, and statins.  It is also important to consider interactions with OTC drugs, supplements (e.g., St. John's wort), and lifestyle factors such as alcohol and grapefruit juice.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Limited data available on pregnancy. Not recommended unless the benefits outweigh the potential risks.  A healthcare provider should discuss the individual situation and the risks and benefits.

Breastfeeding is not recommended during Paxlovid treatment and for 7 days after the final dose.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Nirmatrelvir inhibits SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease; ritonavir boosts nirmatrelvir levels by inhibiting CYP3A.
- **Side Effects:**  Dysgeusia, diarrhea, hypertension, myalgia, vomiting, headache.

## **Popular Combinations**

Not applicable, as Paxlovid is a fixed-dose combination.


## **Precautions**

Screen for renal and hepatic impairment, drug interactions, and allergies.  Caution in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Advise patients on potential side effects and drug interactions.
