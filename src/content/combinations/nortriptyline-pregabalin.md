## **Usage**

- This combination is primarily prescribed for the management of neuropathic pain (nerve pain) associated with conditions such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia (shingles pain), spinal cord injury, fibromyalgia, and chronic low back pain.  It can also be used for other types of neuropathic pain where the combination is deemed appropriate by the physician.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Pregabalin is an anticonvulsant and Nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Pregabalin works by binding to calcium channels on nerve cells, reducing the release of neurotransmitters associated with pain signals. Nortriptyline increases the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine, neurotransmitters that play a role in mood regulation and pain perception.  The combination targets pain through distinct but complementary mechanisms.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names for the combination itself exist.  However, the individual components may have other names in specific regions or in veterinary practice.
- **Brand Names:**  The combination is marketed under various brand names like Nuring NT, Pregalin NT, and Pregabid NT. Other brand names may also exist.



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Pregabalin reduces neuronal excitability by modulating calcium channels. Nortriptyline inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, increasing their synaptic concentrations. These combined effects reduce pain signaling and improve mood.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - *Pregabalin:* Rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with high bioavailability (â‰¥90%). Peak plasma concentration reached within 1.5 hours. Steady state achieved in 24-48 hours.  Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.
    - *Nortriptyline:* Well-absorbed orally, but undergoes significant first-pass metabolism.  Metabolized in the liver (primarily by CYP2D6) to active metabolites. Eliminated through renal and biliary routes.
- **Mode of Action:** Pregabalin binds to the alpha2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels, reducing calcium influx into nerve terminals and decreasing the release of neurotransmitters like glutamate, noradrenaline, and substance P. Nortriptyline inhibits the presynaptic reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, leading to enhanced neurotransmission.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Pregabalin binds to the alpha2-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels. Nortriptyline inhibits the reuptake transporters for serotonin and norepinephrine.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Pregabalin is primarily eliminated unchanged through renal excretion. Nortriptyline undergoes hepatic metabolism via CYP enzymes (mainly CYP2D6) and is eliminated via both renal and hepatic routes.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

-  The dosage is individualized and based on the patient's response and tolerability. A common starting dose is Pregabalin 75 mg + Nortriptyline 10 mg twice daily. The dose can be titrated upwards as needed.
- The maximum dose for Pregabalin is generally 600 mg/day, while for Nortriptyline, it's typically up to 150 mg/day, though lower doses are often used in the combination. 

#### **Children:**

-  Safety and efficacy have not been established in children.  Use is generally not recommended.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a low dose and titrate cautiously, monitoring closely for adverse effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Pregabalin dose reduction is necessary. Nortriptyline dose adjustment may be required depending on the degree of impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advised, and dose adjustment for both drugs may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized dosing is required, considering the specific comorbid conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The primary use is for chronic neuropathic pain. The combination is generally *not* used in acute settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on patient-specific factors like age, renal/hepatic function, and comorbidities. Therapeutic drug monitoring may be helpful, especially for Nortriptyline.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, weight gain, peripheral edema, nausea, headache, and fatigue.
