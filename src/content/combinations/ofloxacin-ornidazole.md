      **A:**  Ofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV,
      interfering with bacterial DNA replication. Ornidazole disrupts microbial
      DNA structure and function, leading to cell death in both bacteria and
      protozoa.

## **Usage**

Ofloxacin + Ornidazole is a combination antibiotic used to treat various bacterial and protozoal infections. Ofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, while Ornidazole is a nitroimidazole antibiotic. This combination is effective against a broad spectrum of microorganisms.  It is commonly prescribed for:

* **Diarrhea caused by mixed infections (bacterial and protozoal):** This is one of the primary indications for this drug combination.
* **Intra-abdominal infections:**  Such as peritonitis.
* **Gynecological and pelvic infections:** Including bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, and pelvic inflammatory disease.
* **Skin and soft tissue infections:** Such as cellulitis and wound infections.
* **Respiratory tract infections:** Like bronchitis and pneumonia (though other options might be preferred for these).
* **Sexually transmitted infections (STIs):** Including gonorrhea, chlamydia, and mixed infections of the urethra and cervix.
* **Urinary tract infections (UTIs):** Including cystitis and prostatitis.
* **Gastrointestinal infections:** Such as giardiasis and amoebiasis (including amoebic dysentery and liver abscess).
* **Surgical prophylaxis:** To prevent infections during surgical procedures, especially involving the colon or gynecological areas.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic (combination of fluoroquinolone and nitroimidazole).


## **Alternate Names**

There isn't a universally recognized alternate name for this combination. It is generally referred to as "Ofloxacin + Ornidazole" or "Ofloxacin and Ornidazole".

**Brand Names:** Several brand names exist depending on the region and manufacturer. Some examples include Oflozole, O-Cebran-OZ, Ornilox and Oflozee OZ.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Ofloxacin:** Inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and transcription, leading to bacterial cell death.
* **Ornidazole:** Disrupts microbial DNA synthesis and structure, causing cell death in both bacteria and protozoa.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Ofloxacin:**  Well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1-2 hours. Metabolized in the liver to a small extent and primarily excreted by the kidneys.
* **Ornidazole:** Also well-absorbed orally.  Metabolized in the liver, and metabolites are excreted in urine.

**Mechanism of Action:**  

* **Ofloxacin:** Targets DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair.  By inhibiting these enzymes, Ofloxacin prevents bacterial DNA from unwinding and duplicating, halting bacterial growth.
* **Ornidazole:**  Undergoes reductive activation within anaerobic microorganisms, forming cytotoxic metabolites. These metabolites interact with DNA, causing strand breakage and inhibiting DNA repair and synthesis, leading to cell death.

**Elimination Pathways:**  

* **Ofloxacin:** Primarily renal excretion.
* **Ornidazole:**  Hepatic metabolism followed by renal excretion of metabolites.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The usual adult dose is one tablet of Ofloxacin 200mg + Ornidazole 500mg twice daily. The dose can be increased in severe infections.  Tablets should be taken with or without food.



#### **Children:**

Ofloxacin is generally contraindicated in children and growing adolescents due to the risk of cartilage damage. While ornidazole can be used in children, the combined formulation is typically avoided.  For children aged 8-12, a lower dose combination (Ofloxacin 100mg + Ornidazole 250mg) may be used, but only under strict medical supervision.



#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance may be needed. Close monitoring of renal and hepatic function is recommended.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Ofloxacin dosage needs to be reduced based on creatinine clearance. Ornidazole dosage does not usually require adjustment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Ofloxacin dose reduction may be necessary in severe liver disease.  Ornidazole dosing interval may be doubled in severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution should be exercised in patients with epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, heart conditions, coagulation disorders, and diabetes.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage and duration of treatment in these settings should be determined by the treating physician based on individual patient factors and infection severity. The guidelines provided under 'Standard Dosage' generally apply.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are typically required in elderly patients, and those with renal or hepatic impairment, as described above.  Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism are not routinely tested for, but individual patient response should be monitored.




## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, diarrhea, insomnia, itching, vaginal inflammation.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Seizures, peripheral neuropathy, tendonitis, tendon rupture, hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis), severe skin reactions,  hepatotoxicity, QT interval prolongation, *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Peripheral neuropathy and tendon damage can potentially have long-term consequences.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hepatotoxicity, seizures, and tendon rupture require immediate medical attention.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to Ofloxacin, Ornidazole, or other quinolones/nitroimidazoles.
* Epilepsy or conditions that lower seizure threshold.
* Myasthenia gravis.
* Pregnancy (especially first trimester, though Ornidazole is generally avoided throughout pregnancy).
* Breastfeeding.
* Children and growing adolescents (due to Ofloxacin).
* History of tendon disorders related to fluoroquinolone use.
* G6PD deficiency.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Antacids:** Reduce the absorption of Ofloxacin.
* **Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin):** Ofloxacin may enhance the effects of warfarin.
* **Antidiabetics:** May interact with Ofloxacin, potentially causing hypoglycemia.
* **Corticosteroids:** Increase the risk of tendon rupture.
* **Theophylline:**  Ofloxacin can increase theophylline levels.
* **Cimetidine:** May increase Ofloxacin levels.
* **Probenecid:** May reduce Ofloxacin elimination.
* **Drugs that prolong QT interval:**  Use with caution as both Ofloxacin and Ornidazole can prolong the QT interval.
* **Alcohol:**  May increase the risk of adverse effects, particularly dizziness and gastrointestinal issues.
* **Dairy products:**  May reduce Ofloxacin absorption.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Contraindicated.  Ofloxacin can cause cartilage damage in immature animals. Ornidazole carries potential risks to the fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Contraindicated.  Both drugs are excreted in breast milk, with potential risks to the infant.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Ofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Ornidazole damages microbial DNA.
