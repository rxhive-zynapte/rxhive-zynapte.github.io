## **Usage**

Ofloxacin + Racecadotril is prescribed for the treatment of acute diarrhea, particularly in cases caused by bacterial infections.  It's specifically indicated for diarrhea in children. It is beneficial in managing diarrhea symptoms in patients with gastrointestinal infections caused by susceptible bacterial strains. This combination medication falls under two pharmacological classifications:

* **Ofloxacin:** Fluoroquinolone antibiotic
* **Racecadotril:** Antisecretory agent (Enkephalinase inhibitor)


Ofloxacin works by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair. This action prevents bacterial growth and helps clear the infection. Racecadotril, on the other hand, reduces the secretion of water and electrolytes into the intestine by inhibiting enkephalinase, an enzyme that breaks down enkephalins. This helps decrease the frequency and volume of diarrheal stools without affecting normal gut motility.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for the combination itself.  However, it's available under various brand names, some of which include:

* Oflonida-R Oral Suspension
* Enuff-O Dry Syp
* Racejan O Syrup
* Oshin Roz Oral Suspension
* Mapcin RD Oral Suspension
* Lee Dott-RC Oral Suspension Strawberry
* Oflover R Oral Suspension
* OFLARGE OR
* POLO-R
* Raceril O Oral Suspension
* Offry OR Suspension


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

Ofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes crucial for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, and repair. This inhibition prevents bacterial growth and helps to eliminate the infection. Racecadotril is an enkephalinase inhibitor. Enkephalinase is responsible for the degradation of enkephalins in the small intestine. Enkephalins stimulate water and electrolyte secretion in the intestine. By inhibiting enkephalinase, Racecadotril increases local concentrations of enkephalins, which reduce the hypersecretion of water and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen, thus mitigating diarrhea. It is considered a safer and better-tolerated antidiarrheal alternative to loperamide. This combined action of these two drugs helps treat diarrhea effectively.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Ofloxacin:** Well-absorbed orally, achieving peak plasma concentrations within 1-2 hours. It is widely distributed throughout the body. Primarily excreted by the kidneys, with some metabolism occurring in the liver.
* **Racecadotril:** Rapidly absorbed after oral administration, and its active metabolite, thiorphan, reaches peak plasma levels in approximately 1.5 hours. It is hydrolyzed to thiorphan, its active metabolite. Thiorphan is primarily eliminated through the kidneys. 


**Elimination Pathways:**

* Ofloxacin: Primarily renal excretion, some hepatic metabolism.
* Racecadotril: Renal excretion of the active metabolite, thiorphan.

## **Dosage**

Dosage information for Ofloxacin + Racecadotril specifically is limited. Available information focuses on the individual components, especially Racecadotril. The combination is available as a suspension intended mainly for pediatric use.  Always follow the prescribed dosage and consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosage based on the child's age, weight, and specific condition.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Dosage information for adults is limited as this combination is mainly used in children. Consulting a physician is necessary for individual cases.

#### **Children:**

This drug has mainly been studied and used in children. It's administered orally three times daily until the frequency of loose/watery stools return to normal, and in most cases, the infection is treated as well. Racecadotril dosage is generally based on weight:

* Infants (>3 months) <9 kg: 10 mg three times daily.
* 9-<13 kg: 20 mg three times daily.
* 13-27 kg: 30 mg three times daily.
* >27 kg: 60 mg three times daily.
* Ofloxacin is typically dosed at 50mg three times daily for children.

Maximum duration of treatment: 7 days

#### **Special Cases:**

Because this combination is primarily for children, specific dosing modifications for the elderly or those with renal/hepatic impairment aren't well-defined. Physician consultation is essential. 

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The primary clinical use case is acute diarrhea, typically of bacterial origin, in children. Specific dosage modifications for settings like ICU or emergency situations are not defined.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Consult a healthcare professional to adjust the dosage based on individual patient-specific factors. Close monitoring is necessary for patients with kidney or liver problems.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Headache
* Dry mouth
* Sleepiness
* Fatigue
* Dizziness
* Skin rash

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Allergic reactions (including angioedema, bronchospasm)
* Seizures (with overdose)
* Tendon disorders (rare but serious, associated with fluoroquinolones)
* Steven-Johnson syndrome
* Visual impairment
* Hearing loss


### **Long-Term Effects**

Limited data exist on long-term effects.  However, prolonged use of fluoroquinolones like ofloxacin can rarely lead to tendon issues, peripheral neuropathy, and other serious side effects.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

ADRs requiring urgent medical attention include severe allergic reactions, seizures, and severe gastrointestinal issues.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to ofloxacin, racecadotril, or any fluoroquinolone.
* History of tendon disorders related to fluoroquinolone use.
* Epilepsy or other seizure disorders.
* Conditions causing QT prolongation.
* G6PD deficiency.
* Pregnancy (use with extreme caution and only if absolutely necessary).
* Breastfeeding (consult a doctor before use).


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Antacids:** Reduce ofloxacin absorption.
* **Sucralfate:** Reduces ofloxacin absorption.
* **Antiarrhythmics (Class IA and III):**  May prolong QT interval.
* **Tricyclic Antidepressants:** Risk of CNS effects.
* **Antipsychotics:** Risk of CNS effects.
* **Macrolides:** Potential QT prolongation.
* **Anticoagulants:** May enhance anticoagulant effects.
* **Antidiabetics:** May affect blood sugar levels.
* **NSAIDs:** May increase seizure risk.
* **Theophylline:** May elevate theophylline levels.
* **Corticosteroids:**  May increase risk of tendon rupture.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Avoid use during pregnancy and breastfeeding unless absolutely necessary and under strict medical supervision. Ofloxacin is excreted in breast milk; racecadotril's effects on breastfeeding are not well-established.  The risks to the fetus or infant must be weighed against the benefits to the mother.
