## **Usage**

Omega-3 fatty acid + Tocotrienol is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to support overall health and well-being.  It is often prescribed to address vitamin E deficiency and manage conditions such as heart disease, inflammation,  hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, eye disorders, premenstrual syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, and to improve skin health, hair growth, and cognitive function. It may also be used as an adjunct treatment for asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. It can also be used for congestive cardiac failure, coronary artery disease. Its pharmacological classification can be considered as a combination of a vitamin supplement and an antioxidant.

The mechanism of action involves the combined effects of omega-3 fatty acids and tocotrienols. Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly DHA and EPA, reduce inflammation, improve cell membrane fluidity, and may have positive effects on cardiovascular health. Tocotrienols, a form of vitamin E, act as potent antioxidants, protecting cells from damage caused by free radicals. They can augment cellular energy by facilitating the transport of fatty acids into mitochondria, which are the primary sites of energy production within cells.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination doesn't have a universally recognized International Nonproprietary Name (INN). It's generally referred to as "Omega-3 fatty acid + Tocotrienol." A popular brand name is Evitol.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Omega-3 fatty acids exert anti-inflammatory effects by modulating the production of eicosanoids and cytokines.  They also influence cell membrane fluidity, affecting various cellular processes. Tocotrienols scavenge free radicals, preventing oxidative stress and protecting cell membranes from lipid peroxidation.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Omega-3 fatty acids are absorbed in the small intestine, incorporated into chylomicrons, and transported to the liver. They are then metabolized and incorporated into cell membranes throughout the body. Tocotrienols are absorbed similarly and distributed to various tissues, including adipose tissue. Elimination pathways for both omega-3 fatty acids and tocotrienols involve hepatic metabolism and excretion in bile and urine.

**Mode of Action:** Omega-3 fatty acids influence cell membrane structure and function. They may bind to and activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), affecting gene expression related to lipid metabolism and inflammation. Tocotrienols primarily exert their antioxidant effects by scavenging free radicals and inhibiting lipid peroxidation.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The typical dosage is 1–2 capsules twice daily, or as directed by a physician. The dosage should provide 250–500 mg of combined EPA and DHA per day.

#### **Children:**

Dosage should be determined by a pediatrician and depends on age, weight and specific health considerations.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are generally recommended for elderly patients, but monitoring for potential side effects is important.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary in patients with severe renal impairment.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution should be exercised in patients with hepatic dysfunction, and dosage adjustments may be required.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider interactions with anticoagulant, antiplatelet, anti-diabetic, antihypertensive medications or any chemotherapy treatment when determining dosage for patients with comorbid conditions. 

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of omega-3 fatty acid + tocotrienol in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations isn't established.  Dosage adjustments in such cases should be determined on a case-by-case basis by the attending physician.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be necessary based on patient factors such as renal or hepatic dysfunction, pre-existing medical conditions, or concomitant medications.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, diarrhea, stomach cramps, tiredness, dizziness, blurred vision, headache, eructation, dyspepsia, unpleasant taste, bad breath, burping, stomach ache, and easy bleeding/bruising.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), vitamin E toxicity, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and increased bleeding risk (especially in patients taking anticoagulants or with bleeding disorders).

### **Long-Term Effects**

Limited data are available on long-term effects.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, significant bleeding events.

## **Contraindications**
