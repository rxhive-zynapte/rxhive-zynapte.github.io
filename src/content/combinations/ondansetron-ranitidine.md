## **Usage**

Ondansetron + Ranitidine is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery.  It can also be used to manage symptoms of indigestion and acid reflux, which may exacerbate nausea.  Pharmacologically, this combination is classified as a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (Ondansetron) and a histamine-2 (H2) blocker (Ranitidine). Ondansetron works by blocking serotonin receptors, which prevents serotonin from triggering the vomiting reflex.  Ranitidine reduces stomach acid production, which can help prevent acid reflux and indigestion that could worsen nausea.


## **Alternate Names**

While "Ondansetron + Ranitidine" is the generic name, numerous brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and region. Some examples include brands like "Once-R."

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ondansetron acts centrally and peripherally by selectively antagonizing serotonin 5-HT3 receptors. This prevents serotonin from stimulating the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the brain and vagal afferent nerves in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby suppressing nausea and vomiting. Ranitidine competitively inhibits the action of histamine at H2 receptors of the parietal cells in the stomach, reducing gastric acid secretion.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Ondansetron:** Well absorbed orally. Metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2 enzymes. Excreted in urine and feces.
* **Ranitidine:** Absorbed orally, with bioavailability of around 50%.  Metabolized partially in the liver. Primarily excreted renally as unchanged drug.

**Mode of Action:** Ondansetron's mode of action involves receptor binding at 5-HT3 receptors. It does not exhibit any significant receptor binding at dopamine, histamine, benzodiazepine, or muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Ranitidine competitively binds to H2 receptors in gastric parietal cells, blocking histamine-stimulated acid secretion.

**Elimination:** Ondansetron is eliminated primarily by hepatic metabolism via CYP enzymes, followed by renal excretion. Ranitidine is excreted primarily renally, with some hepatic metabolism.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  A common regimen is Ondansetron 8 mg and Ranitidine 150 mg administered orally or intravenously before chemotherapy, followed by Ondansetron 8 mg every 12 hours. Dosage varies depending on individual patient needs and the medical context.

#### **Children:** Pediatric dosing information for the combination is limited.  Dosage is typically adjusted based on body weight and age, with adjustments in neonates for conditions such as ulcer prophylaxis.  Consultation with a specialist is recommended for precise pediatric dosing.


#### **Special Cases:**
* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary due to age-related decline in renal and hepatic function. Start with a low dose and titrate upwards cautiously.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  For ondansetron, dosage adjustment is usually not required. For ranitidine, dose reduction is recommended for creatinine clearance <50 mL/min.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** For ondansetron, the daily dose should not exceed 8 mg in severe impairment.  Ranitidine dosage may require adjustment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Care should be taken in patients with cardiac conditions, especially with a history of arrhythmias or prolonged QT interval.


### **Clinical Use Cases**
Dosage recommendations for specific clinical cases vary, and decisions are made based on the severity of nausea/vomiting risk, the procedure, and the patient's overall medical condition. Standard protocols often involve administering the combination before, during, or after procedures such as intubation, surgical procedures, and for patients undergoing mechanical ventilation or in intensive care.  In emergency situations, the intravenous route is preferred for rapid action.


### **Dosage Adjustments**  Dose modifications should be considered based on various factors including renal or hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**
Headache, constipation, diarrhea, fatigue, drowsiness, dry mouth, muscle pain, injection site pain, dizziness, flushing of skin.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), irregular heartbeat, seizures, blurred vision, QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, cardiac arrest.

### **Long-Term Effects**
Potential long-term effects of ranitidine use may include vitamin B12 deficiency.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Clinically significant ADRs include severe hypotension with concurrent apomorphine use, serotonin syndrome.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to either ondansetron or ranitidine. Concurrent apomorphine use. Porphyria. Phenylketonuria (for certain formulations containing phenylalanine).

## **Drug Interactions**

Ondansetron metabolism can be decreased by ranitidine.  It may interact with amiodarone, tramadol, clotrimazole, metformin, and other drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes. Ranitidine may interact with drugs such as antacids, ketoconazole, and other H2 receptor antagonists. It's crucial to consider potential CYP450 interactions and the effect of enzyme inducers/inhibitors. Alcohol and nicotine can exacerbate dehydration and reduce the efficacy of Ranitidine.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Ondansetron: While generally considered safe, some studies have suggested a very small increased risk of certain birth defects with first-trimester exposure. Individualized risk-benefit assessment is crucial.  Its excretion in breast milk is minimal.

Ranitidine:  Avoid during pregnancy if possible.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Ondansetron: 5-HT3 receptor antagonist; Ranitidine: H2 receptor antagonist.
* **Side Effects:**  See above.
* **Contraindications:** See above.
* **Drug Interactions:** See above.

## **Popular Combinations**

The combination of ondansetron and ranitidine is itself a popular combination for preventing and managing nausea and vomiting, particularly in perioperative and chemotherapy settings.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Screen for allergies, assess liver and kidney function, and cardiac history, especially QT prolongation risk.
* **Specific Populations:** Consider potential risks and benefits for pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, children, and the elderly.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Advise patients to avoid driving or operating machinery if drowsiness or dizziness occurs. Limit alcohol intake.
