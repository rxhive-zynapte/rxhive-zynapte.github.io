## **Usage**

This topical medication is primarily prescribed for infected skin lesions and ulcers.  It aids in wound healing after surgical procedures by preventing microbial contamination.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Ornidazole: Antiprotozoal, antibacterial
* Povidone Iodine: Antiseptic
* Sucralfate: Mucosal protectant, anti-ulcer

**Mechanism of Action:**

* **Ornidazole:** Disrupts DNA and other cellular components of anaerobic bacteria and protozoa.
* **Povidone Iodine:** Releases iodine, which oxidizes microbial proteins, causing cell death across a broad spectrum of microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa).
* **Sucralfate:** Forms a protective barrier over the ulcer or wound, protecting it from further irritation and promoting healing.


## **Alternate Names** 

Various brand names exist, including Wounsol Ointment, Povistop Ointment, Puradine Oz Ointment, Xtracare Ointment, Zeroseptic SF Ointment, and Zyodine Ointment.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The combined action of ornidazole (antibacterial and antiprotozoal), povidone-iodine (antiseptic), and sucralfate (mucosal protectant) provides a comprehensive approach to treating infected wounds.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily topical action. Systemic absorption of iodine may occur, especially with prolonged use on large areas. Ornidazole can be absorbed systemically to some extent.  Hepatic metabolism and renal excretion are involved.  

**Mode of Action:**  See "Mechanism of Action" above.  The drugs do not have specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation properties relevant to their topical use for wound healing.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal and hepatic.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer to the cleansed affected area two to three times daily, or as directed by the physician.

#### **Children:** Use in children below 12 years of age is generally not recommended unless specifically prescribed by a physician. Pediatric dosage should be determined by the physician based on the child's age and weight.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required, but monitor thyroid function with prolonged use.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; monitor renal function. Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution; monitor liver function. Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Particular caution in patients with thyroid disorders (due to iodine content), diabetes, or other metabolic disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  Dosing for these scenarios is determined by the physician on a case-by-case basis:

* **Intubation:** Not applicable (topical use).
* **Surgical Procedures:** May be used pre- and post-operatively for wound care.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not applicable (topical use).
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** As directed by the physician for wound management.
* **Emergency Situations:** Not applicable (topical use).

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be necessary based on the individual patient's condition, the severity of the infection, and the response to treatment. Always follow physician guidance.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Local skin reactions (itching, burning, redness, rash)
* Skin discoloration
* Dry Skin

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Allergic reactions
* Thyroid dysfunction (with prolonged use or in susceptible individuals)
* Superficial keratitis (if accidentally applied to eyes)

### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential thyroid issues with prolonged use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) â€“ requires immediate medical intervention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to ornidazole, iodine, povidone, or sucralfate
* Severe liver or kidney impairment
* Thyroid disorders (use with caution)
* Porphyria
* Lithium therapy or radioactive iodine treatment


## **Drug Interactions**

* Other topical antiseptics, antibiotics, or corticosteroids
* Hydrogen peroxide; Neomycin; Hydrocortisone

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Use with caution, especially during the first trimester. Consult a physician.
* **Breastfeeding:** Consult a physician. Iodine can be excreted in breast milk, potentially affecting the infant's thyroid.
