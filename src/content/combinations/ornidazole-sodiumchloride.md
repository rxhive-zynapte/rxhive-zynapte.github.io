## **Usage**

Ornidazole + Sodium Chloride solution for infusion is prescribed for the treatment of infections caused by anaerobic bacteria and certain protozoa. These infections may include:

* **Bacterial Vaginosis:**  A common vaginal infection.
* **Trichomoniasis:** A sexually transmitted infection.
* **Amoebiasis:** An infection caused by the parasite *Entamoeba histolytica*.
* **Giardiasis:** An infection caused by the parasite *Giardia lamblia*.
* **Anaerobic Bacterial Infections:** Infections caused by bacteria that thrive in the absence of oxygen, including septicemia, meningitis, peritonitis, postoperative wound infections, and pelvic infections.
* **Surgical Prophylaxis:** Prevention of postoperative anaerobic bacterial infections, particularly in abdominal and gynecological surgeries.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Antibiotic (nitroimidazole class) and electrolyte replenisher.

**Mechanism of Action:** Ornidazole inhibits DNA synthesis and disrupts the DNA structure of susceptible anaerobic bacteria and protozoa, leading to their death. Sodium Chloride maintains electrolyte balance and hydration.


## **Alternate Names**

Ornidazole is also known as Tiberal.  No alternate names for Sodium Chloride itself, however, the infusion itself may vary such as Ornidazole 0.5% w/v Solution for Infusion, Ornidazole and Sodium Chloride Injection, Orniject Infusion and Ornidazen IV Infusion. Some common brand names for Ornidazole include Dazolic, Ornida, and Tibazole.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ornidazole enters anaerobic microorganisms and undergoes reductive activation, forming reactive metabolites that damage DNA.  This DNA damage prevents bacterial and parasitic replication, ultimately leading to cell death. Sodium Chloride plays a crucial role in maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance, nerve impulse transmission, and muscle function.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Ornidazole is readily absorbed after oral administration, with bioavailability exceeding 90%.  Intravenous administration achieves rapid and complete systemic availability.
* **Metabolism:** Ornidazole is primarily metabolized in the liver to less active metabolites.
* **Elimination:** Ornidazole and its metabolites are mainly excreted in urine, with a small portion eliminated in feces.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Anaerobic infections:** Initial intravenous dose of 0.5 to 1 g, followed by 500 mg every 12 hours for 5 to 10 days. Oral therapy should be substituted as soon as feasible.
* **Surgical prophylaxis:** 1 g intravenous infusion approximately 30 minutes before surgery.
* **Trichomoniasis:** Single dose of 3 tablets (1500 mg) or two tablets daily (1000 mg) for five days.

#### **Children:**

* **Trichomoniasis, Giardiasis, and Amoebiasis:** 25 mg/kg/day in a single dose.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically necessary, but caution is advised in patients with impaired liver function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment is generally not required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments may be necessary in severe hepatic impairment, typically doubling the dosing interval.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments may be needed depending on the specific comorbid condition.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The Ornidazole + Sodium Chloride infusion is specifically indicated for:

* **Surgical Procedures:** Prophylaxis against anaerobic infections.
* **Emergency Situations:** Treatment of severe anaerobic infections.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage modifications may be needed based on individual patient factors, especially in the presence of severe hepatic impairment.  Consult current guidelines for specific recommendations.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Metallic taste
* Dry mouth



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Seizures
* Peripheral neuropathy
* Leukopenia or thrombocytopenia
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic complications are rare with short-term use.  Long-term use may result in peripheral neuropathy.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to ornidazole or other nitroimidazoles.
* First trimester of pregnancy.
* Patients with certain CNS diseases (e.g., epilepsy, multiple sclerosis) should use with extreme caution.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol during and shortly after treatment (disulfiram-like reaction).
* **Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin):** Ornidazole may enhance anticoagulant effects.
* **Vecuronium and Warfarin:** Incompatible for intravenous co-administration.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Contraindicated in the first trimester. Use with caution in the second and third trimesters only if clearly needed.
* **Breastfeeding:** Ornidazole is excreted in breast milk.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for a period after the last dose based on the prescribing information.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Disrupts microbial DNA synthesis and structure.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, headache, dizziness, metallic taste, rarely seizures, peripheral neuropathy.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, first-trimester pregnancy, certain CNS diseases (use with caution).
* **Drug Interactions:** Alcohol, anticoagulants, vecuronium, warfarin.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in the first trimester; breastfeeding not recommended.
* **Dosage:** Varies depending on indication and patient factors; see detailed dosage section.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests, complete blood count (CBC), neurological status.



## **Popular Combinations**

Ornidazole is sometimes combined with ofloxacin or amoxicillin and lansoprazole for specific infections.


## **Precautions**

* Assess for allergies and pre-existing medical conditions before administration.
* Caution in patients with liver disease, alcoholism, epilepsy, or brain damage.
* Exercise care in pregnant or breastfeeding women, as well as in children.
