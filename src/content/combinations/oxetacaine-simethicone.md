## **Usage**

Oxetacaine + Simethicone is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of gastrointestinal discomfort associated with conditions like gastritis, peptic ulcers, esophageal reflux, heartburn, acidity, gas, bloating, and dyspepsia.  It is also used to alleviate menstrual cramps.

**Pharmacological Classification:** This combination product falls under the following classifications:

* **Antacid:** (Magaldrate/Aluminum Hydroxide/Magnesium Hydroxide)
* **Antiflatulent:** (Simethicone)
* **Local Anesthetic:** (Oxetacaine)

**Mechanism of Action:** This combination works through the synergistic action of its components:

* **Magaldrate/Aluminum Hydroxide/Magnesium Hydroxide:** Neutralizes excess stomach acid, thereby increasing the pH level of the stomach contents. This offers protection to the stomach lining and promotes ulcer healing.
* **Simethicone:** Reduces the surface tension of gas bubbles in the digestive tract, facilitating their coalescence into larger bubbles. These larger bubbles are easier to expel through belching or flatulence, easing bloating and discomfort.
* **Oxetacaine:** Acts as a local anesthetic, numbing the lining of the stomach and esophagus to provide relief from pain associated with ulcers or acid irritation.

## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for the combination itself. However, it is marketed under various brand names like Amalcap-O, Rantac MPS LA Suspension, Ulgel-A, Sterichyme Forte, and Z-Cid O, among others.  The individual components may be referred to by their chemical names or other synonyms.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The combined effect of the three components addresses multiple aspects of gastrointestinal distress. The antacids neutralize gastric acid, simethicone reduces gas, and oxetacaine provides local pain relief.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Magaldrate is poorly absorbed systemically. Simethicone is not absorbed at all and is eliminated unchanged in the feces. Oxetacaine is moderately absorbed after oral administration but acts primarily locally.
* **Metabolism:**  Limited information is available regarding the metabolism of oxetacaine.
* **Elimination:**  Magaldrate is mainly eliminated in the feces. Simethicone is eliminated unchanged in the feces. Oxetacaine is likely metabolized, though specific elimination pathways are not well documented.

**Mode of Action:**

* **Magaldrate/Aluminum Hydroxide/Magnesium Hydroxide:** Chemically neutralizes hydrochloric acid in the stomach.
* **Simethicone:**  Physically disrupts the surface tension of gas bubbles.
* **Oxetacaine:**  Blocks voltage-gated sodium channels in nerve cells, preventing pain signal transmission.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The usual dose is 10-30 ml of the suspension, taken 1-2 hours after meals and at bedtime, or as directed by a physician.  The dose may be given up to four times daily as needed. However, dosages should not exceed 500mg of Simethicone daily if self-medicating.

#### **Children:** The combination is generally not recommended for children under 12 years of age. For children above 12, the dosage needs to be determined by a physician based on individual needs. Dosing for simethicone alone in children is as follows:

* **Infants < 2 years:** 20 mg four times daily, as needed, after meals and at bedtime. Maximum dose: 240 mg/day.
* **Children â‰¥ 2 years:** 40 mg four times daily, as needed, after meals and at bedtime. Maximum dose: 480 mg/day.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution; dosage adjustments may be necessary due to potential age-related decline in renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Use cautiously to avoid potential complications such as hypermagnesemia, with close monitoring of renal function and electrolyte levels. Dosage adjustments are necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific adjustments are typically mentioned, but caution is advised.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consult a doctor before using this medication if patients have kidney problems, high blood pressure, or history of GI bleeding.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination is not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its use is primarily limited to outpatient management of dyspepsia, gas, and related gastrointestinal discomfort.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are needed for renal impairment and should be considered for the elderly. Always consult a doctor for appropriate adjustments.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
