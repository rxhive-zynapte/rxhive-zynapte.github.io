## **Usage**

Oxetacaine + Sucralfate is prescribed for the treatment of peptic ulcers (both gastric and duodenal), gastritis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It also provides relief from associated symptoms like heartburn, hyperacidity, and indigestion.  This combination belongs to the pharmacological classifications of gastrointestinal protectants (sucralfate) and local anesthetics (oxetacaine).

Sucralfate works by creating a protective barrier over the ulcer, shielding it from stomach acid, digestive enzymes, and bile salts.  This barrier allows the ulcer to heal. Oxetacaine provides local anesthetic action, numbing the affected area and providing relief from pain associated with ulcers and acid reflux.


## **Alternate Names**

There is no internationally recognized non-proprietary name for the combination product. It's often referred to simply as "Sucralfate + Oxetacaine."  Several brand names exist, depending on the manufacturer and region, including Sucralox, Sucral-O, and Sucraft O.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Sucralfate, a sulfated disaccharide, forms a viscous, paste-like substance in the acidic environment of the stomach (pH < 4). This substance adheres to the ulcer site, creating a physical barrier against further damage from gastric acid, pepsin, and bile.  It also binds to proteins on the ulcer surface (albumin and fibrinogen), forming stable complexes that further reinforce the protective barrier. Additionally, sucralfate may stimulate the production of prostaglandin E2, epidermal growth factor, and gastric mucus, which aid in ulcer healing.

Oxetacaine, an amide local anesthetic, blocks nerve signals in the mucous membranes of the mouth, throat, and esophagus. This action numbs the area, providing rapid relief from pain and discomfort.  Unlike many local anesthetics, oxetacaine ionizes minimally at low pH, allowing it to remain effective in the acidic stomach environment.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Sucralfate is minimally absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The small amount absorbed is excreted primarily in the urine.  Oxetacaine, when administered orally in combination with sucralfate, acts locally and has limited systemic absorption.  The specific metabolic pathways and elimination routes of oxetacaine after oral administration in this combination are not well characterized in available literature.  Further studies are needed to investigate the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) profile of oxetacaine after oral administration with sucralfate.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The usual dose is 10 mL (1 g sucralfate and 20 mg oxetacaine) administered orally four times a day. The suspension should be taken on an empty stomach, typically one hour before meals and at bedtime.  Treatment duration for active duodenal ulcers is usually 4 to 8 weeks or until healing is confirmed by endoscopic examination. Maintenance therapy for healed ulcers may involve a lower dose (e.g., 1 g twice daily).

#### **Children:**

The safety and efficacy of Oxetacaine + Sucralfate have not been established in children below 12 years of age. Administration to children requires careful consideration and should only be done under the supervision of a healthcare professional.



#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Begin with the lowest effective dose and monitor for side effects. Renal function should be assessed periodically.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Use with caution, as sucralfate contains aluminum, which is primarily excreted by the kidneys. Aluminum accumulation can occur in patients with impaired renal function. Dosage adjustments may be needed.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Exercise caution and monitor for side effects.  Limited information is available regarding dosage adjustments in patients with hepatic dysfunction.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Carefully evaluate patients with comorbidities, particularly diabetes (as hyperglycemia has been reported) and conditions affecting swallowing or gastrointestinal motility.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosages mentioned under "Standard Dosage" apply to general clinical uses. Specific dosage adjustments for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not established for this specific combination and should be determined based on individual patient needs and under the guidance of a specialist.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage modifications might be necessary based on renal function, age, and other patient-specific factors. Close monitoring of patients with renal impairment is recommended. Always consult the latest prescribing information and expert guidelines before making any dosage adjustments.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Constipation, dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, and drowsiness are common side effects.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Rarely, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), bezoar formation, severe dizziness, and breathing difficulties can occur.


### **Long-Term Effects**

Aluminum accumulation in patients with renal impairment can occur with prolonged use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs include severe allergic reactions and bezoar formation, requiring immediate medical attention.




## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to sucralfate or oxetacaine is a contraindication. It is also contraindicated in patients with active gastrointestinal bleeding and those with delayed gastric emptying.  Use with caution in patients with renal impairment.


## **Drug Interactions**

Oxetacaine + Sucralfate can interact with several medications, including antacids (especially aluminum- or magnesium-containing antacids), fluoroquinolone antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin), tetracycline antibiotics, anticonvulsants (phenytoin), thyroid medications, digoxin, warfarin, H2 blockers (cimetidine, ranitidine), and several other drugs. Consult a comprehensive drug interaction database for detailed information. It is essential to separate the administration of sucralfate from other medications by at least two hours.  Alcohol and tobacco can worsen underlying gastrointestinal conditions and may interfere with the efficacy of the medication.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Oxetacaine + Sucralfate is classified as pregnancy category B. Consult a doctor before use during pregnancy.  Limited information is available on its safety during breastfeeding. It's advisable to consult a physician to assess the benefit-risk ratio before administering it to lactating women.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Sucralfate forms a protective barrier over ulcers; oxetacaine provides local anesthetic action.
* **Side Effects:** Constipation, dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, drowsiness.  Rarely, allergic reactions and bezoar formation.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, active GI bleeding, delayed gastric emptying.
* **Drug Interactions:** Numerous drug interactions; separate administration by at least two hours.  Alcohol and tobacco should be avoided.
