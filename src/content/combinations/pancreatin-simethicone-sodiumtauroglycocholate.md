## **Usage**

- This combination medication is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of indigestion, dyspepsia, and other related gastrointestinal issues. These issues may include abdominal discomfort, bloating, fullness, flatulence (gas), and fatty food intolerance.  It is also used for patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to conditions like chronic pancreatitis or cystic fibrosis.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Digestive aid and anti-foaming agent combination.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This drug combines three active ingredients that work synergistically to improve digestion and reduce gas:
    - *Pancreatin:*  A mixture of digestive enzymes (amylase, lipase, and protease) that break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, respectively.
    - *Simethicone:* An anti-foaming agent that decreases the surface tension of gas bubbles in the GI tract, promoting their coalescence and expulsion.
    - *Sodium Tauroglycocholate:* A bile salt that emulsifies fats, making them more accessible to pancreatic lipase for enhanced digestion and absorption.


## **Alternate Names**

- Dizec (brand name in some regions)
- Pancreatin/Simethicone/Sodium Tauroglycocholate combination


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Pancreatin facilitates the digestion of food, simethicone reduces gas, and sodium tauroglycocholate emulsifies fats to improve absorption.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - *Absorption:* Each component is absorbed orally and exerts its action within the gastrointestinal tract.
    - *Metabolism:* Pancreatin enzymes are broken down in the GI tract. Simethicone is not absorbed and is eliminated unchanged in the feces. Sodium tauroglycocholate undergoes enterohepatic circulation.
    - *Elimination:* Primarily via feces (simethicone and unabsorbed components); sodium tauroglycocholate after enterohepatic circulation.
- **Mode of Action:**  Pancreatin enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. Simethicone reduces the surface tension of gas bubbles. Sodium tauroglycocholate emulsifies fats.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Not applicable to this combination.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily fecal elimination for all components.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- One tablet orally with meals, three times a day.

#### **Children:**

- Dosage should be determined by a physician based on age and weight. Generally, lower doses are recommended.
