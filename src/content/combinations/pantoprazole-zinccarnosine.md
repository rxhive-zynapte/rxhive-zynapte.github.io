## **Usage**

- This combination is prescribed for acidity, heartburn, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and gastric ulcers. It combines the acid-suppressing effects of pantoprazole with the mucosal protective and ulcer-healing properties of zinc carnosine.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) + Nutritional Supplement (with demonstrated pharmacological activity)
- **Mechanism of Action:** Pantoprazole inhibits the H+/K+-ATPase proton pump in parietal cells within the stomach lining, thus reducing gastric acid secretion. Zinc carnosine stabilizes the mucosal lining integrity, promotes the healing of ulcers, and potentially demonstrates some antimicrobial activity against *H. pylori*.

## **Alternate Names**

- Proloc-XT
- Gastrozin + pantoprazole (combination therapy seen in clinical trials)
- PepZin GIÂ® (brand name for zinc carnosine)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Pantoprazole suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the H+/K+-ATPase pumps in parietal cells.  Zinc carnosine exerts local effects on the gastric mucosa, promoting healing and protecting against damage. Systemic effects of zinc carnosine are minimal due to its poor absorption.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - *Pantoprazole:* After oral administration, it is absorbed into the bloodstream and metabolized primarily by the liver (CYP450 enzymes). It is excreted primarily in the urine.
    - *Zinc Carnosine:* It has poor systemic absorption. It slowly dissociates in the gastrointestinal tract, allowing for sustained local action. Zinc is absorbed minimally, with the majority excreted in feces. Carnosine is metabolized into histidine and beta-alanine.
- **Mode of Action:** Pantoprazole irreversibly binds to the H+/K+-ATPase pump, blocking the final step of acid secretion. Zinc carnosine exerts its effects through multiple mechanisms, including antioxidant activity, wound healing promotion, and potential antimicrobial effects against *H. pylori*.
- **Elimination Pathways:**
    - *Pantoprazole:* Primarily renal excretion.
    - *Zinc Carnosine:* Primarily fecal excretion (unabsorbed zinc); carnosine metabolites are further metabolized or excreted in urine.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Pantoprazole: 40 mg once daily before a meal for up to 8 weeks for GERD-related erosive esophagitis.
- Zinc Carnosine: 75 mg twice daily (providing 16 mg of elemental zinc twice daily) or 150 mg once daily.  A combined formulation may be available, simplifying administration.

#### **Children:**

- The combined formulation is generally not recommended for children under 12.
- Pantoprazole: For children 5 years and older with erosive esophagitis, dosing is weight-based: 20 mg once daily for 15-39 kg and 40 mg once daily for 40 kg or greater, for up to 8 weeks. For children younger than 5 years, a physician must determine dosage.
- Zinc carnosine is not generally recommended for children under 12.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Pantoprazole is usually prescribed at the standard adult dose with careful monitoring. Zinc carnosine dosage is typically reduced to 100 mg daily due to potentially reduced digestive function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments for pantoprazole are typically not necessary.  Monitor zinc levels with prolonged zinc carnosine use.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Close monitoring is required for pantoprazole, and dose adjustments may be necessary.  Zinc carnosine use should be monitored by a healthcare professional.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider potential drug interactions and adjust accordingly.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is not commonly used in intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its primary use is outpatient management of GERD and peptic ulcers. Pantoprazole can be administered intravenously in hospital settings for conditions requiring acid suppression, but zinc carnosine is typically given orally.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be needed based on factors such as renal or hepatic function, metabolic disorders, concomitant medications, and treatment response.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Headache
- Diarrhea
- Nausea
- Abdominal pain
- Flatulence

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- *Pantoprazole:*  *Clostridium difficile* infection, low magnesium levels (with prolonged use), cutaneous lupus erythematosus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
- *Zinc Carnosine:* Copper deficiency (with prolonged high doses).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- *Pantoprazole:* Increased risk of osteoporosis-related fractures,  vitamin B12 deficiency, fundic gland polyps.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Report any suspected ADRs promptly.


## **Contraindications**

- Known hypersensitivity to either component.
- Pantoprazole should not be co-administered with rilpivirine.

## **Drug Interactions**

- *Pantoprazole:*  May affect absorption of drugs dependent on gastric pH (e.g., ketoconazole, iron salts). Can interact with drugs metabolized by CYP450 enzymes (e.g., warfarin, phenytoin). May increase serum levels of methotrexate.
- *Zinc Carnosine:*  High doses of zinc can interfere with copper absorption.  May interact with certain antibiotics (e.g., tetracyclines, quinolones).
- Food and lifestyle factors: Alcohol, smoking, and grapefruit juice may interact with pantoprazole.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Pantoprazole:  Pregnancy Category C. Use with caution during pregnancy only if clearly needed.
- Zinc Carnosine:  Safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not well established. Consult a healthcare professional.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Pantoprazole inhibits gastric acid secretion; zinc carnosine protects and heals the gastric mucosa.
- **Side Effects:**  See above.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:** See above.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; consult a healthcare professional.
- **Dosage:**  See above.

## **Popular Combinations**

This combination itself is a common pairing utilized clinically for GERD and ulcer treatment, benefiting from the synergistic actions of acid suppression and mucosal protection.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess for allergies, pre-existing conditions, and concomitant medications.
- **Specific Populations:**  Consult a healthcare professional before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding, or in pediatric and elderly patients.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Advise patients on lifestyle modifications, such as dietary adjustments, stress management, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.
