## **Usage**

This combination medication is used to relieve symptoms associated with the common cold and allergies, such as runny nose, sneezing, watery eyes, nasal congestion, headache, fever, body aches, and sore throat.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This product is a combination of:

* **Analgesic and Antipyretic:** (Paracetamol/Acetaminophen)
* **Decongestant:** (Phenylephrine)
* **Antihistamine:** (Triprolidine)

**Mechanism of Action:**  This combination targets multiple pathways to address various symptoms. Paracetamol reduces fever and pain by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, constricts blood vessels in the nasal mucosa, reducing swelling and congestion. Triprolidine, a first-generation antihistamine, competes with histamine for H1-receptor sites, thus mitigating allergic symptoms.



## **Alternate Names**

This combination is often referred to as "Paracetamol/Phenylephrine/Triprolidine" or Acetaminophen/Phenylephrine/Triprolidine (using the US adopted name for Paracetamol). Brand names vary regionally and internationally but can include Coriza, Endrip, Recofast Plus, and formulations within broader cold and flu relief brands like Codral and Mucinex.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Paracetamol exerts its analgesic and antipyretic effects through the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, primarily in the central nervous system. Phenylephrine, as an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist, causes vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa, reducing congestion. Triprolidine, an H1 receptor antagonist, blocks the effects of histamine, relieving allergic symptoms like sneezing, rhinorrhea, and itching.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Paracetamol is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 30-60 minutes. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine. Phenylephrine is less well absorbed orally.  It undergoes first-pass metabolism in the gut and liver.  Triprolidine is well-absorbed orally and is also metabolized in the liver. All three components are primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.

**Mode of Action:** Paracetamol's precise mechanism remains partially understood, although it is known to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, specifically COX-2 in the central nervous system, which are involved in prostaglandin synthesis.  Phenylephrine acts directly on alpha-1 adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle in the nasal mucosa, leading to vasoconstriction. Triprolidine competitively binds to H1 histamine receptors, preventing histamine from binding and exerting its effects.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Paracetamol is primarily metabolized by the liver, with glucuronidation and sulfation being major pathways.  A small portion is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, forming a potentially toxic metabolite. Phenylephrine is primarily metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO). Triprolidine is metabolized in the liver.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  One or two tablets/capsules every 4-6 hours as needed. Do not exceed the maximum daily dose as specified in the product labeling, usually around eight tablets in 24 hours.  Liquid formulations require careful measurement according to the package directions.

#### **Children:** Dosage for children should be determined by a pediatrician based on the childâ€™s age and weight. This combination is generally not recommended for young children.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Start with a lower dose and monitor for adverse effects. Dose adjustments may be needed due to age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution and consider dosage reduction due to potential drug accumulation and increased risk of hepatotoxicity.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Precaution is advised in patients with heart disease, hypertension, glaucoma, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, and prostatic hypertrophy.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

This combination is intended for short-term symptomatic relief of cold and allergy symptoms. It is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, the ICU, or emergency situations.  In such cases, individual components may be used separately and under strict medical supervision.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage modification might be required based on patient-specific factors, including renal and hepatic function, comorbidities, and concomitant medications. Consult product labeling and/or a healthcare professional for specific guidance.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, constipation, restlessness, insomnia, nervousness.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), difficulty breathing, hallucinations, seizures, rapid or irregular heartbeat, severe dizziness.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic use of this combination is generally not recommended.  Long-term use of paracetamol at high doses can increase the risk of liver damage.  Chronic use of phenylephrine can lead to rebound congestion.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any severe or persistent side effects should be considered as potential ADRs and warrant immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any component of the medication.
* Monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) use within the past 14 days.
* Severe liver disease.
* Severe renal impairment.
* Uncontrolled hyperthyroidism.
* Closed-angle glaucoma.


## **Drug Interactions**

* MAOIs, alcohol, sedatives, tricyclic antidepressants, other antihistamines, decongestants, beta-blockers, digoxin, warfarin, and some antibiotics. Always review a patient's medication history for potential interactions.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been definitively established.  The individual components have varying safety profiles.  Consult a physician before using this medication during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Paracetamol inhibits prostaglandin synthesis; phenylephrine acts as an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist; triprolidine is an H1 receptor antagonist.
