## **Usage**

Paracetamol + Phenylephrine is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of common cold and flu symptoms, including fever, headache, body aches, sore throat, and nasal congestion.  It belongs to the pharmacological classes of analgesics, antipyretics, and nasal decongestants. The combination provides both pain relief and reduction of nasal swelling.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Paracetamol + Phenylephrine" is the standard generic name, variations may exist internationally.  Brand names include "Max Strength Cold & Flu Relief" and "Restocin," among others. COL-COL is another brand name available.

## **How It Works**

**Paracetamol:**  Exerts its analgesic and antipyretic effects through central mechanisms, primarily by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the brain, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, which plays a key role in pain and fever. Its pharmacokinetics involves rapid absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, hepatic metabolism primarily via glucuronidation and sulfation, and renal excretion.

**Phenylephrine:**  Acts as a nasal decongestant by stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors in the vascular smooth muscle of the nasal mucosa. This leads to vasoconstriction, reducing nasal blood flow and relieving congestion. It undergoes first-pass metabolism and has limited oral bioavailability.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One sachet or two tablets/capsules every 4 to 6 hours, as needed. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 4 sachets or 8 tablets/capsules in a 24-hour period.  Do not take for more than 3 days for fever and 5 days for pain without consulting a doctor.

#### **Children:**

Not recommended for children under 16 years of age for most formulations. Specific formulations exist for younger children, consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosage.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Standard adult dose may be suitable, but caution is advised due to potential age-related decline in organ function. Dose reduction or prolonged dosing interval may be necessary for frail or immobile elderly patients.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment is necessary. In severe renal impairment, the dosing interval should be increased to at least 8 hours.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment or increased dosing interval may be necessary. Use with caution in patients with severe liver disease, including alcoholic liver disease.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution should be exercised in patients with diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, or prostatic hyperplasia.  Consult a physician for individualised dosing.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specialized settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations should be determined on a case-by-case basis by the attending physician.  The use of Paracetamol + Phenylephrine in these contexts is generally not standard practice.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on patient-specific factors, such as renal or hepatic impairment, and should be made by a physician.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, dizziness, headache, nervousness, insomnia, difficulty in passing urine, skin rashes, and allergic reactions.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Severe skin reactions, blood disorders (e.g., thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis), and hepatotoxicity with excessive doses of paracetamol. Hypertensive crisis, though rare, can occur with phenylephrine.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic complications from prolonged use are rare, but potential liver damage with chronic paracetamol overuse is a concern.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs include hypersensitivity reactions, liver failure (with paracetamol overdose), and severe hypertension (with phenylephrine).


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to paracetamol or phenylephrine, severe liver disease, severe heart conditions, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, and concurrent or recent use of MAOIs.  Use with caution or avoid in pregnancy and breastfeeding.


## **Drug Interactions**

MAOIs, tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers, other decongestants, warfarin, and alcohol. Consult a doctor about potential interactions with other prescribed medications.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use is generally not recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential risks to the fetus or infant. Safer alternatives may be available. Consult a doctor before use.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Paracetamol inhibits COX enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis; phenylephrine stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, headache, dizziness, insomnia, allergic reactions, rare but serious hepatotoxicity and hypertensive crisis.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe liver/heart disease, hypertension, MAOI use.
* **Drug Interactions:** MAOIs, tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers, alcohol.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution or avoid.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 1 sachet/2 tablets every 4-6 hours, not exceeding 4 sachets/8 tablets in 24 hours. Children: Not generally recommended under 16.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests with prolonged or high-dose paracetamol use; blood pressure monitoring in patients at risk of hypertension.


## **Popular Combinations**

Paracetamol is often combined with other drugs like chlorpheniramine maleate and caffeine in cold and flu remedies to provide broader symptom relief.


## **Precautions**

Screen patients for allergies, metabolic disorders, and organ dysfunction. Exercise caution in specific populations, especially pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, children, and the elderly. Advise patients on lifestyle considerations like avoiding alcohol and potential driving impairment due to drowsiness.
