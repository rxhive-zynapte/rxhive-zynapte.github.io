## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for short-term pain relief and inflammation reduction.  It combines the analgesic and antipyretic properties of paracetamol with the anti-inflammatory action of piroxicam. The drug is frequently used to manage conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other musculoskeletal disorders. It's also prescribed post-operatively and after dental procedures.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Paracetamol: Analgesic, Antipyretic
* Piroxicam: Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID)

**Mechanism of Action:** Paracetamol's analgesic and antipyretic mechanisms are not fully understood but are believed to involve inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the central nervous system, reducing prostaglandin synthesis. Piroxicam inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, decreasing prostaglandin production throughout the body and minimizing inflammation and pain.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Paracetamol + Piroxicam" is the standard generic name, it may be listed as "Acetaminophen + Piroxicam" in some regions. Several brand names market this combined formulation, and it is advisable to consult local pharmaceutical resources to identify available brands for Indian practitioners and patients.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Paracetamol exerts its analgesic and antipyretic effects centrally. Piroxicam, as an NSAID, primarily acts peripherally by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. This dual action reduces the production of prostaglandins, inflammatory mediators that cause pain, fever, and swelling.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Both drugs are absorbed well orally.  Paracetamol is metabolized in the liver, primarily by glucuronidation and sulfation, with a minor pathway involving CYP enzymes. Piroxicam undergoes hepatic metabolism, primarily by CYP2C9, forming inactive hydroxylated metabolites.  Both are eliminated primarily through renal excretion.

**Mode of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Paracetamol acts centrally, possibly through COX inhibition and modulation of endocannabinoid pathways.  Piroxicam inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes peripherally, reducing prostaglandin synthesis.

**Elimination Pathways:** Paracetamol is excreted renally after hepatic metabolism.  Piroxicam is predominantly eliminated through hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The general adult dose of combined Paracetamol + Piroxicam tablets typically involves 500mg Paracetamol taken concurrently with 20mg of Piroxicam once daily.  Specific dosing should be determined based on patient response and clinical evaluation. The maximum recommended daily dose of paracetamol is 4g, and the maximum recommended daily dose of piroxicam is 20 mg.


#### **Children:**  The combined formulation of Paracetamol + Piroxicam is generally *not* recommended for children due to safety concerns, especially with piroxicam's potential gastrointestinal and renal side effects. Specific pediatric doses and safety recommendations should be validated by specialized pediatric practitioners if such a prescription is considered. Individual components of the combination might be appropriate for pediatric use.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start at the lower end of the dosing range due to age-related decline in organ function. Careful monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce piroxicam dosage or avoid use in severe renal dysfunction.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Reduce paracetamol and piroxicam dosage or avoid use in severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Careful evaluation is required in patients with conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or bleeding disorders due to increased risk of complications.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combined Paracetamol + Piroxicam formulation does not have specific established dosages for specialized medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use. The components of the combination may be administered according to the condition, however, the combination formulation should be generally avoided in such settings, and alternative pain management strategies might be more appropriate.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal or hepatic function, comorbidities, and concurrent medications.  Consultation with a specialist might be appropriate for tailored dosage modifications.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Gastrointestinal: Nausea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, constipation.
* Central Nervous System: Headache, dizziness.
* Skin: Rash, itching.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Gastrointestinal:  GI bleeding, ulceration, perforation.
* Cardiovascular: Myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension.
* Renal: Acute renal failure.
* Hepatic:  Hepatotoxicity.
* Hematologic:  Thrombocytopenia.
* Hypersensitivity:  Anaphylaxis.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic use of piroxicam can increase the risk of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal complications. Long-term use of high dose paracetamol may increase the risk of renal complications.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Severe adverse reactions including GI bleeding, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, anaphylaxis require immediate medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to paracetamol or piroxicam.
* History of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease.
* Active peptic ulcer or GI bleeding.
* Severe hepatic impairment.
* Severe renal impairment.
* Third trimester of pregnancy.
* Peri-operative pain in coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

## **Drug Interactions**

* Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin): Increased risk of bleeding.
* Antihypertensives:  May reduce the effectiveness of antihypertensives.
* Corticosteroids:  Increased risk of GI ulceration.
* Lithium:  Piroxicam may increase lithium levels.
* Methotrexate: Increased toxicity of methotrexate.
* Other NSAIDs: Increased risk of GI adverse effects.
* Alcohol: Increased risk of GI bleeding.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy:** Piroxicam is contraindicated in the third trimester. Use in the first and second trimesters should be avoided unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Paracetamol is generally considered safe during pregnancy, but use should be minimized.

**Breastfeeding:** Piroxicam is present in breast milk and should be avoided during breastfeeding if possible. The amount of paracetamol excreted in breast milk is minimal and it is generally considered safe in breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Paracetamol acts centrally (analgesic/antipyretic); Piroxicam inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 peripherally (analgesic/anti-inflammatory).
* **Side Effects:**  GI upset, headache, dizziness, rash. Serious: GI bleeding, cardiovascular events, renal/hepatic dysfunction.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, active peptic ulcer, severe hepatic/renal impairment, third trimester of pregnancy.
* **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, antihypertensives, corticosteroids, lithium, methotrexate, alcohol.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid piroxicam. Paracetamol generally safe, minimize use.
* **Dosage:** Adult: Paracetamol 500mg + Piroxicam 20mg once daily (adjust as needed). Not recommended for children.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, liver function, signs of GI bleeding, blood pressure.

## **Popular Combinations**

The combined paracetamol + piroxicam formulation is itself a popular combination utilized for its synergistic effects on pain and inflammation. Clinicians must avoid prescribing it along with other NSAIDS.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:**  Assess for allergies, hepatic/renal function, GI history.
* **Specific Populations:** Avoid or adjust in pregnancy/breastfeeding, children, elderly.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Limit alcohol consumption, monitor for interactions with diet.
