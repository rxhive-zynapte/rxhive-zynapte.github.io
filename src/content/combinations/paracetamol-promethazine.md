## **Usage**

Paracetamol + Promethazine is prescribed for the short-term symptomatic relief of pain and discomfort associated with common cold and flu, including headache, fever, body aches, and nasal congestion. Additionally, it may be used to treat allergic conditions like hay fever and urticaria, as well as nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness.  It is also sometimes used as a sedative for insomnia.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This combination drug falls under multiple classifications due to the presence of two active ingredients:

* **Paracetamol:** Analgesic (pain reliever) and Antipyretic (fever reducer)
* **Promethazine:** Antihistamine (H1 receptor antagonist) and Sedative-Hypnotic and Antiemetic.

**Mechanism of Action:**

* **Paracetamol:** Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis in the central nervous system, which reduces pain and fever.  Its exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it appears to act primarily on cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the brain and spinal cord.
* **Promethazine:** Competes with histamine for H1-receptor sites, reducing allergic symptoms. Additionally, it has an anticholinergic effect that contributes to its sedative and antiemetic properties.


## **Alternate Names** 

This combination drug is sometimes referred to as Paracetamol/Promethazine or Promethazine/Paracetamol.


**Brand Names:**  Some examples of Brand Names include: (Please be aware that brand names can vary regionally)
* Phenergan with Codeine (some formulations)
* Night Nurse (some formulations)
* Painstop Night-Time Pain Reliever (some formulations)


## **How It Works**


**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Paracetamol:** Reduces fever and pain by inhibiting COX enzymes in the CNS, and minimally peripherally.
* **Promethazine:** Antagonizes H1 receptors, leading to a decrease in allergic symptoms.  It also possesses anticholinergic, sedative, and antiemetic properties through central nervous system depression and muscarinic receptor blockade.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Paracetamol:**  Rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Metabolized primarily in the liver, mainly by glucuronidation and sulfation, and excreted in the urine. A minor pathway involves hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP2E1 and CYP3A4) metabolism to a reactive intermediate, NAPQI. This is detoxified by glutathione.
* **Promethazine:** Well absorbed after oral administration. Metabolized in the liver, primarily via CYP2D6, and excreted in urine and feces.

**Mode of Action:**

* **Paracetamol:** Primarily inhibits COX enzymes, decreasing prostaglandin production.
* **Promethazine:** Competitive antagonist at H1 receptors.  It blocks muscarinic acetylcholine receptors contributing to its antiemetic and sedative effects.


**Elimination Pathways:**

* **Paracetamol:** Primarily renal excretion.
* **Promethazine:** Primarily hepatic metabolism (CYP2D6) with renal and fecal excretion.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The typical adult dose is 500-1000 mg of Paracetamol and 12.5-25 mg of Promethazine, usually taken at bedtime. As of today, 2025-02-16 it is recommended not to exceed a maximum daily dose of 4000mg of Paracetamol, from all sources.

#### **Children:**

Promethazine is generally not recommended for children under 2 years of age. For children older than 2 years, the dose should be carefully calculated based on the child's weight and age, and only administered under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  This is crucial due to the risk of respiratory depression.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and monitor closely due to increased sensitivity to side effects, particularly drowsiness and confusion.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dose adjustment might be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Paracetamol dosage should be reduced, and Promethazine should be used with caution due to the risk of further liver damage.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with respiratory diseases (e.g., asthma, COPD), cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The Paracetamol + Promethazine combination is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU care.  It may be used for short-term pain and symptom relief associated with mild to moderate post-operative discomfort.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary based on patient-specific factors such as renal or hepatic dysfunction, age, and body weight. Always use the lowest effective dose.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention, nausea, and restlessness.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (e.g., skin rash, itching, swelling), difficulty breathing, abnormal heart rhythms, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), and severe liver damage (with Paracetamol overdose).


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Tardive dyskinesia (with prolonged Promethazine use).


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), agranulocytosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to paracetamol or promethazine, severe respiratory depression, acute asthma attack, comatose state, use of MAOIs within the past two weeks, children under 2 years of age.



## **Drug Interactions**

Alcohol, CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids), anticholinergics (e.g., atropine), MAOIs, and other medications metabolized by CYP2D6.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

This combination is generally avoided during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, due to potential risks to the fetus. The use of paracetamol alone is generally considered safe during breastfeeding; however, promethazine should be used with caution.
