## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the temporary relief of symptoms associated with the common cold, flu, and allergies, such as:

*   Nasal congestion
*   Runny nose
*   Sneezing
*   Watery eyes
*   Headache
*   Fever
*   Body aches and pains
*   Sinus pain

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This drug is a combination product containing:

*   Paracetamol: Analgesic and antipyretic
*   Pseudoephedrine: Decongestant (sympathomimetic amine)
*   Triprolidine: Antihistamine (first-generation H1 receptor antagonist)

**Mechanism of Action:**

*   **Paracetamol:** Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis in the central nervous system, reducing fever and pain.
*   **Pseudoephedrine:** Acts as a nasal decongestant by constricting blood vessels in the nasal mucosa, reducing swelling and congestion.
*   **Triprolidine:** Blocks the effects of histamine, reducing allergic symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes.



## **Alternate Names**

This combination medication is often referred to as:

* Acetaminophen + Pseudoephedrine + Triprolidine (using the US name for paracetamol).

**Brand Names:**

Examples of brand names include:

*   Sudafed Sinus + Pain Relief Day & Night
*   Codral Original Day & Night
*   Sudafed Sinus + Allergy & Pain Relief


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

*   **Paracetamol:** Reduces fever by acting on the hypothalamic heat-regulating center and alleviates pain by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.
*   **Pseudoephedrine:**  Stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors in the nasal mucosa, causing vasoconstriction and reducing nasal congestion. Also has weak beta-adrenergic agonist activity.
*   **Triprolidine:** Competes with histamine for H1 receptor sites, reducing the effects of histamine release.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Paracetamol:** Rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Metabolized in the liver, primarily by glucuronidation and sulfation. Excreted in the urine.
*   **Pseudoephedrine:** Well-absorbed orally. Partially metabolized in the liver. Excreted primarily in the urine.
*   **Triprolidine:** Well-absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver. Excreted in the urine.

**Elimination Pathways:**

*   Primarily renal excretion for all three components.
*   Hepatic metabolism is involved for paracetamol, pseudoephedrine, and triprolidine.
