## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for the short-term relief of moderate to severe acute pain, especially musculoskeletal pain associated with muscle spasms or stiffness, such as back pain, joint pain, and cramps.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Analgesic (Paracetamol, Tramadol), Muscle Relaxant (Thiocolchicoside), Opioid Analgesic (Tramadol), NSAID (Paracetamol).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Paracetamol inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin production and thus pain and fever. Thiocolchicoside acts as a GABA-A receptor antagonist, reducing muscle spasms and spasticity. Tramadol is an opioid analgesic that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, modulating pain signals in the central nervous system.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination. However, the individual components have various synonyms (e.g., acetaminophen for paracetamol).
- **Brand Names:** Several brand names exist depending on the region and manufacturer, including Zach Tablet.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The combination exerts analgesic and muscle relaxant effects through the distinct mechanisms of its components. Paracetamol reduces pain and fever. Thiocolchicoside alleviates muscle spasms and stiffness. Tramadol provides opioid analgesia.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** All three drugs are absorbed orally. Food may delay tramadol absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Paracetamol and tramadol are primarily metabolized in the liver. Thiocolchicoside's metabolism is less well-characterized.
    - **Elimination:** Paracetamol is excreted in urine. Tramadol and its metabolites are excreted mainly in urine, with some fecal excretion. Thiocolchicoside's elimination is not fully understood.
- **Mode of Action:** Paracetamol acts on COX enzymes. Thiocolchicoside interacts with GABA-A receptors. Tramadol inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake.
- **Receptor binding/Enzyme inhibition:** Paracetamol inhibits COX enzymes. Thiocolchicoside is a GABA-A receptor antagonist. Tramadol binds to mu-opioid receptors and inhibits serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake.
- **Elimination pathways:**  Paracetamol and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Tramadol and its metabolites are excreted in the urine, with a small amount in feces. Thiocolchicoside's elimination pathway is not fully characterized.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose:  Two tablets of Paracetamol 325mg/Thiocolchicoside 4mg/Tramadol 37.5mg OR one tablet of Paracetamol 650mg/Thiocolchicoside 8mg/Tramadol 75mg every 4 to 6 hours.
- Maximum daily dose: 8 tablets of the 325mg/4mg/37.5mg combination or 4 tablets of 650mg/8mg/75mg combination (equivalent to 300mg tramadol and 2600mg paracetamol).
- Minimum dosing interval: 6 hours.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for children under 12 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients (over 75 years):**  Tramadol elimination may be delayed. Consider extending the dosage interval based on patient's needs.  Minimum interval between doses should be 6 hours.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  
    - Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 10 mL/min): Not recommended.
    - Moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 10-30 mL/min): Increase dosing interval to 12 hours.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
    - Severe: Contraindicated.
    - Moderate: Carefully consider prolonging dosage interval.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Adjust dosage as needed, especially for those with cardiovascular disease, respiratory problems, or a history of seizures.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- This fixed-dose combination is typically not used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.  In such cases, individual components may be administered separately and titrated as needed.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjust dosage on a case-by-case basis for: Renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders/genetic polymorphisms, elderly patients, and concomitant medications.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
- Nausea, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, weakness, sleepiness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
- Liver damage (paracetamol overdose), respiratory depression (tramadol overdose), seizures, allergic reactions (rash, itching), serotonin syndrome (with serotonergic drugs), adrenal insufficiency.

### **Long-Term Effects:**
- Tolerance to tramadol, physical dependence on tramadol, opioid withdrawal upon discontinuation.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
- Anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hepatotoxicity, respiratory arrest.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to components, acute alcohol poisoning, severe liver/kidney disease, uncontrolled epilepsy, concurrent MAOI use, respiratory depression, acute/severe asthma, pregnancy, breastfeeding, children under 12 years.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Alcohol, carbamazepine, warfarin, SSRIs, triptans, buprenorphine, nalbuphine, pentazocine, MAOIs, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers, opioid analgesics, CNS depressants, anticoagulants, anticonvulsants.
