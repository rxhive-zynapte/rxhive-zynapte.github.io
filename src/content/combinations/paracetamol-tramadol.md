## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Paracetamol + Tramadol is prescribed for the short-term management of moderate to severe acute pain, where the use of both paracetamol and tramadol is deemed necessary by a physician.  It is generally used when other non-opioid pain relief strategies have not been effective or tolerated.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Analgesic (combination of a non-opioid and opioid analgesic)
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination medication provides pain relief through two different mechanisms:
    - **Paracetamol:** Believed to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the central nervous system, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and subsequently decreasing pain and fever. Its exact mechanism of action is not fully understood.
    - **Tramadol:**  A centrally acting analgesic with a dual mechanism of action. It acts as a mu-opioid receptor agonist and also inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, further modulating pain perception.

## **Alternate Names**

- Tramadol/Paracetamol
- Tramadol/Acetaminophen (Acetaminophen is the US name for paracetamol)
- Numerous brand names exist depending on the region and manufacturer. Some common brand names include Zaldiar, Ultracet, and Tramacet.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The combination produces synergistic analgesia through the combined effects on opioid receptors, serotonin reuptake inhibition, norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, and possible COX inhibition.  This results in more effective pain relief compared to either drug alone.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Both drugs are readily absorbed orally. Food may slightly delay absorption.
    - **Metabolism:**
        - Tramadol is metabolized in the liver by CYP2D6 to its active metabolite, O-desmethyltramadol (M1), which has a greater affinity for mu-opioid receptors.  Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6 can influence efficacy and safety.
        - Paracetamol is mainly metabolized in the liver by glucuronidation and sulfation, with a small amount undergoing CYP-mediated oxidation to a reactive metabolite that is detoxified by glutathione.
    - **Elimination:** Both drugs are primarily eliminated by the kidneys.  Elimination may be prolonged in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
- **Mode of Action:**
    - Tramadol binds to mu-opioid receptors, inhibiting pain signaling in the brain and spinal cord. It also inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, contributing to its analgesic effect.
    - Paracetamol is believed to inhibit central COX enzymes, although the exact mechanism isn't fully elucidated.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Tramadol acts as a mu-opioid receptor agonist and inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Paracetamol's potential primary mechanism is central COX inhibition.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for both drugs. Tramadol undergoes hepatic metabolism prior to excretion. Paracetamol undergoes hepatic metabolism through glucuronidation, sulfation, and a minor pathway involving CYP enzymes, primarily CYP2E1, followed by renal excretion.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  The recommended starting dose is two tablets of Paracetamol 325mg/Tramadol 37.5mg or one tablet of Paracetamol 650mg/Tramadol 75mg every 4-6 hours as needed for pain relief.  The maximum daily dose is eight tablets of the 325mg/37.5mg combination or four tablets of the 650mg/75mg combination (equivalent to 300 mg tramadol and 2600 mg paracetamol). The dosing interval should not be less than 6 hours.

#### **Children:** The use of Paracetamol + Tramadol is not recommended for children under 12 years of age. For adolescents 12-18 years old, carefully assess the risks and benefits, and monitor closely for adverse effects, particularly respiratory depression. 

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients (over 75 years):** Dosage interval may need to be extended due to potentially prolonged elimination.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustment may be necessary. For creatinine clearance <30 mL/min, the dosing interval should be increased. For severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min), use is not recommended.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution and consider dosage adjustments, especially in moderate to severe hepatic impairment.  Avoid in severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration is needed for patients with respiratory disease, history of seizures, head injury, increased intracranial pressure, history of substance abuse, and other conditions that may increase the risk of adverse effects.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing in specific clinical settings should follow standard dosing guidelines and be adjusted based on patient response and needs. There are no specific dosage recommendations available for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations other than to individualize the dose based on pain severity and patient factors.  Consult local guidelines and specialist advice as necessary.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on individual patient characteristics including age, renal function, hepatic function, and the presence of comorbid conditions.  Genetic polymorphisms affecting CYP2D6 activity can influence tramadol metabolism and may necessitate dose adjustments.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, constipation, dizziness, somnolence, headache, sweating, pruritus.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:** Respiratory depression, serotonin syndrome, seizures, allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, adrenal insufficiency, hepatotoxicity (especially with paracetamol overdose), dependence and withdrawal symptoms with prolonged use.


### **Long-Term Effects:**  Tolerance, dependence, opioid withdrawal syndrome (upon discontinuation), chronic constipation.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Severe allergic reactions, respiratory depression, serotonin syndrome, hepatotoxicity, seizures.



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to tramadol, paracetamol, or any component of the formulation
- Acute intoxication with alcohol, hypnotics, opioids, or psychotropic drugs
- Severe respiratory depression
- Acute or severe asthma in an unmonitored setting
- Gastrointestinal obstruction
- Uncontrolled epilepsy
- Concomitant use of MAOIs or within 2 weeks of discontinuation
- Severe hepatic impairment
- Patients with known or suspected CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizer status due to increased risk of respiratory depression

## **Drug Interactions**

- **CNS Depressants:** Alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics – Increased risk of respiratory depression and sedation
- **Serotonergic Drugs:** SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs – Increased risk of serotonin syndrome
- **CYP2D6 Inhibitors/Inducers:**  Fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampicin, carbamazepine – Altered tramadol metabolism and potential for increased or decreased efficacy or toxicity.
- **CYP3A4 Inhibitors/Inducers:** Erythromycin, ketoconazole, ritonavir, carbamazepine, rifampicin – May affect tramadol metabolism
- **Warfarin:** Increased risk of bleeding
- **Other Opioid Analgesics:** Increased risk of respiratory depression and other opioid-related adverse effects.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Tramadol is generally not recommended during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester due to limited safety data and potential fetal risks.  Paracetamol is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy. 
- **Fetal Risks:** Potential for neonatal withdrawal syndrome, respiratory depression in the neonate, fetal death, and stillbirths with prolonged tramadol use during pregnancy.
- **Breastfeeding:** Tramadol and paracetamol are excreted in breast milk.  Monitor infants for increased sleepiness, difficulty breastfeeding, and respiratory problems. If possible, use shorter courses and consider alternative analgesics if necessary.




## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Dual-action analgesic; tramadol: mu-opioid receptor agonist, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; paracetamol: potential central COX inhibitor.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, constipation, dizziness, somnolence, headache, respiratory depression, serotonin syndrome, seizures, allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe respiratory depression, acute intoxication with alcohol or drugs, severe hepatic impairment, uncontrolled epilepsy, concomitant use of MAOIs.
