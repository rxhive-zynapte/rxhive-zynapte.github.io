## **Usage**

- Phenobarbitone + Phenytoin is prescribed primarily for the management of various types of epileptic seizures, including generalized tonic-clonic seizures, complex partial seizures, and status epilepticus.  It's also utilized to prevent or control seizures following neurosurgery.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Anticonvulsant.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination exerts its anticonvulsant effect through distinct but complementary mechanisms. Phenobarbitone enhances the inhibitory effect of GABA, a neurotransmitter, while Phenytoin stabilizes neuronal membranes by modulating sodium channels, ultimately reducing the hyperexcitability in the brain that leads to seizures.

## **Alternate Names**

- This combination doesn't have a universally recognized alternate name. It's often referred to by the individual generic names of its components.
- **Brand Names:**  Various brand names exist depending on the manufacturer and geographical region.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Phenobarbitone enhances GABA-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission, suppressing neuronal excitability. Phenytoin blocks voltage-gated sodium channels, preventing repetitive neuronal firing and spread of seizure activity.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Both drugs are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, although Phenytoin's absorption can be erratic.  They undergo hepatic metabolism, primarily by CYP450 enzymes, and are excreted renally.  Phenytoin exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics, meaning small dose changes can lead to disproportionate changes in serum levels. Phenobarbitone induces hepatic enzymes, affecting its own metabolism and that of other drugs.
- **Mode of Action:** Phenobarbitone increases the duration of chloride channel opening, leading to hyperpolarization and decreased neuronal excitability. Phenytoin prolongs the inactivation state of voltage-gated sodium channels, inhibiting the generation and propagation of action potentials.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Phenobarbitone allosterically modulates GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Phenytoin blocks voltage-gated sodium channels.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Both are primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine, although some biliary excretion occurs.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Phenobarbitone:  30-120 mg/day, divided into 2-3 doses.
- Phenytoin:  300-400 mg/day, divided into 2-3 doses, or once daily for extended-release formulations.  Individualized dosing is essential based on serum levels and clinical response.


#### **Children:**

- Phenobarbitone:  3-6 mg/kg/day, divided into 2 doses.
- Phenytoin:  4-8 mg/kg/day, divided into 2-3 doses, adjusted based on serum levels and clinical response.
- **Pediatric Safety Considerations:** Monitor closely for adverse effects, especially in neonates and infants.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and titrate cautiously due to age-related changes in drug clearance.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be necessary for both drugs based on the degree of impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment is required for both Phenobarbitone and Phenytoin,  with careful monitoring of serum levels.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is warranted in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory or liver disease, as these conditions may alter drug metabolism or increase the risk of adverse effects.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations:** Dosing is typically individualized based on the patient's condition and serum levels. IV administration of Phenytoin or Fosphenytoin (phenytoin prodrug) may be preferred in these settings. Status epilepticus is often treated with IV Phenytoin or Fosphenytoin loading dose followed by maintenance dosing.


### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- Dose adjustments are based on serum drug levels, clinical response, and the presence of renal/hepatic dysfunction, other medical conditions, and concomitant medications.  Therapeutic drug monitoring is crucial for Phenytoin, due to its non-linear pharmacokinetics.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Drowsiness, dizziness, ataxia, nystagmus, nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, rash, gingival hyperplasia (Phenytoin).


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hepatotoxicity, blood dyscrasias, megaloblastic anemia, lupus-like syndrome.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Osteomalacia, osteoporosis (Phenytoin), cognitive impairment, behavioral changes.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Severe skin reactions, hepatotoxicity, blood dyscrasias require immediate discontinuation of the drug and supportive care.



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to either drug, porphyria, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Phenobarbitone and Phenytoin interact with numerous medications, including other anticonvulsants, anticoagulants, antifungals, oral contraceptives, and many others. The interactions can be complex, involving enzyme induction or inhibition, altering drug metabolism and serum levels.  Consult a comprehensive drug interaction resource before prescribing this combination. Alcohol, St. John's wort and grapefruit juice can also interact with this combination.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Both drugs are considered to have risks during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, with increased risk of congenital malformations and developmental issues.  
- **Fetal Risks:**  Neural tube defects, orofacial clefts, cardiac defects, and developmental delays.
- **Drug excretion in breast milk:** Both are excreted into breast milk. Monitor the infant for drowsiness, poor feeding, and adequate weight gain.
- Safer alternative anticonvulsants might be considered during pregnancy and breastfeeding, if feasible.
