## **Usage**

Phenylephrine + Triprolidine is prescribed for the temporary relief of symptoms associated with the common cold, hay fever (allergic rhinitis), and other upper respiratory allergies. These symptoms include:

*   Nasal congestion (stuffy nose)
*   Runny nose
*   Sneezing
*   Itching of the nose or throat
*   Itchy, watery eyes

**Pharmacological Classification:**

This combination medication includes two classes of drugs:

*   **Phenylephrine:** Decongestant (alpha-adrenergic agonist)
*   **Triprolidine:** Antihistamine (H1 receptor antagonist)

**Mechanism of Action:**

*   **Phenylephrine:** Constricts blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion.
*   **Triprolidine:** Blocks the action of histamine, a chemical mediator responsible for allergic symptoms.

## **Alternate Names**

While the generic name is Phenylephrine + Triprolidine, it is marketed under various brand names like Prohist LQ.  There may be other regional or international brand names.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

*   **Phenylephrine:** Stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors in the nasal mucosa, causing vasoconstriction and reducing nasal congestion.  It may also slightly increase blood pressure.
*   **Triprolidine:** Competitively antagonizes H1 histamine receptors, relieving symptoms like sneezing, itching, and runny nose. It also has mild sedative properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Both drugs are well-absorbed orally.
*   **Metabolism:** Primarily hepatic metabolism for both drugs.
*   **Elimination:** Excreted mainly through the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:**  As described above, phenylephrine acts on alpha-adrenergic receptors causing vasoconstriction, while triprolidine acts on H1 histamine receptors blocking histamine's effects.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Phenylephrine binds to alpha-adrenergic receptors, while triprolidine competitively binds to H1 histamine receptors. There is no significant enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation directly associated with these two drugs.

**Elimination Pathways:** Hepatic metabolism and renal excretion are the primary elimination pathways. Specific CYP enzyme involvement may vary.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Typically, 5 mL of oral liquid every 4-6 hours, not exceeding 4 doses in 24 hours. Dosages may vary based on the specific product.

#### **Children:**

*   2-6 years: Use with caution as advised by the physician. Dosages must be adjusted based on weight or age, and usually a lower volume is administered.
*   6-11 years: 2.5 mL orally every 6 hours, not exceeding 4 doses daily.
*   12 years and older: Adult dose (5 mL orally every 4-6 hours, not exceeding 4 doses in 24 hours).


#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose due to potential increased sensitivity. Monitor for adverse effects like dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, constipation, rapid heartbeat, difficulty urinating, and blood pressure changes.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with glaucoma, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, prostatic hypertrophy, asthma, or other respiratory diseases. Dosage adjustments may be needed.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of phenylephrine and triprolidine is not typically used in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.  Its primary use is for symptomatic relief of common cold and allergy symptoms.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments should be made based on individual patient characteristics, including renal or hepatic dysfunction, other medical conditions, and concomitant medications.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

*   Drowsiness

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

*   Allergic reactions (hives, difficulty breathing, swelling)
*   Rapid or irregular heartbeat
*   Seizures
*   Hallucinations
*   Difficulty urinating
*   Severe skin reactions

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term continuous use is generally not recommended due to potential tolerance and adverse effects.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Any severe or persistent side effects should be considered as potential ADRs and necessitate immediate medical attention.
