## **Usage**

Phenylephrine + Tropicamide is prescribed to induce mydriasis (pupil dilation) and cycloplegia (paralysis of accommodation) for ophthalmic examinations and procedures. This allows for better visualization of the internal eye structures.  It is also used in some pre- and postoperative states and as an adjunct in treating anterior uveitis. It may also be used to temporarily lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma.

Its pharmacological classifications include:

* **Mydriatic:**  Dilates the pupil.
* **Cycloplegic:** Paralyzes the ciliary muscle, inhibiting accommodation.
* **Sympathomimetic (Phenylephrine):** Mimics the effects of the sympathetic nervous system.
* **Anticholinergic/Antimuscarinic (Tropicamide):** Blocks the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is often referred to as Tropicamide/Phenylephrine ophthalmic.

**Brand Names:** Mydcombi, Phenyltrope, Tropigen Plus, Mydrephrine-P

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Phenylephrine:** Stimulates alpha-1 adrenergic receptors in the iris dilator muscle, causing pupillary dilation. It also constricts conjunctival arterioles.
* **Tropicamide:** Blocks muscarinic receptors in the iris sphincter muscle and ciliary muscle, causing pupillary dilation and paralysis of accommodation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Topically applied, with limited systemic absorption. Systemic absorption can be minimized by applying pressure to the lacrimal sac for 60 seconds after instillation.
* **Metabolism:**  Limited information is available on the metabolism of the ophthalmic formulation.
* **Elimination:** Primarily through renal excretion (Phenylephrine), though the elimination pathway of Tropicamide in ophthalmic form is not well established.


**Mode of Action:**

* **Phenylephrine:**  Acts as an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist, leading to contraction of the iris dilator muscle.
* **Tropicamide:** Acts as a competitive antagonist at muscarinic receptors, preventing acetylcholine from binding and causing contraction of the sphincter pupillae and ciliary muscle.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**

* **Phenylephrine:** Binds to alpha-1 adrenergic receptors.
* **Tropicamide:** Blocks muscarinic cholinergic receptors.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
One to two drops instilled into the affected eye(s). May repeat after 5 minutes if needed. For prolonged effect, an additional drop may be instilled after 20-30 minutes.

#### **Children:**
One drop instilled into each eye to be dilated; repeat after 5 minutes if necessary.  Not to exceed 3 sprays/eye per day. Use with caution in children as CNS and cardiovascular side effects are possible. Not recommended for children under 1 year of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution, monitoring for cardiovascular effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is generally recommended.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment is generally recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with glaucoma, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, hyperthyroidism.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage is generally the same across clinical settings involving ophthalmic examinations:

* **Intubation:**  Not applicable (used for ophthalmic procedures).
* **Surgical Procedures (Ophthalmic):** As directed by the surgeon, usually preoperatively.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not applicable.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  Not applicable.
* **Emergency Situations:** Not applicable.



## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects:**
Transient stinging, blurred vision, increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), eye pain, eye irritation, burning or stinging sensation in the eye, dry mouth, increased intraocular pressure.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, swelling), angle-closure glaucoma (sudden rise in eye pressure), cardiovascular effects (arrhythmias, hypertension, coronary artery spasm), CNS effects (hallucinations, mood changes, unusual behavior, especially in children).

### **Long-Term Effects:**
With appropriate use for diagnostic purposes, long-term effects are unlikely. Prolonged administration can lead to local irritation, hyperemia, edema, and conjunctivitis.


## **Contraindications**
Hypersensitivity to tropicamide, phenylephrine, or any component of the formulation. Narrow-angle glaucoma.  Use of 10% Phenylephrine is contraindicated in patients with hypertension, thyrotoxicosis and in children less than 1 year.



## **Drug Interactions**

* **Atropine-like drugs:**  May enhance pressor effects and induce tachycardia.
* **Cholinergic agonists and ophthalmic cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., carbachol, pilocarpine):** Tropicamide may interfere with their antihypertensive action.
* **Potent inhalation anesthetic agents:** Phenylephrine may potentiate cardiovascular depressant effects.
* **MAO inhibitors (e.g., isocarboxazid, linezolid):** May increase effects of phenylephrine.
* **Antihypertensives, antidepressants (e.g., tricyclics), antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine):** Potential for interactions with phenylephrine.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety: Limited data available. Use only if clearly needed and the benefits outweigh the risks.  May cause vasoconstriction which can be detrimental.

Breastfeeding:  Not known if excreted in human milk. Exercise caution if administering to a nursing woman.
