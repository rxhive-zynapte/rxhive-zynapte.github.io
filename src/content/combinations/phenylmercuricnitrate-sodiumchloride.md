## **Usage**

Phenyl Mercuric Nitrate + Sodium Chloride is primarily used for the management of eye injuries, specifically corneal edema.  It's classified as an ophthalmic solution.  Sodium Chloride acts as an osmotic agent, drawing out excess fluid from the cornea. Phenylmercuric Nitrate acts as an antiseptic and preservative.

## **Alternate Names**

- Phenylmercuric nitrate + Sodium chloride ophthalmic solution
- Hypersol
- Hysol
- Hyperton


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Sodium Chloride creates an osmotic gradient, drawing water out of the swollen cornea to reduce edema and promote healing. Phenylmercuric Nitrate disrupts the cell membranes of microorganisms, thus acting as an antiseptic and preservative.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Absorption is minimal with topical ophthalmic application. Metabolism and elimination pathways for topical application are not well-defined.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Instill 1-2 drops in the affected eye(s) every 4-6 hours. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 8 drops per eye.

#### **Children:**

For children above 2 years, dosage should be determined by a physician, generally following adult recommendations.  Use in children under 2 is not recommended unless specifically directed by a doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments are not usually required but consider comorbidities and overall health.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific adjustments are typically needed, but caution and monitoring are advised.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific adjustments are typically needed, but caution and monitoring are advised.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Evaluate on a case-by-case basis.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific clinical situations like Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, and Emergency Situations needs to be determined based on the individual patient's needs and clinical context and prescribed by the physician.
