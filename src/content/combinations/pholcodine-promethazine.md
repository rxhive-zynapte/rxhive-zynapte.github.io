## **Usage**

Pholcodine + Promethazine is prescribed for the relief of dry, non-productive coughs, often associated with the common cold or allergies. It also provides relief from allergy symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, and watery eyes. Additionally, it may be used to manage nausea and vomiting, motion sickness, and as a preoperative sedative.

Its pharmacological classifications include:

* **Antitussive:** Pholcodine suppresses the cough reflex by acting directly on the cough center in the brain.
* **Antihistamine (first-generation):** Promethazine blocks the action of histamine, reducing allergic symptoms. It also has sedative, antiemetic, and anticholinergic properties.


## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate generic names. Brand names vary by region and may include combinations with other drugs. Some examples are "Codo-Q Junior" and "Tixylix."


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Pholcodine acts centrally on the cough center in the medulla to suppress the cough reflex.  Promethazine is an H1 receptor antagonist, blocking the effects of histamine. It also possesses anticholinergic, sedative, and antiemetic properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Both drugs are absorbed orally. Pholcodine is metabolized in the liver and excreted renally. Promethazine is also metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP450 enzymes, with both renal and biliary excretion.

**Mode of Action:**  Pholcodine is an opioid agonist that binds to opioid receptors in the cough center, decreasing its sensitivity and suppressing the cough reflex.  Promethazine competitively antagonizes H1 receptors, preventing histamine from binding and exerting its effects.

**Elimination Pathways:** Pholcodine is primarily excreted renally. Promethazine undergoes hepatic metabolism followed by both renal and biliary excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The typical adult dose is 5-10 mg of Pholcodine and 6.25-25mg of Promethazine, which can be administered three or four times daily as needed. Alternatively, 10-15 mg of Pholcodine with 25-50mg of Promethazine can be administered every 8-10 hours.

#### **Children:** Use with caution in children. Dosing must be determined by a doctor based on weight and age. The combination is generally contraindicated in children under 6 years old.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Reduced dosage is recommended due to age-related decline in hepatic and renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised. Dosage adjustment may be necessary depending on the severity of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised. Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with respiratory conditions like asthma or COPD, cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, and prostatic hypertrophy.



### **Clinical Use Cases**  Dosages in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations should be guided by individual patient needs and clinical judgment under the supervision of an anesthesiologist or critical care specialist. The sedative and antiemetic properties may be useful, but potential respiratory depression needs careful consideration.


### **Dosage Adjustments** Adjust dosages based on patient response, renal/hepatic function, and other patient-specific factors.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:** Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:** Seizures, tremor, akathisia, respiratory depression (especially in children), severe allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), and extrapyramidal symptoms.

### **Long-Term Effects:**  Chronic complications are rare but potential long-term effects with prolonged use include tardive dyskinesia and dependence on pholcodine.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** Any signs of hypersensitivity, severe respiratory depression, or extrapyramidal reactions.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to either drug.
* Respiratory depression or failure.
* Acute asthma attack.
* Chronic bronchitis, COPD, bronchiolitis, or bronchiectasis.
* Liver disease.
* Concomitant use of MAOIs.
* Children under 6 years of age.


## **Drug Interactions**

* CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, opioids, sedatives): Increased sedation and respiratory depression.
* Anticholinergic drugs (e.g., atropine): Enhanced anticholinergic effects.
* MAO inhibitors:  Hypertensive crisis.
* CYP450 inhibitors/inducers: May alter the metabolism of promethazine.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Safety has not been established, and potential fetal risks exist.  Consult with a specialist to weigh the benefits against potential risks.  If possible, alternative safer options may be considered.
