      and in severe cases, atropine may be used to counteract bradycardia.

## **Usage**

Pilocarpine + Timolol ophthalmic solution is prescribed for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  It combines two different classes of drugs to achieve its therapeutic effect:

- **Pilocarpine:** A miotic agent, belonging to the class of cholinergic agonists, directly stimulates the muscarinic receptors in the eye, causing contraction of the ciliary muscle.  This increases the outflow of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork.

- **Timolol:** A beta-adrenergic blocker that reduces the production of aqueous humor.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination is often referred to as Timolol + Pilocarpine. A common brand name is Timpilo®.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Pilocarpine, a cholinergic agonist, acts directly on muscarinic receptors in the eye, leading to miosis (pupillary constriction), increased trabecular outflow of aqueous humor, and a subsequent decrease in IOP. Timolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, inhibits beta-adrenergic receptors, reducing aqueous humor production and thereby lowering IOP.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Both drugs are absorbed systemically following topical ophthalmic administration.  Timolol reaches peak plasma concentrations within 1 to 2 hours and is metabolized in the liver. It is excreted primarily through the kidneys.  Pilocarpine's systemic absorption is generally low after topical application, with a rapid onset of action (10-30 minutes). Pilocarpine is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily by the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** Pilocarpine directly stimulates muscarinic receptors, specifically M3 subtype, on the ciliary muscle and trabecular meshwork cells. This stimulation leads to contraction of the ciliary muscle, widening the spaces within the trabecular meshwork, facilitating the outflow of aqueous humor. Timolol blocks the action of catecholamines, particularly epinephrine, on beta-adrenergic receptors (primarily beta-2) in the ciliary epithelium, reducing the formation of aqueous humor.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One drop of Timpilo® 2 (0.5% Timolol + 2% Pilocarpine) is instilled into the affected eye(s) twice daily. If IOP control is inadequate, the dosage may be increased to one drop of Timpilo® 4 (0.5% Timolol + 4% Pilocarpine) twice daily.


#### **Children:**

The safety and efficacy of Pilocarpine + Timolol have not been established in children.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient responses.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage modifications are usually not required unless significant renal dysfunction is present.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dosage adjustments may be needed in moderate to severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of Pilocarpine and Timolol is specifically indicated for the long-term management of glaucoma and ocular hypertension.  It is not typically used in acute clinical settings like intubation, surgery, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on the patient's IOP response. If the target IOP is not achieved with Timpilo® 2, the concentration of Pilocarpine can be increased to 4%.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**
Blurred vision, eye irritation, stinging, burning, tearing, headache, brow ache, changes in near vision.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, retinal detachment, heart failure.

### **Long-Term Effects**
Cataracts, corneal endothelial damage.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Significant ADRs are rare but can include severe bradycardia, bronchospasm requiring urgent medical attention, and allergic reactions.


## **Contraindications**
Asthma, bronchitis, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sinus bradycardia, second or third-degree atrioventricular block, cardiac failure, hypersensitivity to components.



## **Drug Interactions**
Other beta-blockers (systemic and topical), calcium channel blockers, digitalis glycosides, quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Timolol has been detected in human milk; use with caution in breastfeeding mothers and only if clinically needed. Pilocarpine + Timolol is generally avoided in pregnancy due to the potential risks of beta-blocker exposure to the fetus.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Reduces IOP by increasing aqueous humor outflow (Pilocarpine) and decreasing its production (Timolol).
- **Side Effects:** Blurred vision, eye irritation, stinging, headache, brow ache, bradycardia, bronchospasm.
- **Contraindications:** Asthma, COPD, bradycardia, AV block, cardiac failure.
- **Drug Interactions:** Other beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution; potential for adverse effects in infants.
- **Dosage:** 1 drop Timpilo® 2 twice daily, increased to Timpilo® 4 if needed.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** IOP, heart rate, respiratory function.


## **Popular Combinations**

Pilocarpine + Timolol itself represents a popular fixed-dose combination. Sometimes, it may be combined with other IOP-lowering medications if necessary, but this requires careful monitoring.



## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Monitor IOP regularly, assess cardiovascular and respiratory function.
- **Specific Populations:** Use cautiously in pregnant/breastfeeding women, elderly, and patients with renal/hepatic impairment.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Limit alcohol, avoid driving immediately after application if vision is blurred.
