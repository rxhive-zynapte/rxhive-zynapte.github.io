## **Usage**

- Pioglitazone + Teneligliptin is prescribed for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults, specifically when diet and exercise alone or treatment with either Pioglitazone or Teneligliptin alone does not provide adequate glycemic control.  It may also be used as a second-line treatment for type 2 diabetes when lifestyle modifications and initial single antidiabetic medications haven't achieved sufficient glycemic control.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antidiabetic combination therapy.  Specifically, it combines a thiazolidinedione (Pioglitazone) and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor (Teneligliptin).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Pioglitazone increases insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues (muscle, adipose tissue) by activating PPAR-γ receptors. Teneligliptin inhibits DPP-4 enzyme activity, increasing the levels of incretin hormones (GLP-1 and GIP). This leads to enhanced glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppressed glucagon release.


## **Alternate Names**

-  This combination therapy doesn't have an international nonproprietary name (INN). It is commonly referred to by the names of its constituents, Pioglitazone and Teneligliptin.
- **Brand Names:** Teneligold Pio, other brand names may exist regionally.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Pioglitazone improves insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, reducing insulin resistance.  Teneligliptin enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppresses glucagon release, improving postprandial and fasting glucose levels.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - **Pioglitazone:** Absorbed well orally, extensively metabolized in the liver (primarily by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4), has a half-life of 5-6 hours (parent drug) and 16-23 hours (active metabolites), eliminated primarily through biliary/fecal excretion.
    - **Teneligliptin:** Well absorbed orally, metabolized by FMO3, FMO1, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, has a longer half-life of approximately 24 hours, primarily excreted in urine (about 20% as unchanged drug).
- **Mode of Action:** Pioglitazone activates PPAR-γ, a nuclear receptor that regulates gene expression related to glucose and lipid metabolism. Teneligliptin inhibits DPP-4, preventing the degradation of incretin hormones, thus enhancing their effects on insulin secretion and glucagon suppression.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Pioglitazone binds to and activates PPAR-γ receptors. Teneligliptin inhibits the enzyme DPP-4.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Pioglitazone is primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism and biliary/fecal excretion. Teneligliptin is primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- One tablet containing 20 mg Teneligliptin and either 15 mg or 30 mg of Pioglitazone, taken orally once daily.  This can be taken with or without food.
- Dosage may be adjusted based on individual patient response and tolerability.

#### **Children:**

- This medication is not recommended for children under 18 years of age.  Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustment is typically required unless there is significant renal or hepatic impairment. Close monitoring is advisable.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Teneligliptin's dosage does not require adjustment in patients with renal impairment. Pioglitazone requires caution and potential dosage adjustment in moderate to severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Pioglitazone is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment.  Teneligliptin may require dosage adjustments in severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Exercise caution in patients with heart failure, bladder cancer history, and other conditions. Individualized assessment and dosage adjustments may be needed. 

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Not typically used in these acute care settings. Standard diabetes management applies in such cases.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dosage modifications may be required based on renal or hepatic function, concomitant medications, and individual patient response.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Pioglitazone increases insulin sensitivity, Teneligliptin increases incretin hormone levels.

## **Precautions**

- Monitor liver function tests, renal function (especially for Pioglitazone), blood glucose levels regularly.
- Avoid alcohol (may increase risk of hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis with Metformin if used concomitantly).
