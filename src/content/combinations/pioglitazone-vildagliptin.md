## **Usage**

- Pioglitazone + Vildagliptin is prescribed for the management of **type 2 diabetes mellitus** in adults when diet and exercise alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications do not provide adequate glycemic control.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antidiabetic combination therapy, including a thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone) and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor (vildagliptin).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Pioglitazone increases insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues (muscle, liver, and fat) and reduces hepatic glucose production. Vildagliptin inhibits DPP-4, leading to increased levels of incretin hormones (GLP-1 and GIP), which stimulate insulin release and suppress glucagon secretion.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for the combination itself. Individual components have generic names (pioglitazone hydrochloride and vildagliptin).
- **Brand Names:**  This combination is available under various brand names globally (e.g., Zomelis Met).



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Pioglitazone: Binds to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) in muscle, fat, and liver cells, promoting glucose uptake and reducing hepatic glucose output. Vildagliptin: Inhibits DPP-4 enzyme, preventing the degradation of incretin hormones like GLP-1 and GIP, which then enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion and decrease glucagon levels.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Pioglitazone: Orally administered, extensively metabolized by the liver (CYP2C8 and CYP3A4), primarily eliminated through the feces and also in small amounts in urine. Vildagliptin: Orally administered, rapidly absorbed, excreted primarily unchanged in the urine (85%) and a small amount in feces, minimal hepatic metabolism.
- **Mode of Action:** The combination works synergistically through two distinct mechanisms to improve glycemic control. Pioglitazone enhances insulin action at the cellular level, while vildagliptin augments the incretin effect, promoting insulin release and reducing glucagon secretion.
- **Receptor Binding:** Pioglitazone binds to PPARγ nuclear receptors.
- **Enzyme Inhibition:** Vildagliptin inhibits DPP-4.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Pioglitazone predominantly by hepatic metabolism (CYP2C8 and CYP3A4), followed by fecal and minor urinary excretion. Vildagliptin primarily through renal excretion with minimal hepatic metabolism.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- Usual starting dose is 50 mg vildagliptin + 15 mg pioglitazone once daily, taken orally in the morning.
- The dose may be increased to 50 mg vildagliptin + 30 mg pioglitazone once daily based on individual patient response and glycemic control.  
- Maximum dose: 50 mg vildagliptin + 45 mg pioglitazone.

#### **Children:**
- Not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate therapy at lower doses and monitor closely for adverse effects, especially edema and heart failure.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Vildagliptin dosage adjustment required for moderate to severe renal dysfunction. No dosage adjustment necessary for pioglitazone in mild to moderate renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Pioglitazone should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Vildagliptin is contraindicated in moderate to severe hepatic dysfunction.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in heart failure patients, especially those with NYHA Class III or IV heart failure.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

-  Not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its primary role is in chronic management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjust dosages based on renal function, hepatic function, patient response, and concurrent medications. Titrate cautiously and monitor for adverse effects.
