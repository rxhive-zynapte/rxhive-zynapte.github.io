# Piperacillin + Tazobactam

## **Usage**

Piperacillin + Tazobactam is prescribed for a variety of bacterial infections, including:

* Intra-abdominal infections (e.g., appendicitis, peritonitis, biliary infections)
* Skin and soft tissue infections (including diabetic foot infections)
* Respiratory tract infections (e.g., nosocomial pneumonia)
* Urinary tract infections (including pyelonephritis)
* Sepsis
* Febrile neutropenia
* Gynecological infections (e.g., pelvic inflammatory disease)
* Bone and joint infections
* Polymicrobial infections


**Pharmacological Classification:**  Antibiotic; specifically, a beta-lactam antibiotic combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor.

**Mechanism of Action:** Piperacillin, a broad-spectrum penicillin, inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Tazobactam, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, protects piperacillin from degradation by bacterial beta-lactamases, thus extending its spectrum of activity.


## **Alternate Names**

Piperacillin/Tazobactam

**Brand Names:** Tazocin®, Zosyn®, PipTaz®


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Piperacillin + Tazobactam exerts its bactericidal effect by disrupting bacterial cell wall synthesis, ultimately leading to cell lysis and death.  Tazobactam enhances piperacillin's effectiveness by inhibiting a wide range of beta-lactamases produced by bacteria, which would otherwise inactivate piperacillin.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Administered intravenously, achieving rapid and complete bioavailability.
* **Distribution:** Distributes widely into various tissues and body fluids, including the pleural, peritoneal, and cerebrospinal fluids.
* **Metabolism:** Piperacillin undergoes minimal metabolism. Tazobactam is partially metabolized to an inactive metabolite.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated via renal excretion, with both piperacillin and tazobactam exhibiting a similar half-life.

**Mode of Action:** Piperacillin binds to PBPs, enzymes essential for bacterial cell wall synthesis.  This binding disrupts the cross-linking of peptidoglycans, a crucial component of the cell wall, resulting in cell wall instability and eventual bacterial death. Tazobactam forms stable complexes with beta-lactamases, preventing them from hydrolyzing the beta-lactam ring of piperacillin.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Piperacillin acts by inhibiting PBPs. Tazobactam inhibits beta-lactamases.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Standard dose:** 3.375 g every 6 hours or 4.5 g every 8 hours, administered intravenously over 30 minutes.
* **Maximum daily dose:** Up to 18 g piperacillin/2.25 g tazobactam.

#### **Children (2-12 years):**

* **Intra-abdominal infections:** 100 mg piperacillin/12.5 mg tazobactam per kg every 8 hours IV.
* **Febrile neutropenia:** 80 mg piperacillin/10 mg tazobactam per kg every 6 hours IV (often combined with an aminoglycoside).
* **Children >40 kg:** Use adult dosing.
* **Children < 2 years:** Safety and efficacy not established.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment may be necessary in the presence of renal impairment.  
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment is necessary based on creatinine clearance (CrCl). 
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No dose adjustment is typically needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient factors.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage and frequency should be tailored to the specific infection and patient condition. In severe infections, higher doses (up to 18 g piperacillin/2.25 g tazobactam per day) and more frequent administration (every 6 hours) may be necessary.  Combination therapy with an aminoglycoside is often recommended for serious infections caused by *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, especially in neutropenic patients.  Dosage adjustments should be made in patients with renal impairment based on their creatinine clearance.

* **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use/Emergency Situations:**  Dosage should be adjusted according to the severity of the infection and patient factors.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

See above under "Special Cases".

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Crosses the placenta. Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:** Piperacillin is excreted in low concentrations in breast milk. Tazobactam concentrations in human milk are unknown. Caution is advised.
