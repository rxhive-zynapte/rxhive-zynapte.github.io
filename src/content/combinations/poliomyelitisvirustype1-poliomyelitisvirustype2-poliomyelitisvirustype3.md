## **Usage**

This combination of  Poliomyelitis Virus Type 1, 2, and 3 is used for active immunization against poliomyelitis. It is prescribed to prevent poliomyelitis, not to treat it.  This combination vaccine is categorized as an active viral vaccine. The vaccine works by inducing an immune response in the body, creating antibodies specifically targeted against all three types of the poliovirus. This provides immunity and protects against contracting poliomyelitis upon subsequent exposure to the virus.

## **Alternate Names**

Trivalent Oral Poliovirus Vaccine (tOPV),  Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV).
Some popular brands are Sabin and other brand names as per availability in different countries.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV) contains live attenuated (weakened) strains of all three poliovirus serotypes. Upon administration, the viruses replicate in the intestinal tract, stimulating both humoral and intestinal mucosal immunity. This leads to the production of specific antibodies (IgG, IgA) against each poliovirus type. The immune response generated mimics that of a natural infection, but without causing the disease itself.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The oral route of administration ensures localized replication within the gastrointestinal tract. The viruses are not intended to be systemically absorbed. However, the immune response it elicits triggers the production of antibodies, which then circulate in the blood, providing systemic protection. The viruses in the vaccine are eventually eliminated through the digestive system.

**Mechanism of Action:**  tOPV stimulates the production of neutralizing antibodies that bind to the poliovirus, preventing its entry into cells and thus stopping infection. It also produces localized gut immunity thanks to the production of IgA.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Not routinely administered to adults except in special circumstances (like outbreaks) where an initial dose and subsequent boosters may be given as per national guidelines.

#### **Children:** The standard pediatric dosage schedule typically involves multiple doses, with the first dose given at around 6 weeks, followed by additional doses at intervals defined in the country specific immunization program.

#### **Special Cases:** Dose adjustments are not typically required in special patient populations like elderly, renally or hepatically impaired individuals, as tOPV administration is not routine in these groups.

### **Clinical Use Cases**
tOPV is not used in clinical settings like intubation, surgery, ICU, or emergencies. It is solely for routine childhood immunization or for specific outbreak management.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**  Generally, tOPV is well-tolerated.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:** Vaccine-Associated Paralytic Poliomyelitis (VAPP) is an extremely rare but serious adverse event.


## **Contraindications**

Immunocompromised individuals (due to the live attenuated viruses).


## **Drug Interactions**
No clinically significant interactions are commonly reported.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
Generally, tOPV is not recommended during pregnancy.  Regarding breastfeeding, its use is generally avoided in the national immunization program.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Induces immunity against all three types of poliovirus by stimulating antibody production.
- **Side Effects:** Generally well-tolerated, VAPP (extremely rare).
- **Contraindications:** Immunocompromised individuals.
- **Drug Interactions:** Not significant.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Not recommended.
- **Dosage:** As per the established national/international immunization schedule.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Not typically applicable for vaccines.


## **Popular Combinations**

Often administered as part of combined childhood vaccines.

## **Precautions**

Standard vaccination precautions apply.
