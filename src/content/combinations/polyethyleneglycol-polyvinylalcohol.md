## **Usage**

Polyethylene Glycol + Polyvinyl Alcohol is prescribed for the relief of dry, irritated eyes.  It is classified as an ophthalmic lubricant or artificial tear. This combination works by lubricating the ocular surface, providing a protective coating that helps retain moisture and reduce friction.

## **Alternate Names**

This drug combination may be referred to as artificial tears or ocular lubricant. Several brand names exist, often containing varying formulations with additional ingredients. It is important to consult the product packaging for the specific composition.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Polyethylene Glycol and Polyvinyl Alcohol act topically on the ocular surface. They increase the viscosity of the tear film, providing lubrication and reducing evaporation. They also provide a soothing effect on irritated ocular tissues.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Due to their high molecular weight and the nature of topical application, these polymers are not systemically absorbed. The minimal amount that may be absorbed is not clinically significant. Elimination pathways are not applicable due to the lack of systemic absorption. There is no receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation involved in their mechanism of action.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Instill 1 or 2 drops into the affected eye(s) as needed.

#### **Children:**  Use as directed by a physician. Pediatric safety considerations are generally not applicable due to minimal systemic absorption. However, always consult with a pediatrician before use in children.

#### **Special Cases:**  Dosage adjustments are generally not necessary in elderly patients, or those with renal or hepatic impairment due to lack of systemic absorption. However, individual patient needs should be considered.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in clinical settings, such as during intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations, follows the standard dosage recommendations as needed for ocular lubrication.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Specific dosage adjustments are generally not necessary due to the topical nature of the medication and minimal systemic absorption.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Temporary blurred vision immediately after application
- Minor burning, stinging, or irritation

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Eye pain
- Changes in vision
- Continued eye redness/irritation
- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, dizziness, trouble breathing)

### **Long-Term Effects**

No long-term adverse effects have been reported with this combination.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs are rare.  Allergic reactions require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

- Known hypersensitivity to polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, or any other components of the formulation.

## **Drug Interactions**

Clinically significant drug interactions are not expected with this ophthalmic lubricant. However, it's advisable to inform your physician about all other medications being used, including other eye drops.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been extensively studied. Use with caution and only if clearly needed. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, consult your doctor before use.
