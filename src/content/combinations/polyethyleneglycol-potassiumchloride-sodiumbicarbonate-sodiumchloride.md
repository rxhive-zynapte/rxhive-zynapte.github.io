      medications within 1 hour before, during, and shortly after the bowel
      prep.  Consult your doctor about the timing of other essential
      medications.

## **Usage**

- This combination medication is primarily prescribed for bowel cleansing before colonoscopies or other intestinal procedures. It's classified as an osmotic laxative.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Osmotic laxative and electrolyte supplement.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 is a large molecule that isn't absorbed by the gut. It stays within the colon, drawing water into the intestines through osmosis. This increase in water softens the stool and induces bowel movements.  The electrolytes (potassium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, and sodium chloride) in the formulation maintain proper fluid and electrolyte balance during the bowel cleansing process.


## **Alternate Names**

- PEG-3350 + Electrolytes
- PEG-3350, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Bicarbonate, and Potassium Chloride for Oral Solution
- **Brand Names:**  NuLytely, GoLYTELY, CoLyte, GaviLyte, MoviPrep, HalfLytely (with Bisacodyl)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  The primary effect is an increase in water content within the colon leading to bowel cleansing. The electrolytes help maintain physiological electrolyte levels, counteracting losses through diarrhea.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** PEG 3350 is minimally absorbed systemically and is eliminated primarily in the feces. The electrolytes are absorbed as needed to maintain balance and excess is eliminated renally.
- **Mode of Action:** Osmosis.  PEG 3350 increases intraluminal osmotic pressure, drawing water into the colon. This increased volume stimulates peristalsis.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** None reported.
- **Elimination pathways:** PEG 3350 – fecal excretion; Electrolytes – primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Typically, patients drink a total of 4 liters of the reconstituted solution. The recommended rate is 240 mL (8 oz) every 10 minutes until the full volume is consumed or the rectal effluent is clear.  Alternatively, two 2-liter split doses may be administered:  one the evening before the colonoscopy and another the following morning, at least two hours before the procedure.

#### **Children (6 months and older):**

- 25 mL/kg/hour, either orally or by nasogastric tube (NGT), until rectal effluent is clear, not to exceed a total of 4 liters.  NGT administration is at 25 mL/kg/hour. NGT administration through bolus method is 20-30 mL per minute.



#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Close monitoring of hydration and electrolyte status is essential due to potential age-related decreases in renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution is advised, and monitoring of electrolytes is crucial. Dose adjustment might be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Careful monitoring is recommended, although significant dose adjustment is typically not necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Close attention to fluid and electrolyte balance is especially important in patients with conditions like congestive heart failure, renal disease, or those taking medications that affect electrolyte levels.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

This solution is not systemically absorbed and is utilized only for bowel cleansing, hence, its use is restricted to preparations prior to:

- **Colonoscopy:** Standard bowel preparation as detailed above.
- **Barium Enema X-ray Examination:**  Similar to colonoscopy prep.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments may be needed based on patient tolerance and the degree of bowel cleansing achieved. Patients who experience severe discomfort during administration may slow the rate of consumption or take short breaks.  In case of dehydration, consider reducing the intake and consider increasing the intake of fluids.



## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects:**

- Nausea
- Abdominal fullness/bloating
- Abdominal cramps
- Vomiting
- Anal irritation



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Severe dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities (can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and renal impairment)
- Ischemic colitis


### **Long-Term Effects:**

No significant long-term adverse effects are associated with the single-dose use typically employed for bowel cleansing.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Allergic reactions (rare, ranging from mild skin reactions to anaphylaxis)


## **Contraindications**

- Gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation
- Gastric retention or ileus
- Toxic colitis or toxic megacolon
- Known hypersensitivity to any components of the solution

## **Drug Interactions**

- Oral medications taken within one hour before or during administration of the bowel preparation may not be fully absorbed due to rapid gut transit. It is not recommended to combine PEG 3350 + electrolytes with other laxative products to avoid increased risk of side effects.
- Medications that increase the risk of fluid and electrolyte disturbances (e.g., diuretics, some antihypertensives) should be used with caution.
- May interact with anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine), potentially decreasing their effectiveness.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Consult with a doctor. The safety of this medication during pregnancy has not been fully established. Use only if clearly needed.
- **Breastfeeding:**  It's unknown whether this drug passes into breast milk. Consult with a doctor before using while breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Osmotic laxative and electrolyte supplement.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, bloating, cramping, vomiting, anal irritation. Rarely: severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** GI obstruction, perforation, gastric retention, toxic colitis, megacolon, hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:**  May interfere with absorption of other oral medications.  Caution with diuretics, antihypertensives, and anticonvulsants.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult with a doctor before use.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 4 liters (240 mL every 10 minutes). Children (≥6 months): 25 mL/kg/hour.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Electrolytes, hydration status.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Some preparations combine PEG 3350 + electrolytes with a stimulant laxative like bisacodyl (e.g., HalfLytely and Bisacodyl Tablets Bowel Prep Kit) for enhanced bowel cleansing. This is commonly used in split-dosing regimens.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Adequate hydration is essential before, during, and after the bowel preparation. Monitor patients with significant cardiovascular, renal, or gastrointestinal disease.
- **Pregnant Women:** Use only if clearly needed, under careful medical supervision.
- **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Consult with a doctor before use.
- **Children & Elderly:** Close monitoring of hydration and electrolyte status is especially important.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** A clear liquid diet is required during the preparation period. Avoid solid foods for at least 2 hours before starting the bowel preparation.
