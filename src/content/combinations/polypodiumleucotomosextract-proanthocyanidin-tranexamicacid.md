## **Usage**

This combination is primarily prescribed as a  supplement for photoprotection, skin health and to reduce melasma or hyperpigmentation.  Tranexamic acid can reduce bleeding in various conditions. It does not represent a single, approved drug but a combination of ingredients with potential synergistic effects.

- **Polypodium leucotomos extract:** Photoprotection, Antioxidant,  Reduction of  UV-induced skin damage, Melasma.
- **Proanthocyanidin:** Antioxidant, capillary strengthening, potential benefits for cardiovascular health.
- **Tranexamic Acid:** Antifibrinolytic,  reduction of bleeding in menorrhagia, epistaxis, and other bleeding disorders.

It's important to note that this combination isn't a recognized pharmacological class in itself but comprises ingredients belonging to different categories like antioxidants, antifibrinolytics, and photoprotectants.

## **Alternate Names**

* **Polypodium leucotomos extract:** Anapsos速,  Fernblock速
* **Proanthocyanidin:** Procyanidin,  Condensed tannins,  Oligomeric proanthocyanidin complexes (OPCs)
* **Tranexamic Acid:**  Cyklokapron速, Lysteda速

## **How It Works**

**Polypodium leucotomos extract:** Exhibits antioxidant and photoprotective properties by scavenging free radicals, reducing UV-induced inflammation and DNA damage. Precise mechanisms are still under investigation.

**Proanthocyanidin:** Acts as potent antioxidants. May also contribute to vascular health by strengthening capillaries.  Precise mechanisms are still being researched.

**Tranexamic Acid:**  Antifibrinolytic agent that inhibits plasminogen activation, thus preventing the breakdown of fibrin clots.  This action reduces bleeding.

Elimination pathways for each component:

- **Polypodium leucotomos extract:** Primarily hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.
- **Proanthocyanidin:** Metabolism and excretion not fully elucidated, possibly involving both renal and hepatic routes.
- **Tranexamic Acid:** Primarily renal excretion with minimal metabolism.
