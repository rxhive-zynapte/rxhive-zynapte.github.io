## **Usage**

This combination medication is primarily used in the treatment of hyperpigmentation (melasma), a condition characterized by darkened patches of skin due to increased melanin production. It is also used to manage heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia).

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Proanthocyanidin is classified as a phytochemical, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory agent. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent.

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Proanthocyanidin inhibits tyrosinase, an enzyme crucial for melanin synthesis, and suppresses melanocyte activity, thereby reducing melanin production. Tranexamic acid prevents the breakdown of blood clots, which reduces bleeding. This combination also promotes collagen synthesis and improves skin quality.


## **Alternate Names**

Several brand names exist for this combination, including Oxifine-TX, Qtvit-TX, Melano-TX, Triolite, Nucell-TX, Praxamic, Gse+tx, and Tyrodin Plus.  It's sometimes referred to as Pine Bark Extract + Tranexamic Acid.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Proanthocyanidin exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, protecting blood vessels and promoting collagen and elastin production in the skin.  Tranexamic acid, by inhibiting plasminogen activation and subsequent fibrinolysis, stabilizes blood clots and reduces bleeding.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** The pharmacokinetic profile of the combined formulation isn't well-defined.  Tranexamic acid is readily absorbed orally, with peak plasma levels reached in approximately 3 hours.  It is primarily excreted renally. Proanthocyanidin absorption and metabolism data are limited, although it is believed to be well-absorbed after oral administration.

- **Mode of Action:** Proanthocyanidin targets melanocytes by inhibiting tyrosinase, thus reducing melanin synthesis.  Tranexamic acid binds to plasminogen, preventing its conversion to plasmin, the enzyme responsible for dissolving fibrin clots.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Tranexamic acid is predominantly eliminated unchanged through renal excretion.  Information on proanthocyanidin elimination is limited.


## **Dosage**

Dosage information for the combination product is limited.  Dosing for tranexamic acid is better defined and will be supplied.  Proanthocyanidin dosing is less clear but typical dosages are provided. Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized dosing recommendations.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Tranexamic Acid:**
    - For heavy menstrual bleeding: 1000-1500 mg orally three times a day, for up to five days during menstruation. Start taking as soon as bleeding begins.
    - Other bleeding conditions: Consult a physician for appropriate dosing.

- **Proanthocyanidin:**
    - Typical dosage: 75-150 mg twice daily.

#### **Children:**

Use in children is not routinely recommended. Consult a pediatrician if considering use in children. Dosage should be weight based if prescribed, at 25mg/kg per dose at adult frequencies.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dose reduction is necessary for tranexamic acid unless renal impairment is present. For proanthocyanidin, dosage adjustments may be needed based on individual health status.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose reduction of tranexamic acid is recommended in patients with renal impairment.  Consult specific dosing guidelines based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised with tranexamic acid in patients with hepatic impairment, although specific dosage adjustments may not be required.  Limited information is available regarding proanthocyanidin.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, thromboembolic disorders, or a history of seizures.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing recommendations for clinical use cases, other than heavy menstrual bleeding, should be determined by a physician based on the specific condition and patient factors.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be required based on renal function, hepatic function, and other patient-specific factors.  Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized dosage recommendations.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, muscle pain, fatigue, stuffy nose, sinusitis.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Visual disturbances, severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), blood clots (thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism), decreased blood pressure.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic complications from prolonged use are rare but may include vision changes and increased risk of thromboembolic events.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Serious ADRs include visual changes, angioedema, and thromboembolic complications.

## **Drug Interactions**

Tranexamic acid may interact with hormonal contraceptives, clotting factor concentrates, fibrinolytic medications, and some acne medications.  Concurrent use of other drugs that increase the risk of thrombosis should be avoided.  Consult drug interaction resources for detailed information.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not well-established. Caution is advised.  Consult a physician before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
