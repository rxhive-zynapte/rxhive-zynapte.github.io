      on the central nervous system and cardiovascular system.  Renal and
      hepatic function should be assessed as needed. Regular eye checkups may be
      advisable for some patients.

## **Usage**

- Procaine + Sodium Fluoride is prescribed for the treatment of filariasis, a parasitic infection caused by filarial worms.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Antiparasitic agent, local anesthetic.
- **Mechanism of action:** Sodium fluoride acts as an antiparasitic agent, killing the filarial worms. Procaine, a local anesthetic, minimizes injection site discomfort.

## **Alternate Names**

- Florocid Injection

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Sodium fluoride exerts its antiparasitic effect by disrupting the metabolic processes of the filarial worms. Procaine blocks nerve conduction, leading to localized numbness.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** The combination is administered intramuscularly.  Absorption and distribution details for the combination are not readily available. Procaine is metabolized by plasma cholinesterase, and metabolites are primarily excreted renally.  Sodium fluoride is distributed widely throughout the body, stored in bones and teeth, and excreted renally.
- **Mode of action:** Sodium fluoride is an anti-parasitic agent that appears to disrupt energy metabolism in susceptible organisms. Procaine blocks voltage-gated sodium channels, inhibiting nerve impulse transmission. 
- **Elimination pathways:** Procaine is metabolized by plasma cholinesterase and excreted renally. Sodium fluoride is excreted mainly through the kidneys.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 2 ml intramuscularly (IM) once weekly for 4 weeks.  Each dose consists of 1 ampule of sodium fluoride (1% w/v) and 1 ampule of procaine hydrochloride (2% w/v).


#### **Children:**

- Not generally recommended for young children. If necessary, dosage must be carefully determined by a physician based on age, weight, and overall health.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Close monitoring is recommended, and dosage modifications may be necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Renal function should be assessed, and dose adjustment may be needed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustments may be required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with asthma, gastrointestinal blockages, urinary difficulties, enlarged prostate, or heart conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical settings outside of treating Filariasis are not established.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be needed based on the individual patient's renal or hepatic function, comorbid conditions, and other factors.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Pain at the injection site
- Tingling or numbness
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Diarrhea

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (e.g., rash, hives, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
- Severe dizziness or lightheadedness
- Vision changes
- Seizures

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term adverse effects related specifically to the combination are not clearly defined in available literature. With prolonged sodium fluoride exposure at high doses, there is risk of skeletal fluorosis and dental fluorosis.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

ADRs requiring immediate medical attention include severe allergic reactions, seizures, and cardiac effects associated with procaine toxicity (rare with proper dosing).

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to procaine, sodium fluoride, or any component of the formulation
- Asthma
- Gastrointestinal obstruction
- Urinary retention
- Enlarged prostate
- Severe heart conditions


## **Drug Interactions**

- Medications for heart conditions (with procaine)
- Muscle relaxants (e.g., pancuronium, atracurium, succinylcholine)
- Sulfonamide antibiotics (e.g., sulfamethoxazole)
- Alcohol and tobacco may exacerbate side effects.
- Hormonal contraceptives may have reduced efficacy.
- Cyclosporine (concomitant use is contraindicated)



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** B (Animal studies show no risk; human data are limited.) Use only if clearly needed and after careful assessment of risks and benefits.
- **Breastfeeding:** Caution is advised as it is unknown if these drugs are excreted in breast milk.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Sodium fluoride: antiparasitic; Procaine: local anesthetic
