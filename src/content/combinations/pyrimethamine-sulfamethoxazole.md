## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Pyrimethamine + Sulfamethoxazole is prescribed for the treatment and prophylaxis of malaria caused by *Plasmodium falciparum*, particularly in areas with chloroquine-resistant strains. It's also indicated for toxoplasmosis, and as an alternative for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis when other options are not feasible.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antimalarial, Antiparasitic, Antibiotic (Sulfonamide)
- **Mechanism of Action:** Pyrimethamine inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, and sulfamethoxazole inhibits dihydropteroate synthase. These combined actions disrupt the folic acid synthesis pathway in susceptible organisms, leading to impaired DNA synthesis and ultimately, cell death.


## **Alternate Names**

- Fansidar (brand name)
- S-Pyrimac (brand name)
- Swidar (brand name)
- Vitadar (brand name)
- MA163 (brand name)
- G-COSPEÂ® (brand name)



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Pyrimethamine and sulfamethoxazole act synergistically to inhibit folic acid synthesis.  This results in the disruption of DNA synthesis and ultimately cell death in susceptible organisms like *Plasmodium falciparum* and *Toxoplasma gondii.*
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Both drugs are well-absorbed orally.
    - **Metabolism:** Pyrimethamine is metabolized to several metabolites.
    - **Elimination:** Both drugs have long elimination half-lives (approximately 100 hours for pyrimethamine and 200 hours for sulfadoxine).  Excretion is primarily renal.
- **Mode of Action:**  Sequential blockade of folic acid synthesis pathway.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Dihydrofolate reductase inhibition (Pyrimethamine) and dihydropteroate synthase inhibition (Sulfamethoxazole)
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Malaria Treatment:** 2-3 tablets (equivalent to 50-75 mg pyrimethamine and 1000-1500 mg sulfadoxine) as a single dose, often following a course of quinine.
- **Malaria Prophylaxis:** 1 tablet weekly or 2 tablets every two weeks, starting 1-2 days before travel to an endemic area and continuing for 4-6 weeks after return.
- **Intermittent Preventive Treatment of Malaria in Pregnancy (IPTp):** 3 tablets as a single dose at monthly intervals during the second and third trimesters (at least one month apart), ideally under directly observed therapy (DOT).

#### **Children:**

- **Malaria Treatment:** Dosage based on weight (see source material for specific recommendations) and may be preceded by a course of quinine.
- **Malaria Prophylaxis:** Dosage based on weight (see source material for specific recommendations).
- **Perennial Malaria Chemoprevention:** Dosage based on weight and should be administered at least monthly to children up to 24 months old in eligible areas. For children under 5 kg an alternate formulation needs to be used.  Children above 5 kg may receive half a tablet.
- **Children less than 2 months:** Contraindicated.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution; dose adjustment may be necessary due to potential reduced hepatic and renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; dose adjustment may be necessary. Contraindicated for repeated prophylactic use in patients with renal failure.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution; dose adjustment may be necessary. Contraindicated for repeated prophylactic use in patients with hepatic failure.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor carefully for adverse effects, particularly in patients with HIV infection taking co-trimoxazole, G6PD deficiency, blood disorders, or those with pre-existing folate deficiency.  Do not use in combination with co-trimoxazole.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation:** Not specifically indicated.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Not specifically indicated for surgical prophylaxis.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not specifically indicated.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  May be used in the ICU setting for treatment or prophylaxis of PCP if other options are unsuitable, but this is not a common indication.
- **Emergency Situations:** Not typically used in most emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- **Renal/Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment may be required; contraindicated for repeated prophylactic use in patients with renal or hepatic failure.
- **Metabolic Disorders:** Use cautiously in patients with G6PD deficiency due to the risk of hemolytic anemia.
- **Genetic Polymorphisms:**  No specific adjustments outlined in the provided sources.
