      Is Rabeprazole + Zinc Carnosine a treatment for *H. pylori* infection?**


      **A:** While not a primary treatment, it can be used in conjunction with
      antibiotics for the treatment of *H. pylori* infections. This can help
      reduce stomach acidity and create a more favorable environment for
      antibiotic action.  It is sometimes used as part of a combination therapy
      that includes antibiotics.

## **Usage**

- Rabeprazole + Zinc Carnosine is prescribed for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcers (gastric and duodenal), and pathological hypersecretory conditions like Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.  Zinc Carnosine also aids in healing gastric erosions.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Rabeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and Zinc Carnosine is a gastroprotective agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Rabeprazole inhibits the H+/K+ ATPase pump in gastric parietal cells, thereby reducing gastric acid secretion. Zinc Carnosine forms a protective barrier on the stomach lining, facilitating ulcer healing. It also possesses anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.

## **Alternate Names**

- Rabeprazole sodium + Zinc L-carnosine
- **Brand Names:** Rabosure, Rablet Z, Rabez Z, Carnozol, Happi XT, Rabecar


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Rabeprazole, by inhibiting the proton pump, effectively suppresses gastric acid secretion.  Zinc Carnosine exerts local effects on the gastric mucosa, promoting healing and reducing inflammation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Rabeprazole is absorbed systemically and metabolized by the liver (CYP450 enzymes), primarily CYP2C19 and CYP3A4.  Zinc Carnosine, on the other hand, largely exerts its effects locally in the gastrointestinal tract, with minimal systemic absorption. The zinc component is absorbed and follows the normal pathways for zinc metabolism. L-carnosine is broken down into beta-alanine and L-histidine and used for protein synthesis. It is excreted primarily through renal pathways as metabolites.
- **Mode of Action:** Rabeprazole binds irreversibly to the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme, blocking the final step of acid production. Zinc carnosine stabilizes mucosal integrity, promotes ulcer healing, and exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Rabeprazole inhibits H+/K+ ATPase. Zinc Carnosine stabilizes cell membranes. It also increases the expression of antioxidant enzymes in the gastric mucosa, defending mucosal cells against reactive oxygen species and decreasing the expression of inflammatory cytokines. It also promotes the expression of growth factors.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Rabeprazole is primarily metabolized by the liver and excreted in urine and feces. The zinc component is also subject to hepatic metabolism. L-carnosine, following its breakdown, sees its components excreted in urine and feces, with a small proportion of the zinc excreted through the kidneys.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- One 20 mg rabeprazole / 75 mg zinc carnosine capsule or tablet once daily, taken before a meal.
- The treatment duration is condition-dependent and determined by patient response.

#### **Children:**

- Not routinely recommended for children below 12. Limited data exists for rabeprazole alone in children older than one year for GERD, with dosages adjusted based on weight. Consult a pediatric gastroenterologist.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustment is generally not necessary unless significant renal or hepatic impairment is present.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is usually needed for mild to moderate impairment. Consider reducing the dose in cases of severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised in patients with heart conditions, osteoporosis, hypomagnesemia, or a history of breast cancer. 

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The available sources did not provide dosage guidelines for the specific clinical use cases requested (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations). These scenarios may not routinely utilize Rabeprazole + Zinc Carnosine.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be needed in patients with renal/hepatic impairment, metabolic disorders, or specific genetic polymorphisms affecting CYP450 enzymes involved in the drug's metabolism.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Headache
- Diarrhea
- Nausea
- Flatulence

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to rabeprazole, zinc carnosine, or any component of the formulation.
- Patients with a known allergy to substituted benzimidazoles.
-  Patients with prolactinoma.
-  Severe liver impairment.

## **Drug Interactions**

-  Some antibiotics (e.g., quinolones, tetracyclines): separate doses by 2 hours.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Rabeprazole is classified as Pregnancy Category C, as there is limited human data available. There is no safety data available for Zinc Carnosine. Use should only be considered if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus. Omeprazole is generally preferred during pregnancy due to more extensive safety data. 
- **Breastfeeding:**  Safety during breastfeeding has not been established.  Use with caution and under medical supervision. The effect on nursing infants is unknown.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Rabeprazole inhibits gastric acid secretion; Zinc Carnosine protects the gastric mucosa.

- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, Prolactinoma
- **Drug Interactions:** Clopidogrel, Levothyroxine, Methotrexate, Ketoconazole/itraconazole
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; limited safety data.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 20mg/75mg once daily before meals.  Pediatric use not recommended.
