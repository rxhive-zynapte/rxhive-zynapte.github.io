      What is the recommended dosage for Racecadotril + Saccharomyces
      boulardii?**


      **A:** Adult dosing is typically Racecadotril 100mg three times daily and
      *S. boulardii* 250mg twice daily. Pediatric Racecadotril dosing is
      weight-based at 1.5 mg/kg three times daily. Dosage may vary based on the

      How does Racecadotril differ from loperamide in managing diarrhea?**


      **A:** Racecadotril is an antisecretory agent, while loperamide is an
      antimotility agent.  Racecadotril reduces intestinal fluid secretion,
      whereas loperamide slows intestinal transit. Racecadotril is associated
      with a lower risk of constipation compared to loperamide.

## **Usage**

Racecadotril + *Saccharomyces boulardii* is primarily prescribed for the treatment of acute diarrhea in adults and children over three months of age.  It is particularly effective in cases of acute watery diarrhea, traveler's diarrhea, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

This combination medication falls under the pharmacological classifications of antidiarrheal (Racecadotril) and probiotic (*Saccharomyces boulardii*).  

Racecadotril acts as an enkephalinase inhibitor, reducing intestinal hypersecretion by preventing the breakdown of enkephalins. *Saccharomyces boulardii*, a non-pathogenic yeast, helps restore the balance of intestinal flora.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no officially recognized alternate name for the combination product itself. However, the individual components are known by various names:

* **Racecadotril:** Acetorphan
* **Saccharomyces boulardii:** *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* var. *boulardii*, Ultra-Levure (brand name varies by region)


Several brand names exist for the combined formulation, which can differ depending on the region and manufacturer. Some of them are Racigyl-SB, Hidrasec SB, and Tiorfix SB.

## **How It Works**

**Racecadotril:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Racecadotril's antidiarrheal effect is achieved through the inhibition of enkephalinase, an enzyme that degrades enkephalins.  Enkephalins are naturally occurring peptides that regulate intestinal water and electrolyte secretion. By preventing their breakdown, Racecadotril reduces the excessive secretion of water and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen, thus decreasing the fluidity and volume of stools. This mechanism is independent of opioid receptors and therefore avoids the adverse effects associated with opioid-based antidiarrheal medications.

* **Pharmacokinetics:**  Racecadotril is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. It is metabolized into the active metabolite thiorphan, which is responsible for its enkephalinase-inhibiting action.  Thiorphan is primarily eliminated via renal excretion.

**Saccharomyces boulardii:**

* **Pharmacodynamics:**  *Saccharomyces boulardii* exerts its beneficial effects through various mechanisms, including:
    * Production of enzymes that degrade bacterial toxins.
    * Stimulation of the immune system within the gut.
    * Enhancing nutrient absorption.
    * Promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria.
    * Competing with pathogenic bacteria for resources and adhesion sites.

* **Pharmacokinetics:** *Saccharomyces boulardii* is not absorbed systemically; it remains within the gastrointestinal tract and is eliminated in the feces.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The recommended dose of Racecadotril for adults is 100mg three times a day, taken with or without food. *Saccharomyces boulardii* for adults is usually dosed at 250mg twice daily. Combination products may vary.

#### **Children:**

Racecadotril dosage for children is weight-based and is usually given three times daily.  The usual starting dose is 1.5 mg/kg per dose. Children weighing <9kg may receive 10mg per dose, 9-13 kg may receive 20mg per dose, and children 13-27kg may receive 30mg per dose.  Children >27kg may receive 60mg per dose. Treatment is continued until two normal stools are passed.  The maximum duration of treatment is generally 7 days. The recommended dosages for *Saccharomyces boulardii* may vary from region to region but are often the same for children and adults.



#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution should be exercised due to limited data; dosage adjustment may be necessary. Avoid use in children with renal impairment.
