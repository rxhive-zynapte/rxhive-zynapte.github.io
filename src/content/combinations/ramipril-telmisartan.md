## **Usage**

- Ramipril + Telmisartan is prescribed for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults. It is also used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke in patients 55 years or older with a high risk of major cardiovascular events who cannot take ACE inhibitors.  
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Ramipril is an Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and Telmisartan is an Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB).  They both belong to the class of Antihypertensives.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Ramipril blocks the formation of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, leading to vasodilation and reduced blood pressure. Telmisartan blocks the action of angiotensin II at its receptor sites, further contributing to vasodilation and blood pressure reduction.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names for this fixed-dose combination medication exist.
- **Brand names:** Micardis HCT, Twynsta.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ramipril reduces blood pressure by inhibiting the formation of angiotensin II, leading to vasodilation and reduced aldosterone secretion. Telmisartan blocks the binding of angiotensin II to its receptors, further enhancing vasodilation.  The combination provides synergistic blood pressure reduction.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Ramipril is rapidly absorbed and converted to its active metabolite, ramiprilat. Telmisartan is well-absorbed but has low bioavailability due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Both drugs are primarily eliminated via the kidneys and liver. 
- **Mode of Action:** Ramipril inhibits ACE, preventing the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Telmisartan blocks the AT1 receptor, preventing angiotensin II from binding and exerting its vasoconstricting effects.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Ramipril inhibits ACE. Telmisartan acts as an AT1 receptor antagonist.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Ramipril is excreted by the kidneys (primarily as ramiprilat) and liver (as ramipril and glucuronide conjugates). Telmisartan is mainly eliminated in feces via biliary excretion, with a small amount excreted unchanged in the urine.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: Ramipril 2.5 mg + Telmisartan 40 mg once daily.
- Maintenance dose: Ramipril 2.5-10 mg + Telmisartan 40-80 mg, as a single daily dose or in two divided doses depending on response and tolerability.
- For cardiovascular risk reduction: Ramipril 2.5mg titrated up to 10mg over 4 weeks + Telmisartan 80 mg once daily.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for children below 18 years of age as safety and efficacy have not been established.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate with a lower Ramipril dose (1.25 mg) and titrate slowly. Monitor renal function closely.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Lower Ramipril starting dose recommended based on creatinine clearance. Avoid use in severe renal impairment. No dosage adjustment is typically needed for Telmisartan in mild to moderate renal impairment; a lower starting dose (20 mg) is recommended in severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** A lower starting dose of Telmisartan (40 mg) is recommended.  Use with caution. Ramipril dosage adjustments may not be necessary, but close monitoring is advised.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with heart failure, diabetes, or other conditions that may affect renal function.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  

- Not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its primary role is in chronic management of hypertension and cardiovascular risk reduction.

### **Dosage Adjustments**  

- Dose adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient factors such as renal function, hepatic function, other medications, and response to therapy.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Dizziness, lightheadedness
- Headache
- Dry cough (Ramipril)
- Diarrhea
- Fatigue
- Back pain (Telmisartan)
- Sinus pain and congestion (Telmisartan)


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Angioedema (swelling of face, lips, tongue, throat)
- Hypotension (low blood pressure)
- Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels)
- Renal impairment (kidney problems)
- Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Potential for renal damage with prolonged use, especially in patients with pre-existing renal disease.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Angioedema requires immediate discontinuation of the medication and emergency medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to ramipril, telmisartan, or any component of the medication.
- History of angioedema related to ACE inhibitors or ARBs.
- Pregnancy (especially second and third trimesters).
- Bilateral renal artery stenosis.
- Concomitant use with aliskiren in patients with diabetes.


## **Drug Interactions**

- NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen): May reduce the antihypertensive effect and increase the risk of renal impairment.
- Potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone): May increase the risk of hyperkalemia.
- Lithium: May increase lithium levels.
- Digoxin: May increase digoxin levels.
- Aliskiren: Contraindicated in patients with diabetes.
- Other antihypertensives: Additive effects on blood pressure.
- Alcohol: May enhance dizziness and hypotension.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Category D (first trimester), Category X (second and third trimesters). Contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of fetal harm.
- **Breastfeeding:** Not recommended as ramipril and telmisartan may pass into breast milk.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** ACE inhibitor (ramipril) and ARB (telmisartan) acting synergistically to lower blood pressure.
- **Side Effects:** Dizziness, headache, cough, diarrhea, fatigue, angioedema, hypotension, hyperkalemia, renal impairment.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, pregnancy, bilateral renal artery stenosis.
- **Drug Interactions:** NSAIDs, potassium-sparing diuretics, lithium, digoxin, aliskiren.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy; not recommended while breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** Adults: Ramipril 2.5-10 mg + Telmisartan 40-80 mg once daily or in divided doses.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, renal function, potassium levels.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Commonly used as a fixed-dose combination. Addition of a thiazide diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) may be considered for enhanced blood pressure control if needed.

## **Precautions**

- Monitor renal function and potassium levels, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney disease, heart failure, or diabetes.
- Correct volume or salt depletion before initiating therapy.
- Caution in patients with hepatic impairment.
- Advise patients to avoid alcohol, driving or operating machinery if experiencing dizziness.
