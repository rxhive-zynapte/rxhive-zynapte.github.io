      How does this combination work in managing blood sugar?**

      **A:** It works by reducing glucose reabsorption in the kidneys
      (Remogliflozin) and by increasing insulin release and reducing glucagon
      secretion (Teneligliptin), ultimately leading to better blood sugar
      control.

## **Usage**

- This fixed-dose combination (FDC) medication is prescribed for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in adults, specifically when diet and exercise alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications do not provide adequate glycemic control.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antidiabetic;  Dual SGLT2 inhibitor (Remogliflozin Etabonate) and DPP-4 inhibitor (Teneligliptin).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Remogliflozin Etabonate inhibits sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) in the kidneys, reducing glucose reabsorption and increasing urinary glucose excretion. Teneligliptin inhibits dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), which increases the levels of incretin hormones like GLP-1 and GIP, thereby enhancing insulin secretion and decreasing glucagon secretion.  The combined effect lowers both fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination.
- **Brand Names:** Zita Plus-R, and other brand names may exist depending on region.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Remogliflozin Etabonate increases urinary glucose excretion, leading to a reduction in plasma glucose levels. Teneligliptin enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppresses glucagon secretion, improving glycemic control without promoting weight gain.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Remogliflozin Etabonate is a prodrug rapidly metabolized to remogliflozin. It is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, with minor contributions from CYP2C19. It has a short half-life.
    - Teneligliptin is metabolized by CYP3A4 and FMO3 and is also excreted unchanged in the urine.
    -  Due to multiple elimination pathways (renal and hepatic), dosage adjustment is usually not necessary in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
- **Mode of Action:** Remogliflozin Etabonate acts on SGLT2 receptors in the renal proximal tubules, blocking glucose reabsorption.  Teneligliptin inhibits the DPP-4 enzyme, preventing the degradation of incretin hormones, which in turn modulate pancreatic islet cell function to increase insulin release and decrease glucagon release.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Remogliflozin is primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism (CYP3A4), with minor renal excretion. Teneligliptin is eliminated through both renal and hepatic routes (CYP3A4 and FMO3 metabolism, and urinary excretion).

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial: 100mg Remogliflozin Etabonate + 20mg Teneligliptin once daily, taken orally after a meal.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for use in children as safety and efficacy have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be required. Close monitoring for hypoglycemia, renal function, and electrolytes is advised.
