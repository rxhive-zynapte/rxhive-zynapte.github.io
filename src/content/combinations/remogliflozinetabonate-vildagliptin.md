## **Usage**

- Remogliflozin Etabonate + Vildagliptin is prescribed for the treatment of **Type 2 diabetes mellitus** in adults over 18 years of age, as an adjunct to diet and exercise. It is specifically indicated for patients whose blood sugar levels are inadequately controlled with Metformin alone or in combination with other antidiabetic agents. It is *not* indicated for Type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antidiabetic combination drug;  specifically a combination of a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (Remogliflozin Etabonate) and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor (Vildagliptin).
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination works through two distinct mechanisms:
    * **Remogliflozin Etabonate:** Inhibits SGLT2 in the kidneys, blocking glucose reabsorption and increasing its excretion in urine, thereby lowering blood glucose levels.
    * **Vildagliptin:** Inhibits DPP-4, an enzyme that breaks down incretin hormones. This leads to increased levels of incretins, which stimulate insulin release and decrease glucagon secretion, further contributing to blood glucose control.

## **Alternate Names**

While there are no official alternate names for the combination itself, the individual components have chemical names:
- Remogliflozin etabonate: (2S,3R,4R,5S,6R)-2-[4-chloro-3-(4-ethoxybenzyl)phenyl]-6-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3,4,5-triol 1,3,4,5-tetraacetate.
- Vildagliptin: (2S)-1-[(3-hydroxy-1-adamantyl)amino]acetyl-2-pyrrolidinecarbonitrile.

Some **brand names** under which this fixed-dose combination is marketed include Remo V, Remozen-V, and others (the availability of specific brands may vary regionally).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The combined effect of remogliflozin and vildagliptin results in a significant reduction in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) levels. Remogliflozin also has a modest blood pressure-lowering effect and can contribute to weight loss.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  
    * **Absorption:** Both drugs are orally absorbed.
    * **Metabolism:** Remogliflozin is primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP enzymes (mainly CYP2C8 and CYP3A4). Vildagliptin is primarily metabolized by hydrolysis to its inactive metabolite. A small portion is also metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4.
    * **Elimination:** Remogliflozin is eliminated through both renal and hepatic routes, with urine being the primary route. Vildagliptin is primarily eliminated renally, with a small portion eliminated in feces.
- **Mode of Action:** 
    * **Remogliflozin:** Acts by directly binding to and inhibiting SGLT2 in the renal proximal tubules, preventing glucose reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate back into the bloodstream.
    * **Vildagliptin:** Acts by binding to and inhibiting DPP-4, thereby increasing the concentration of incretin hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). These hormones enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppress glucagon secretion, and slow gastric emptying.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The recommended starting dose is Remogliflozin 100 mg + Vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily, taken orally with meals.
- The dose may be adjusted based on the patient's glycemic control and tolerability. The maximum recommended dose of remogliflozin is 200 mg twice daily, while the maximum dose of vildagliptin is 100 mg daily (either as 50 mg twice daily or 100 mg once daily).

#### **Children:**

- This combination is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age, as safety and efficacy have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Dosage should be initiated cautiously, starting with the lowest dose and gradually titrated upwards based on the patient's renal function and glycemic control.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** The dose should be adjusted based on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Remogliflozin is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m²). Vildagliptin dose reduction is recommended for moderate to severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution should be exercised in patients with hepatic impairment. Remogliflozin dose reduction is recommended for moderate to severe hepatic impairment. Vildagliptin can generally be used without dose adjustment in mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Care should be taken when using this combination in patients with cardiovascular disease, especially those at risk of hypotension or those using diuretics. Close monitoring of blood pressure is recommended.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The combination of remogliflozin and vildagliptin is not specifically indicated for use in settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest. Its primary use is in the chronic management of type 2 diabetes.


### **Dosage Adjustments**
Dose adjustments should be made based on patient-specific factors like renal or hepatic dysfunction, other comorbid conditions, and concomitant medications.

## **Side Effects**

- Upper respiratory tract infections
- Nasopharyngitis
- Headache

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
- Acute pancreatitis
- Severe hypoglycemia
- Angioedema
-  Hypotension (low blood pressure)
-  Volume depletion/dehydration

### **Long-Term Effects**
- Increased risk of bone fractures (with SGLT2 inhibitors)
- Potential for renal impairment (requiring regular monitoring)


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Any instance of  angioedema, severe hypoglycemia, DKA, or acute pancreatitis should be considered serious and warrants immediate discontinuation of the drug and appropriate medical intervention.
