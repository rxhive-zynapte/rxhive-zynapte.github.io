## **Usage**

- S-Amlodipine + Telmisartan is prescribed for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure).  It is used when a single medication is not enough to control blood pressure.  This combination may also indirectly reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes in individuals at risk.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antihypertensive (a combination of a calcium channel blocker and an angiotensin II receptor blocker).
- **Mechanism of Action:** This combination medication works by two distinct mechanisms. S-Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, widens blood vessels by relaxing their smooth muscles, which eases blood flow.  Telmisartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), prevents the hormone angiotensin II from constricting blood vessels. Together, these actions lower blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

- This combination is often referred to as the S-Amlodipine + Telmisartan fixed-dose combination (FDC).
- **Brand Names:**  Several brands market this combination, such as Twynsta and Numlo TM. Regional variations in brand names may exist.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** S-Amlodipine primarily affects the vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle by blocking calcium influx, thus reducing vascular tone.  Telmisartan blocks the action of angiotensin II at its receptor sites, preventing vasoconstriction and aldosterone release.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Both drugs are orally absorbed. Telmisartan shows an absolute bioavailability of approximately 50%, while S-amlodipine's bioavailability is around 60-65%. Food intake does not significantly affect either drug's absorption.
    - **Metabolism:**  Telmisartan undergoes minimal metabolism, while S-Amlodipine is extensively metabolized by the liver, primarily by CYP3A4 enzymes.
    - **Elimination:**  Telmisartan is primarily eliminated via biliary excretion in feces, whereas S-Amlodipine is mostly excreted in urine and feces as metabolites, with a longer half-life than Telmisartan.
- **Mode of Action:**  S-Amlodipine blocks the influx of calcium ions into vascular and cardiac muscle cells. Telmisartan blocks angiotensin II at the AT1 receptor, thus preventing vasoconstriction, reducing aldosterone secretion, and lowering blood pressure. 
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** S-Amlodipine acts on L-type calcium channels. Telmisartan competitively binds to the AT1 receptor.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Telmisartan is primarily excreted unchanged in bile. S-Amlodipine is extensively metabolized by hepatic CYP3A4 enzymes, and metabolites are excreted in urine and feces.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: S-Amlodipine 2.5 mg + Telmisartan 40 mg once daily.
- Maintenance dose:  The dose may be increased to a maximum of S-Amlodipine 5 mg + Telmisartan 80 mg once daily, as needed and tolerated.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for patients under 18 years of age. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients (over 75 years):**  Initial therapy with this combination is not recommended. If used, start with a low dose of S-Amlodipine and titrate slowly.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Mild to moderate impairment: no adjustment needed. Severe impairment: titrate slowly with close monitoring.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Not recommended for initial therapy. In cases of biliary obstructive disorders, initiate therapy with a low dose and titrate cautiously.

- Concurrent use with aliskiren in patients with diabetes.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Other antihypertensives (may potentiate hypotension).
- CYP3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole) and inducers (rifampicin) may alter S-Amlodipine levels.
- NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) may reduce antihypertensive effect and increase the risk of renal impairment.
- Lithium (increased lithium toxicity).
- Digoxin (increased digoxin levels).
- Grapefruit juice (may increase S-Amlodipine levels).
- Potassium supplements (may cause hyperkalemia).
- Alcohol (may increase the risk of hypotension).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** D (Australia); Not assigned (US FDA, as categories are being phased out). Contraindicated during pregnancy, especially the second and third trimesters, due to the risk of fetal harm.
- Fetal risks include fetotoxicity, intrauterine death, and neonatal morbidity.
- Not recommended during breastfeeding as S-Amlodipine is known to be excreted in breast milk, and the effects of Telmisartan on infants are unknown.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** S-Amlodipine: calcium channel blocker; Telmisartan: angiotensin II receptor blocker.
- **Side Effects:** Dizziness, headache, edema, fatigue, nausea.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, pregnancy, breastfeeding, severe hepatic impairment, biliary obstructive disorders.
- **Drug Interactions:** Other antihypertensives, CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers, NSAIDs, lithium, digoxin, grapefruit juice, alcohol.
