## **Usage**

- Sacubitril + Valsartan is prescribed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for adults with chronic heart failure (CHF) and children aged 1 year and older with symptomatic heart failure with systemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction. It is most effective in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below normal.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Sacubitril + Valsartan has a dual mechanism: Sacubitril inhibits neprilysin, which increases the levels of natriuretic peptides (NPs). NPs have vasodilatory, natriuretic, and diuretic effects. Valsartan blocks the angiotensin II receptor, preventing vasoconstriction and reducing aldosterone secretion.

## **Alternate Names**

-  International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Sacubitril/Valsartan.
- **Brand Name:** Entresto, Entresto Sprinkle.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Sacubitril increases the levels of vasoactive peptides, promoting vasodilation and diuresis. Valsartan blocks the deleterious effects of angiotensin II, preventing vasoconstriction and reducing aldosterone release. This dual action decreases cardiac workload and improves hemodynamics.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Both sacubitril and valsartan are orally absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations reached within 0.5-2 hours for sacubitril and its active metabolite (LBQ657), and 1.5 hours for valsartan. Food doesn't significantly affect absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Sacubitril is metabolized to LBQ657, its active metabolite.  Valsartan is minimally metabolized.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion for LBQ657 and a combination of hepatic metabolism and renal excretion for valsartan.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Initial Dose:** 49 mg sacubitril/51 mg valsartan orally twice daily.
- **Target Maintenance Dose:** After 2-4 weeks, increase to 97 mg sacubitril/103 mg valsartan twice daily, as tolerated.

#### **Children (≥1 year):**

- Dose based on body weight, administered orally twice daily. Titration every 2-4 weeks, as tolerated.
- **<40 kg:**  Recommended mg/kg doses of combined sacubitril and valsartan. An extemporaneously compounded oral suspension (4 mg/mL sacubitril/valsartan, 1.96 mg/mL sacubitril and 2.04mg/mL valsartan) is available. 
    - Starting dose: 1.6 mg/kg BID.
    - Second titration: 2.3 mg/kg BID.
    - Maximum dose: 3.1 mg/kg BID.
- **≥40 kg and <50 kg:**
    - Starting dose: 24 mg/26 mg BID.
    - Second titration: 49 mg/51 mg BID.
    - Maximum dose: 72 mg/78 mg BID.
- **≥50 kg:**
    - Starting dose: 49 mg/51 mg BID.
    - Second titration: 72 mg/78 mg BID.
    - Maximum dose: 97 mg/103 mg BID.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients (≥75 years):** Consider a lower starting dose (24/26 mg twice daily).
- **Renal Impairment:**
    - Mild-to-moderate (eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m²): No initial dose adjustment.
    - Severe (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m²): Reduce starting dose to 24/26 mg BID, titrate as tolerated.
- **Hepatic Impairment:**
    - Mild (Child-Pugh A): No initial dose adjustment.
    - Moderate (Child-Pugh B):  Reduce starting dose to 24/26 mg BID, titrate as tolerated.
    - Severe (Child-Pugh C): Not recommended.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Dosages for specific medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not specifically defined for sacubitril/valsartan.  Treat CHF according to standard guidelines based on the patient's clinical status and the provided dosage adjustments.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Hypotension, dizziness, lightheadedness
- Cough
- Hyperkalemia
- Renal impairment

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Angioedema
- Renal failure

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Angioedema requires immediate discontinuation of the drug and appropriate medical intervention.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to sacubitril or valsartan.
- History of angioedema related to ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy.
- Concomitant use of ACE inhibitors.
- Concomitant use of aliskiren in patients with diabetes or renal impairment (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m²).
- Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis, cholestasis (Child-Pugh C).
- Pregnancy (second and third trimesters).

## **Drug Interactions**

- ACE Inhibitors: Contraindicated due to increased risk of angioedema. A 36-hour washout period is required when switching between ACE inhibitors and sacubitril/valsartan.
- ARBs: Avoid concomitant use as valsartan is an ARB.
- Aliskiren: Contraindicated in patients with diabetes or renal impairment.
- Potassium-sparing diuretics:  May increase the risk of hyperkalemia.
- Statins: Sacubitril can inhibit OATP transporters, potentially increasing statin exposure. Monitor cholesterol levels and adjust statin dose as needed.
- PDE5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil): May increase the risk of hypotension.
- OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, and MRP2 substrates:  Concomitant use with inhibitors of these transporters may increase exposure to LBQ657 or valsartan.
- Lithium: Increased lithium levels may occur. Monitor lithium levels closely.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Contraindicated during the second and third trimesters due to the risk of fetal harm. Not recommended during the first trimester.
- **Breastfeeding:** Not recommended due to potential risk to the newborn.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
