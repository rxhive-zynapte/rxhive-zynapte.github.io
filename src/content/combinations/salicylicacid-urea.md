## **Usage**

Salicylic Acid + Urea is prescribed for various dermatological conditions characterized by dry, scaly, or thickened skin. These include:

* **Eczema:** An inflammatory skin condition causing redness, itching, and inflammation.
* **Psoriasis:** An autoimmune disease leading to scaly, itchy patches on the skin.
* **Acne:** A skin condition where hair follicles become clogged with oil and dead skin cells.
* **Keratosis:** Rough, scaly patches on the skin.
* **Calluses:** Thickened layers of skin, often on the hands or feet.
* **Warts:** Small, fleshy bumps on the skin.
* **Onychomycosis:** Fungal nail infections.
* **Xerosis (Dry Skin):**  A condition characterized by rough, dry, and itchy skin.
* **Ichthyosis:** A group of genetic skin disorders resulting in dry, scaly skin.
* **Keratoderma:** A thickening of the skin on the palms and soles.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Keratolytic, Emollient, Humectant

**Mechanism of Action:** Salicylic acid is a keratolytic agent that breaks down the bonds between skin cells, promoting exfoliation and shedding of the stratum corneum. Urea is a humectant, drawing moisture into the skin and softening keratin, further enhancing exfoliation. The combination increases skin moisture, removes scales, and decreases itching and flaking. Urea also has some antimicrobial properties.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for the combination product itself. Individual components may be referred to as:

* **Salicylic acid:** 2-Hydroxybenzoic acid
* **Urea:** Carbamide

**Brand Names:**  Salicure, Kerasal, Carb-O-Sal5, Salvax Duo, Salvax Duo Plus (and many others depending upon the specific concentrations and the manufacturer).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Salicylic acid exerts its keratolytic action by increasing skin hydration and dissolving the intercellular "cement" substance, which promotes desquamation of the stratum corneum. Urea acts as a humectant, drawing water into the stratum corneum, which softens keratin and facilitates exfoliation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Topical absorption varies depending on factors like the concentration, vehicle used (cream, ointment, lotion), and the condition of the skin. Occlusive dressings can increase absorption.
* **Metabolism:** Some salicylic acid may be metabolized in the skin. Urea is primarily metabolized in the liver.
* **Elimination:** Salicylic acid is primarily excreted by the kidneys. Urea is also mainly excreted by the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** At a cellular level, salicylic acid increases the pH of the stratum corneum, disrupting hydrogen bonding within keratin filaments, thereby loosening the connections between corneocytes and promoting their detachment. Urea enhances this process by increasing hydration, further softening the keratin.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Salicylic acid does not have any significant receptor binding, neurotransmitter modulation, or enzymatic inhibition relevant to its topical keratolytic effect. Urea's mechanism primarily involves its humectant properties.


## **Dosage**

Dosage varies greatly depending on the formulation, concentration, and the specific skin condition being treated.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* Application frequency: Typically applied once or twice daily, or as directed by a physician.
* Concentration: Varies from product to product (e.g., 2-40% urea and 2-10% salicylic acid).

#### **Children:**

* Use in children younger than 2 years is generally not recommended due to increased risk of systemic absorption and skin irritation.
* For children older than 2 years, lower concentrations are generally recommended, and the use should be under the supervision of a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Similar to adult dosing but with careful monitoring for skin irritation.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised due to the potential for increased systemic absorption of urea, especially if used on large areas or under occlusion. Dosage adjustment may be required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, especially for salicylic acid, though topical application poses less risk than systemic administration. Monitor for signs of salicylism.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Diabetes and peripheral vascular disease can affect skin integrity and healing. Careful monitoring is required.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Salicylic acid + urea combinations are not typically used in acute clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Their primary role is in the management of chronic dermatological conditions.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on the severity of the skin condition, patient tolerability, and the presence of renal/hepatic dysfunction. Start with lower concentrations and increase as needed, under medical supervision.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**
* Burning sensation
* Itching
* Irritation at the application site
* Dryness
* Redness
* Peeling

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Allergic reactions (hives, difficulty breathing, swelling)
* Severe skin irritation or rash
* Salicylism (with excessive application or occlusion): headache, tinnitus, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion.

### **Long-Term Effects**

* Skin atrophy (with prolonged use of high concentrations or overuse)
* Increased risk of skin infections if applied to broken or damaged skin.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to salicylic acid or urea
* Open wounds or infections at the application site
* Use in children under 2 years of age is generally avoided.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Methotrexate:**  Concurrent use can increase methotrexate levels and toxicity.
* **Other Salicylates/Aspirin:** Increased risk of salicylism.
* **Oral Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin):**  May enhance anticoagulant effect, although the risk is minimal with topical application.
* **Oral Hypoglycemics:** May potentially enhance the hypoglycemic effect.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Salicylic acid is a pregnancy category C drug. Use only if clearly needed and under medical supervision.  Topical use poses less risk compared to oral ingestion, but some systemic absorption may occur. Urea's safety during pregnancy is not fully established.
* **Breastfeeding:** It is unknown whether salicylic acid and urea are excreted in breast milk.  Use cautiously and only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the infant.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Keratolytic and humectant.
* **Side Effects:** Burning, itching, irritation, dryness, redness, allergic reaction.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, open wounds, children under 2.
* **Drug Interactions:** Methotrexate, other salicylates, anticoagulants, oral hypoglycemics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution under medical supervision.
* **Dosage:** Varies depending on formulation and condition; generally once or twice daily.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Observe for skin irritation, signs of infection, or salicylism.


## **Popular Combinations**

Salicylic acid and urea are often combined in topical preparations for synergistic keratolytic and moisturizing effects.  Other ingredients may be added, depending on the specific formulation.


## **Precautions**

* Apply only to affected areas.
* Avoid contact with eyes, mucous membranes, and open wounds.
* Monitor for signs of irritation or allergic reaction.
* Avoid use in children under 2.
* Caution in pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* Caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
* Avoid using occlusive dressings unless specifically directed by a physician, especially in children.
* Use sun protection when applying to areas exposed to sunlight.
