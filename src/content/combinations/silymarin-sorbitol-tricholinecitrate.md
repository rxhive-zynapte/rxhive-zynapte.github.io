## **Usage**

- This combination is prescribed to support liver health and function, particularly in conditions like fatty liver disease (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic), viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, and toxin-induced liver damage. It also aids in relieving constipation associated with liver ailments and may improve appetite.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Hepatoprotective, cholagogue, laxative.

## **Alternate Names**

- Silymarin + Tricholine Citrate + Sorbitol
- Mariliv
- Livolysin S
- Heptotal

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**
    - **Silymarin:** Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, and promotes liver cell regeneration.
    - **Tricholine Citrate:** Enhances liver function, acts as a bile acid-binding agent, lowers cholesterol levels.
    - **Sorbitol:** Osmotic laxative, improves palatability.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Silymarin:** Undergoes enterohepatic circulation, primarily eliminated in bile, interacts with CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 enzymes.
    - **Tricholine Citrate:** Metabolized in the liver, excreted by the kidneys.
    - **Sorbitol:** Mostly metabolized in the liver.

- **Mode of Action:**
    - **Silymarin:** Stabilizes liver cell membranes, scavenges free radicals, inhibits inflammation, stimulates liver regeneration.
    - **Tricholine Citrate:** Facilitates lipid metabolism and cell signaling.
    - **Sorbitol:** Draws water into the intestines, softening stools.

## **Dosage**

Dosage needs to be individualized based on the patient's age, weight, and specific medical condition. Always consult with a healthcare professional for appropriate dosing recommendations. The following are approximations from various sources and should not replace a physician's advice.

70-140 mg of Silymarin, 210-275 mg of Tricholine Citrate, and 500-1500 mg of Sorbitol, taken one to three times daily.  The formulation is usually an oral suspension.

#### **Children:**

Dosage for children must be determined by a physician. Some sources suggest 5-10 mg/kg/day of silymarin divided into 2-3 doses. For products containing sorbitol:
