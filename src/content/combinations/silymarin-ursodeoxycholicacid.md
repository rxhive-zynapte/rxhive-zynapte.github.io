## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** This combination is prescribed for various liver disorders, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcoholic liver disease, acute and chronic viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), gallstones, and Amanita mushroom poisoning. It's also used for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP).
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Hepatoprotective,  choleretic, and gallstone dissolution agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Silymarin acts as an antioxidant, stabilizing liver cell membranes and protecting against damage. Ursodeoxycholic acid, a naturally occurring bile acid, decreases cholesterol production and absorption, promoting gallstone dissolution and improving bile flow. Together they exhibit synergistic hepatoprotective effects, improving liver function tests and potentially histological findings in some conditions.


## **Alternate Names** 

Silymarin is sometimes called Milk Thistle. Ursodeoxycholic acid is also known as Ursodiol or UDCA. Brand names for this combination include Ursoplus, Urmed-Sl, and others.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Silymarin stabilizes liver cell membranes, acts as an antioxidant, and may exhibit anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Ursodeoxycholic acid modifies bile composition reducing cholesterol secretion and absorption, promoting gallstone dissolution. It also has immunomodulatory effects. 
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Silymarin is poorly absorbed orally and extensively metabolized, primarily via the liver. Ursodeoxycholic acid undergoes enterohepatic recirculation, is metabolized in the liver and excreted in both bile and urine.
- **Mode of Action:** Silymarin interacts with cell membranes, scavenging free radicals and modulating inflammatory pathways within liver cells. Ursodeoxycholic acid alters bile acid composition and transport, both protecting liver cells and improving bile flow.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Silymarin is primarily excreted in bile, while ursodeoxycholic acid is excreted in both bile and urine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

For NAFLD and other chronic liver diseases, a common dosage is one tablet/capsule containing 140 mg silymarin and 250-300 mg ursodeoxycholic acid two to three times daily, taken orally with food.  Dosages may vary based on the specific condition and brand.

#### **Children:**

Pediatric dosing is generally determined by body weight and the specific liver condition.  For cystic fibrosis-associated liver disease, a dosage of 20 mg/kg/day of ursodeoxycholic acid, divided into 2-3 doses, is often recommended. The dosage might be increased to 30mg/kg/day if necessary. Silymarin is generally not recommended for use in young children.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution and potential dose reduction are advised.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Careful monitoring is crucial; dosage adjustments may be needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient factors and potential drug interactions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Specific dosage recommendations for clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, and ICU use are not established for this specific drug combination, and treatment should be individualized according to the patient's specific condition and monitored by a physician. For emergency situations such as acute liver failure, dosage may vary widely based on severity and presentation.  Consult gastroenterology specialists for guidance.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications might be necessary due to factors like renal or hepatic dysfunction, concomitant medications, and individual response.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Diarrhea
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Abdominal discomfort
- Headache
- Skin rash or pruritus
- Dizziness
- Indigestion

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Severe allergic reactions
- Jaundice (worsening of liver function)


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Limited data are available on the long-term effects of combined use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
