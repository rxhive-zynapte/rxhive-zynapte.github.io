## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:**  Sodium Valproate + Valproic Acid is an anticonvulsant medication prescribed primarily for epilepsy (various seizure types, including generalized tonic-clonic, absence, and partial seizures), bipolar disorder (for managing manic episodes and preventing relapse), and migraine prevention.  It's sometimes used off-label for other conditions, but evidence for these uses may be limited.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Anticonvulsant, mood stabilizer.
- **Mechanism of Action:** The precise mechanism is not fully understood, but it's thought to involve multiple actions: increasing levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter; modulating voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, thus affecting neuronal excitability; and potentially impacting other neurotransmitter systems.

## **Alternate Names**

- **Alternate Names:** Valproate sodium, valproic acid, divalproex sodium
- **Brand Names:** Epilim, Depakene, Depakote, Stavzor, Depacon, Epilim Chrono, Epilim Chronosphere, Dyzantil.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Sodium valproate increases GABA levels in the brain, leading to enhanced inhibitory neurotransmission.  It also appears to block voltage-gated sodium channels, reducing the repetitive firing of neurons. Modulation of T-type calcium channels may also contribute to its anti-epileptic effects.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Sodium valproate is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration.  It is highly protein-bound, primarily to albumin.  Metabolism occurs extensively in the liver, mainly through glucuronidation and mitochondrial beta-oxidation.  Elimination is primarily through renal excretion of metabolites.  Valproic acid has a relatively short half-life (around 9-16 hours), necessitating multiple daily doses.
- **Mode of Action:** The drug increases GABAergic inhibition, probably by inhibiting GABA transaminase, the enzyme that breaks down GABA.  It also reduces neuronal excitability by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels.  This combination of actions reduces the likelihood of seizure activity.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Primarily inhibits GABA transaminase, thus increasing GABA availability.  Also modulates sodium and T-type calcium channels and potentially influences other neurotransmitter systems.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Mostly hepatic metabolism (glucuronidation and beta-oxidation) followed by renal excretion of metabolites. A small fraction is excreted unchanged in urine.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- **Epilepsy/Bipolar:** Initial 10-15 mg/kg/day orally, divided into 2-3 doses; increase weekly by 5-10 mg/kg/day until control is achieved or up to a maximum of 60 mg/kg/day. Dosage above 250mg should be divided.
- **Migraine Prevention:** 500-1000 mg/day orally, divided into 2-3 doses.


#### **Children:**
- **Epilepsy:**  Initial 10-15 mg/kg/day orally, divided into 1-2 doses (for children 2-11 years old). Increase weekly by 5-10 mg/kg/day as needed, with a maximum of 60 mg/kg/day or 12.5 to 15 mg/kg twice daily if needed, not exceeding 600mg twice daily. For children 12 years and over, refer to adult dosage recommendations.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and titrate cautiously, monitoring for adverse effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be necessary. Closely monitor renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in patients with significant hepatic impairment. Exercise caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Carefully assess patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or other conditions, as valproate may interact with other medications or exacerbate certain conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use/Emergency Situations:**  IV valproate sodium may be used for rapid control of seizures, especially in status epilepticus. 10-15 mg/kg IV over 1 hour, followed by continuous infusion or repeated doses, with maximum daily dose of 60 mg/kg/day. Do not administer IM due to risk of tissue necrosis. Transition to oral therapy as soon as possible.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary based on individual response, tolerability, plasma levels (if monitored), and the presence of renal or hepatic impairment. Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism might necessitate specific considerations.


## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects**
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tremor, weight gain, hair loss, dizziness, drowsiness, blurred/double vision, changes in menstrual periods, tinnitus.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Hepatotoxicity (especially in children under 2 years old), pancreatitis, hyperammonemic encephalopathy, thrombocytopenia,  leukopenia, suicidal ideation, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.


### **Long-Term Effects**
Polycystic ovary syndrome, bone mineral density reduction, cognitive impairment (with chronic use), peripheral neuropathy.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Severe hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, hyperammonemia, blood dyscrasias,  angioedema,  drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS).




## **Contraindications**

- **Absolute:** Known hypersensitivity, significant hepatic impairment, urea cycle disorders,  known or suspected mitochondrial disorders (especially Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome).
- **Relative:** Pregnancy (especially for migraine prevention), active liver disease, family history of liver dysfunction, porphyria.




## **Drug Interactions**
- **CYP450 Interactions:** Valproate inhibits CYP2C9, potentially increasing levels of drugs metabolized by this enzyme (e.g., warfarin, phenytoin). It is also metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.
- **Other Interactions:** Enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital) can decrease valproate levels.  Valproate may increase levels of lamotrigine and ethosuximide. Other interactions include those with carbapenems, salicylates, rifampicin, some antidepressants.
- **Food and Lifestyle Factors:** Alcohol may potentiate the sedative effects of valproate.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** D (according to the Australian classification) / X (according to the U.S. FDA classification for migraine prophylaxis)
- **Fetal Risks:**  High risk of neural tube defects (e.g., spina bifida), congenital malformations, developmental disorders (including cognitive deficits and autism spectrum disorder). High dose folic acid supplementation (5 mg/day) is recommended for women taking valproate who are considering or who become pregnant.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Valproate is excreted in breast milk, but at low levels. Breastfeeding is generally considered acceptable if closely monitored.  Observe the infant for sedation, hepatotoxicity, and bleeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Increases GABA levels, modulates sodium and calcium channels.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, tremor, weight gain, hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, suicidal thoughts.
- **Contraindications:** Liver disease, urea cycle disorders, mitochondrial disorders, pregnancy (for migraine prophylaxis).
- **Drug Interactions:** Enzyme-inducing antiepileptics, lamotrigine, warfarin, carbapenems.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** High risk of birth defects and developmental problems; use with caution during breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** Start low and titrate; adjust for age, renal/hepatic function.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests, complete blood count, ammonia levels, valproate serum levels (if indicated).



## **Popular Combinations**

Valproate is often used in combination with other antiepileptic drugs when monotherapy is insufficient. The choice of combination depends on the specific seizure type and patient characteristics.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Baseline liver function tests, complete blood count,  assessing for suicidal ideation.
- **Specific Populations:** Avoid in pregnancy (especially for migraine); cautious use in breastfeeding and in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Avoid alcohol.  May impair driving ability.
