## **Usage**

Sorbitol + Tricholine Citrate is primarily indicated for the management of liver disorders, particularly fatty liver disease (hepatic steatosis). It also serves as adjunctive therapy for improving liver function in cases of hepatotoxicity.  Additionally, it is used to relieve constipation and improve appetite, especially in patients with liver ailments.  It falls under the pharmacological classification of liver function improving medications and laxatives.

The mechanism of action involves two components: Tricholine citrate acts as a bile acid-binding agent, promoting the liver's use of cholesterol to produce more bile acids, thereby lowering cholesterol levels and breaking down hepatic fat deposits. Sorbitol functions as an osmotic laxative, drawing water into the large intestine to soften stools and stimulate bowel movements.

## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for this specific combination. However, the components are sometimes referred to as:

* **Sorbitol:**  D-glucitol
* **Tricholine Citrate:**  2-Hydroxy-N,N,N-trimethylethanaminium citrate

Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer. Some examples include Sorbiline and Tryboline.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Tricholine citrate lowers cholesterol and improves liver function by facilitating the conversion of hepatic fat deposits to beneficial cholesterol. Sorbitol increases water content in the stool, promoting bowel movements.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Oral administration is the typical route. Sorbitol is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, while tricholine citrate is absorbed more efficiently. Specific information on metabolism and elimination pathways of the combination is not available, however, sorbitol can convert to fructose. Sorbitol and tricholine are then excreted mainly through kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** Tricholine Citrate binds to bile acids, thereby depleting the bile acid pool in the body.  The body compensate for this by producing more bile acids from cholesterol. Bile acids consist of cholesterol and they are usually excreted from body in the feces. Sorbitol acts by osmosis, increasing the concentration of water in the large intestine, which softens the feces and stimulates defecation.

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation** are not the primary mechanism of action for this combination.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  10 ml twice daily before meals.

#### **Children:** 5 ml twice daily before meals for children. 2.5 ml twice daily before meals for infants.

#### **Special Cases:** Dosage adjustments in elderly patients, those with renal or hepatic impairment, or comorbid conditions should be made on a case-by-case basis. Limited specific information on dosage modifications based on these factors is available.
