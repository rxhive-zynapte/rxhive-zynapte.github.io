## **Usage**

- Sorbitol + Xylometazoline is prescribed for the temporary relief of nasal congestion associated with the common cold, hay fever, sinusitis, and other upper respiratory allergies.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Decongestant (Xylometazoline) and humectant (Sorbitol).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Xylometazoline is a sympathomimetic amine and alpha-adrenergic agonist that acts directly on alpha-adrenergic receptors in the nasal mucosa, causing vasoconstriction. This reduces blood flow to the nasal tissues, decreasing swelling and congestion. Sorbitol acts as a humectant, moisturizing the nasal passages and relieving dryness.

## **Alternate Names**

- Xylometazoline hydrochloride and Sorbitol
- No widely recognized international variations exist.  
- **Brand Names:** Otrivin Moist A (Moisturising Nasal Drops), Otrivin Moist P, Sinarest Nasal Spray, Sudafed Nasal Spray (contains xylometazoline but may not always include sorbitol).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Xylometazoline, as an alpha-adrenergic agonist, primarily stimulates alpha-1 adrenergic receptors in the nasal mucosa, leading to vasoconstriction. This reduces nasal blood flow, edema, and congestion. Sorbitol, a sugar alcohol, draws water into the nasal passages, moisturizing them and relieving dryness and irritation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Xylometazoline has minimal systemic absorption when administered intranasally. Sorbitol is also minimally absorbed from the nasal mucosa.
    - **Metabolism and Elimination:** Xylometazoline is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted through renal pathways. Sorbitol is minimally metabolized and predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine.
- **Mode of Action:** Xylometazoline exerts its decongestant effect by binding to alpha-1 adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle in the nasal mucosa, activating intracellular signaling pathways that ultimately lead to vasoconstriction. Sorbitol acts by creating an osmotic gradient that attracts water, thus moisturizing the nasal tissues. 
- **Elimination pathways:**  Primarily renal excretion, hepatic metabolism plays a minor role.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Nasal Drops: 2-4 drops in each nostril, up to 3 times daily.
- Nasal Spray: 1-2 sprays in each nostril, up to 3 times daily.

- Limit use to a maximum of 10 consecutive days to prevent rebound congestion.

#### **Children:**

- Age 1 to 5 years (under adult supervision): 1-2 drops of 0.05% solution in each nostril, once or twice daily (every 8 to 10 hours)
- Age 6 to 11 years (under adult supervision): 2-4 drops of 0.05% solution or 1-2 sprays in each nostril, 2 to 3 times daily as needed.
