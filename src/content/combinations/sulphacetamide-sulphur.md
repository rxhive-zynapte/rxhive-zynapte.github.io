## **Usage**

Sulphacetamide + Sulphur is prescribed for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris, acne rosacea, and seborrheic dermatitis.  It falls under the pharmacological classifications of keratolytic agent and sulfonamide antibiotic.  Sulfacetamide acts as a bacteriostatic agent, inhibiting bacterial growth by interfering with folic acid synthesis. Sulphur exerts keratolytic, antibacterial, and anti-fungal actions, promoting the shedding of dead skin cells, inhibiting *Cutibacterium acnes* growth, and reducing sebum production.


## **Alternate Names** 

While "Sulphacetamide + Sulphur" is a common generic name, variations like "Sulfacetamide Sodium + Sulfur" exist. Brand names include Plexion, Clenia, Prascion, and Avar, among others.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Sulfacetamide exerts its antibacterial effect by competing with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) in the folic acid synthesis pathway, essential for bacterial growth. Sulfur has keratolytic, anti-bacterial, and anti-fungal properties. The combination reduces bacterial colonization and promotes the shedding of dead skin cells, thus preventing clogged pores and reducing inflammation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Topical application minimizes systemic absorption. Some sulfacetamide may be absorbed through damaged skin, but systemic concentrations remain low.  The absorbed drug is primarily excreted in the urine. Sulfur's minimal systemic absorption is not fully understood but limited data suggest topical use does not result in significant systemic circulation.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** A thin film of Sulphacetamide + Sulphur cream, lotion, or cleanser should be applied to the affected area 1 to 3 times daily, as directed by the physician.

#### **Children:**  Use is generally recommended for children 12 years and older with similar application instructions as adults. Pediatric use in children under 12 requires careful consideration and should be under the supervision of a physician.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically necessary but consider potential for skin sensitivity.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Contraindicated in patients with kidney disease.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are generally required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use cautiously in patients with hypersensitivity to sulfonamides or sulfur. 



### **Clinical Use Cases**

The drug combination is specifically indicated for acne vulgaris, acne rosacea, and seborrheic dermatitis. It's not intended for use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are typically not needed for elderly patients or those with hepatic dysfunction. Renal impairment contraindicates the drug's use. Discontinue or reduce application frequency if excessive dryness or irritation occurs.



## **Side Effects**

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term effects are rare with topical application but may include increased skin sensitivity and potential for contact dermatitis.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

ADRs include severe skin reactions, systemic hypersensitivity reactions, and blood disorders.
