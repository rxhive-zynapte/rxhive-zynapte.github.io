      However, the FDA has banned triclosan from some over-the-counter
      antiseptic wash products due to concerns about its long-term safety and
      efficacy compared to regular soap and water. It's important to consult a
      dermatologist or healthcare professional to determine the most suitable
      cleansing product for individual needs.

## **Usage**

Sulphonated surfactant blend combined with triclosan is primarily used as a topical cleansing agent in soaps and detergents for its antibacterial and cleansing properties. It is commonly prescribed for acne treatment and managing oily skin.  It is not classified under a single pharmacological class but exhibits properties of an antiseptic, antibacterial, and detergent. The sulphonated surfactant blend acts as a detergent, aiding in the removal of dirt and oil. Triclosan's mechanism of action is primarily related to disrupting bacterial fatty acid synthesis, thereby inhibiting bacterial growth.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for this specific combination. However, each component may be referred to by various chemical names. Commercially, various brand names (e.g., Acneyer, Zero Zit Soap) market products containing this blend.



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  The sulphonated surfactant blend primarily functions as a detergent, lowering surface tension and facilitating the removal of dirt, oil, and debris. Triclosan's primary pharmacodynamic effect is antibacterial action through the inhibition of bacterial fatty acid synthesis, specifically targeting the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase enzyme (ENR).

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Primarily for topical application; systemic absorption is limited. When absorbed, triclosan is metabolized in the liver primarily through glucuronidation and sulfonation, and subsequently eliminated through urine and feces.  Limited information exists regarding the specific pharmacokinetics of sulphonated surfactant blends.

**Mode of Action:** Sulphonated surfactants work by reducing surface tension, allowing water to spread and penetrate materials, facilitating the removal of dirt and oil. Triclosan inhibits bacterial fatty acid synthesis by targeting ENR, an enzyme crucial for bacterial cell membrane synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death.

**Elimination pathways:** Triclosan, when absorbed systemically, is primarily metabolized by the liver through glucuronidation and sulfonation and eliminated primarily via urine and feces.


## **Dosage**

This drug combination is intended for topical use only.  Dosage recommendations generally involve washing the affected area with the soap once or twice daily.


### **Standard Dosage**  
#### **Adults:**  Lather the soap on the affected area and rinse thoroughly with water once or twice daily.

#### **Children:**  Use under adult supervision. Avoid contact with eyes and mouth.  Dosage is similar to adults, applying lather to affected area and rinsing thoroughly once or twice daily.


#### **Special Cases:**  No specific dosage adjustments are generally necessary for elderly patients, or those with renal or hepatic impairment when used topically. However, use with caution and under the guidance of a healthcare professional in these populations.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  

The Sulphonated Surfactant Blend + Triclosan combination is not indicated for use in intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary application is for topical cleansing of the skin.


### **Dosage Adjustments**  

No specific dosage adjustments are generally required for this combination.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**  
Mild skin irritation or dryness may occur.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**  
Allergic reactions, including rash, itching, redness, and swelling, though rare, can occur.  Seek immediate medical attention if these symptoms appear.


### **Long-Term Effects**  
The potential long-term effects of topical triclosan use are still under investigation, including the possibility of antibiotic resistance and endocrine disruption with chronic high-level exposure.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Severe allergic reactions require immediate discontinuation and medical attention.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to sulphonated surfactants or triclosan.



## **Drug Interactions**
No significant drug interactions are known when used topically.
