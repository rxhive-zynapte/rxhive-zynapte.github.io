## **Usage**

- This combination of testosterone esters is prescribed for **testosterone replacement therapy** in males with **hypogonadism** (either congenital or acquired), where testosterone deficiency has been confirmed by clinical features and biochemical tests.  It is also used as supportive therapy for **female-to-male transsexuals**. In men, it might be indicated in cases of osteoporosis caused by androgen deficiency.
- **Pharmacological Classification**: Androgen, Anabolic Steroid.
- **Mechanism of Action**: This drug acts by replacing the deficient testosterone in the body. Testosterone exerts its effects by binding to androgen receptors within various target tissues, including the reproductive system, skeletal muscle, bone, and the central nervous system. This leads to the development and maintenance of male secondary sexual characteristics, increased protein synthesis, enhanced bone density, and modulation of libido and mood.

## **Alternate Names**

- Sustanon 250, Sustanon 100 (depending on concentration)
- TP/TPP/TiC/TD (abbreviation for the four esters)
- Other brand names:  Durandrone Forte, Durateston, Prarbolan

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**:  The combination of testosterone esters acts on androgen receptors. It stimulates the development and maintenance of male secondary sexual characteristics, promotes protein anabolism (growth of tissues), enhances bone density, and influences behavior and libido.
- **Pharmacokinetics**:
    - **Absorption**: Administered intramuscularly, the esters are gradually absorbed into the bloodstream at varying rates due to their differing chain lengths.
    - **Metabolism**: The esters are hydrolyzed in the body to release testosterone, which is then metabolized primarily in the liver.
    - **Elimination**:  Testosterone metabolites are eliminated primarily through the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action**:  Binds to intracellular androgen receptors. The hormone-receptor complex translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with specific DNA sequences, modulating gene expression.
- **Elimination Pathways**:  Primarily renal excretion of metabolites. Hepatic metabolism plays a role in the breakdown and conversion of testosterone.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 1 mL intramuscular injection every 3 weeks.
- Dosage is adjusted based on the individual patient's response and testosterone levels.


#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy haven't been established in children and adolescents.
- Use with caution in pre-pubertal children due to the potential for accelerated bone maturation and premature epiphyseal closure.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**:  Dosage adjustment may be required based on individual response and monitoring.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Close monitoring is advised. Dose adjustment might be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Close monitoring is advised. Dose adjustment might be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Individualized assessment and dose adjustment may be required.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources focus primarily on testosterone replacement therapy. Dosages for situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations are not relevant to this specific medication.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be necessary based on patient response, testosterone levels, and any underlying health conditions. Regular monitoring of hormone levels is crucial to optimize therapy and minimize potential side effects.
