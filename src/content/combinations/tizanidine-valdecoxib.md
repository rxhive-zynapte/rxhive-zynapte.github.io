## **Usage**

This combination is not FDA-approved. It combines Tizanidine, a central alpha-2 adrenergic agonist and muscle relaxant, with Valdecoxib, a COX-2 selective NSAID.  It is sometimes prescribed off-label for conditions involving muscle spasms, pain, and inflammation, such as chronic neck and lumbosacral neuralgia with a myofascial component, and regional musculoskeletal pain syndromes.  Its use is not standardized and should be approached with caution. Tizanidine is primarily used to treat spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury. Valdecoxib, when available, was used for pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other conditions.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

* Tizanidine: Skeletal Muscle Relaxant, Alpha-2 adrenergic agonist
* Valdecoxib: Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID), COX-2 inhibitor

**Mechanism of Action:**

* Tizanidine: Acts centrally on alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the spinal cord, inhibiting the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, thereby reducing muscle tone and spasticity.
* Valdecoxib: Selectively inhibits cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, which is involved in prostaglandin synthesis, reducing inflammation and pain.

## **Alternate Names**

Valdecoxib/Tizanidine combination (no established brand name). Brand names containing these ingredients separately exist, but no brand name exists for the combination product.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* Tizanidine: Decreases muscle tone, alleviates muscle spasms.  May cause drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, hypotension, and fatigue.
* Valdecoxib: Reduces inflammation and pain. May increase the risk of cardiovascular events and gastrointestinal bleeding.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* Tizanidine:  Well-absorbed orally. Metabolized primarily by CYP1A2 enzyme in the liver. Excreted primarily by the kidneys.
* Valdecoxib: Well-absorbed orally. Metabolized in the liver. Primarily excreted in the urine.

**Mode of Action:**

* Tizanidine:  Binds to central alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, decreasing the release of excitatory amino acids, which reduces motor neuron activity.
* Valdecoxib:  Inhibits COX-2 enzyme, blocking prostaglandin production.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**

* Tizanidine: Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist.
* Valdecoxib: COX-2 enzyme inhibitor.

**Elimination Pathways:**

* Tizanidine: Primarily renal excretion.
* Valdecoxib: Primarily renal excretion.



## **Dosage**

Due to this combination not being an FDA-approved medication, there are no official dosage guidelines. Any dosage should be determined and closely monitored by a physician based on individual patient needs and potential drug interactions.  It is crucial to consult with specialist colleagues and thoroughly review the patient's medical history before prescribing this off-label combination.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
* Dry mouth
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Fatigue
* Hypotension
* Nausea or vomiting
* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Heartburn

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema)
* Liver damage (hepatotoxicity)
* Bleeding
* Cardiovascular events (e.g., myocardial infarction, stroke)
* Hallucinations

### **Long-Term Effects**
Long-term use of Valdecoxib carries an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Long-term use of Tizanidine might lead to tolerance and potential dependence.


## **Contraindications**
* Hypersensitivity to either Tizanidine or Valdecoxib.
* Severe liver disease.
* Concurrent use of fluvoxamine or ciprofloxacin (with Tizanidine).


## **Drug Interactions**
* Tizanidine:  Fluvoxamine, Ciprofloxacin, other alpha-2 agonists (e.g., clonidine), CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines), oral contraceptives, CYP1A2 inhibitors.
* Valdecoxib:  Warfarin, Aspirin, Lithium, ACE inhibitors, Diuretics. Concurrent use with other NSAIDs may increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of this combination during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been established. Both Tizanidine and Valdecoxib should be used with caution. Consult a healthcare professional.
