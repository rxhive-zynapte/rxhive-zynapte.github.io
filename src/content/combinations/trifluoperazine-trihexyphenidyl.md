## **Usage**

- Trifluoperazine + Trihexyphenidyl is prescribed primarily for the management of schizophrenia and its associated symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thoughts. It can also be used short-term for generalized anxiety disorder and depression.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Trifluoperazine is a typical antipsychotic (neuroleptic), while Trihexyphenidyl is an anticholinergic (antiparkinsonian agent).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Trifluoperazine primarily acts by blocking dopamine D2 receptors in the brain, reducing the excessive dopamine activity believed to cause schizophrenic symptoms.  Trihexyphenidyl is added to counteract extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), such as tremors and muscle stiffness, caused by Trifluoperazine by blocking acetylcholine's action.

## **Alternate Names**

While the combination doesn't have a specific international nonproprietary name (INN), it is recognized by its constituent drugs.
- **Brand names:**  Eridyl-Forte, Trazine H, Triexdil-2 T, Stelazine (Trifluoperazine), Artane, Trihex (trihexyphenidyl)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Trifluoperazine exerts its antipsychotic effects by antagonizing dopamine D2 receptors. Trihexyphenidyl, an anticholinergic, reduces EPS by inhibiting acetylcholine's effects on muscarinic receptors, particularly in the central nervous system, thereby relieving drug-induced parkinsonism.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Trifluoperazine is well-absorbed orally, extensively metabolized by the liver (primarily via CYP450 enzymes), and excreted through urine and feces. Trihexyphenidyl is also well-absorbed orally, with hepatic metabolism and primarily renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** Trifluoperazine primarily affects dopamine neurotransmission. Trihexyphenidyl acts by competitively inhibiting the actions of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, predominantly in the central nervous system (CNS), thereby restoring the cholinergic-dopaminergic neurotransmitter imbalance in extrapyramidal areas of the brain.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Trifluoperazine is eliminated mainly by hepatic metabolism (CYP450), with renal and fecal excretion. Trihexyphenidyl undergoes hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- Schizophrenia: Initially, 2.5 mg of Trifluoperazine with 1 mg of Trihexyphenidyl once or twice a day. This can be adjusted as needed up to 5 mg Trifluoperazine + 2 mg Trihexyphenidyl, once or twice a day. The maximum daily dose of Trifluoperazine should generally not exceed 40 mg.
- Anxiety/Depression: Start with 1-2 mg of Trifluoperazine per day, not to exceed 6 mg/day. Trihexyphenidyl dosage is determined individually based on the severity of EPS.

#### **Children:**
- Not recommended for children under 6 years old for Trifluoperazine.
- Trifluoperazine dosage for older children needs careful consideration by a pediatrician, starting with 1 mg/day and gradually increasing if needed, not exceeding 15 mg/day.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** Start at a lower dose and titrate cautiously due to increased sensitivity and potential for adverse reactions.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Use with caution and monitor closely. Dose adjustments might be needed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Trifluoperazine is contraindicated in severe liver disease. Use with caution in mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Trihexyphenidyl dose may need to be adjusted.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular diseases, glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, and other medical conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**
- The Trifluoperazine + Trihexyphenidyl combination is not typically used in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. These scenarios might require different medications.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
- Dosage should be adjusted based on patient response, tolerability, and renal/hepatic function.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
- Dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention, nausea, weight gain, and orthostatic hypotension.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), tardive dyskinesia, agranulocytosis, seizures, jaundice, severe allergic reactions, and prolonged QT interval.

### **Long-Term Effects**
- Tardive dyskinesia (potentially irreversible involuntary movements) can develop with prolonged use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
- NMS, agranulocytosis, and severe allergic reactions.


## **Contraindications**
- Hypersensitivity to either drug, severe CNS depression, coma, narrow-angle glaucoma, bowel obstruction, severe liver or kidney disease,  bone marrow depression.

## **Drug Interactions**
- CNS depressants (alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines), anticholinergics (atropine, scopolamine), antihypertensives (guanethidine), antiparkinsonian drugs (levodopa), anticoagulants (warfarin), QT prolonging drugs, certain antibiotics and antifungals.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Trifluoperazine is generally not recommended during pregnancy, especially the third trimester, due to potential risks to the fetus. 
- **Breastfeeding:**  Trifluoperazine passes into breast milk and can have potential effects on the infant. Use with caution and monitor for any adverse effects in the neonate.  Safer alternatives may be considered.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Trifluoperazine blocks dopamine receptors; Trihexyphenidyl counteracts antipsychotic-induced EPS by blocking acetylcholine.
- **Side Effects:** Dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention, NMS, tardive dyskinesia.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, coma, narrow-angle glaucoma, severe liver/kidney disease.
- **Drug Interactions:** CNS depressants, anticholinergics, antihypertensives, QT prolonging agents.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution, potential risks to the fetus and infant.
- **Dosage:**  Adults: starting 2.5mg + 1mg once/twice daily. Pediatrics: not recommended under 6. Adjust based on condition and tolerability.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Mental status, EPS, weight, blood pressure, liver and kidney function tests.

## **Popular Combinations**
- This combination itself is used to address both the psychotic symptoms and EPS associated with Trifluoperazine.

## **Precautions**
- Monitor for NMS, tardive dyskinesia, and other serious side effects.
- **Specific Populations:** Cautious use in pregnant/breastfeeding women, children, elderly, patients with renal/hepatic impairment.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid alcohol, driving or operating machinery until effects are known.
