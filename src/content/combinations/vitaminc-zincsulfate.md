## **Usage**

Vitamin C + Zinc Sulfate is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to prevent or treat deficiencies of Vitamin C and Zinc. It is also used to support immune function, promote wound healing, and improve overall health.  It may be prescribed for individuals with weakened immune systems, those recovering from illness or surgery, and those with poor dietary intake of these nutrients.  

- **Pharmacological classification**: Nutritional supplement, vitamin, mineral

- **Mechanism of action**: Vitamin C acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage and supporting various enzymatic reactions. Zinc is essential for immune function, cell growth and repair, wound healing, and numerous other bodily processes. The combination works synergistically to enhance these effects.

## **Alternate Names**

Ascorbic Acid + Zinc Sulfate

No widely recognized international variations exist. Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region.  Some examples might include (but are not limited to) ImmunPro, CONTINGEN-Z and similar combination products.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Vitamin C is an antioxidant, scavenging free radicals and protecting cellular structures from oxidative damage. It also plays a role in collagen synthesis, immune function, and iron absorption. Zinc is a cofactor for numerous enzymes involved in cell growth, protein synthesis, immune function, wound healing, and other vital processes. It also contributes to the structural integrity of proteins and cell membranes.

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Vitamin C is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, reaching peak plasma concentrations within a few hours. Excess Vitamin C is excreted in the urine. Zinc absorption is influenced by dietary factors and can be reduced by phytates found in certain foods. It is primarily stored in muscle and bone tissue. Zinc is excreted primarily through the feces.

- **Mode of action:** Vitamin C donates electrons to neutralize free radicals, protecting cellular components from oxidative stress. Zinc binds to and modulates the activity of various enzymes and proteins involved in diverse physiological functions.

- **Elimination pathways:** Vitamin C is eliminated through renal excretion. Zinc is eliminated through both fecal and urinary excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**  

#### **Adults:**
One tablet containing 500mg Vitamin C and 10-20 mg elemental zinc daily, or as directed by a physician. For the U.S the recommended dietary allowance of zinc is 11 mg/day for adult males and 8 mg/day for adult females.  Dosages may vary depending upon the specific indication and product formulation.

#### **Children:**

Dosing should be based on age and weight. Consult pediatric dosing guidelines for specific age groups. Drops may be available for infants. 20 mg per day for children has been suggested, with potentially lower doses to reduce vomiting.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: No specific adjustments are typically required, but consider renal function and overall health status.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment**:  Use with caution due to the potential risk of kidney stone formation. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**:  Use with caution. Dosage modifications may be necessary due to impaired metabolism.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Consider specific conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other relevant comorbidities when determining appropriate dosing. 

### **Clinical Use Cases**  

Dosing for specific clinical situations should be determined by the treating physician based on the patient's individual needs.  In cases of deficiency, higher doses may be required and are determined by the prescriber based on severity.  In the case of a cold, 3 to 4 capsules daily are sometimes taken.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be required based on renal function, hepatic function, and the presence of other medical conditions.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy**:  Consult with a healthcare professional. While adequate intake of Vitamin C and Zinc is important during pregnancy, supplementation should not exceed recommended daily allowances (RDAs). For pregnant females 18 years of age the RDA for Zinc is 13 mg per day and is 11 mg/day for females 19 and over. The RDA for Vitamin C is 80 mg/day for ages 14-18 and 85 mg/day for ages 19 and over.  Excessive intake may pose risks to the fetus.

- **Breastfeeding**: Consult with a healthcare professional.  Zinc is excreted in breast milk. The RDA for breastfeeding is 17 mg/day for Zinc and 120 mg/day for Vitamin C for those 18 years of age, 12 mg/day for Zinc and 120 mg/day for Vitamin C for 19 and over. Supplementation should not exceed RDAs without medical guidance.
