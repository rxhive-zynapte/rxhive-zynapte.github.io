## **Usage**

- 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) is primarily used as an imaging agent in its radiolabeled form ([18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose or FDG) for positron emission tomography (PET) scans. FDG-PET is used to measure glucose metabolism, which is altered in various conditions, including cancer and some infections.  It has also been investigated as an adjunct therapy in COVID-19.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antimetabolite, glucose analog.
- **Mechanism of Action:** 2-DG acts as a glucose analog and competes with glucose for uptake into cells. However, unlike glucose, 2-DG cannot be fully metabolized. This leads to disruption of glycolysis, inhibiting energy production and other cellular processes dependent on glucose metabolism.

## **Alternate Names**

- 2-DG
- [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) (radiolabeled form)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** 2-DG inhibits glycolysis, leading to reduced cellular energy production and impacting other glucose-dependent processes. In cancer cells, this can lead to decreased proliferation and potentially cell death.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 2-DG is administered orally and is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It distributes to various tissues, mimicking glucose uptake. It is partially metabolized, but unlike glucose, it cannot undergo complete glycolysis. Elimination pathways are not fully characterized, but some excretion occurs via the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:**  2-DG competitively inhibits glucose uptake and phosphorylation by hexokinase, the first enzyme in glycolysis. This blocks further glucose metabolism and disrupts cellular energy production.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Primarily involves competitive inhibition of hexokinase.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

2-DG is not FDA-approved for therapeutic use in the United States. Dosage information below is based on clinical trials and emergency use authorization in certain contexts.

#### **Adults:** Dosages have varied in clinical trials.  Dosages of 45 mg/kg, 63 mg/kg, and up to 126 mg/kg/day have been studied.

#### **Children:**  No established pediatric dosing guidelines are currently available.

#### **Special Cases:** Limited information is available regarding dosing adjustments in special populations.  Clinical studies are needed to determine appropriate dosing in elderly patients, those with renal or hepatic impairment, and those with comorbid conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Currently, clinical use cases are primarily limited to research settings. Clinical trials have investigated 2-DG as an adjunct therapy in cancer and COVID-19. Emergency use authorization has been granted in some countries for COVID-19.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient tolerance and any emerging adverse effects.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Fatigue, dizziness, nausea, sweating, and hyperglycemia.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

QTc prolongation, gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiac conduction abnormalities (e.g., AV block, bradycardia).

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term effects are not well-established due to limited long-term clinical use of 2-DG.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs include QTc prolongation, cardiac conduction abnormalities, and gastrointestinal bleeding. These require close monitoring and potential intervention.


## **Contraindications**

Currently, specific contraindications are not well-defined due to the drug's limited clinical use. However, patients with pre-existing cardiac conduction abnormalities should be carefully monitored.


## **Drug Interactions**

Drug interactions are not fully characterized.  Clinical trials have indicated no significant interaction between 2-DG and docetaxel.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of 2-DG during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been established.  It should be avoided unless the potential benefit outweighs the unknown risk to the fetus or neonate.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Glucose analog, inhibits glycolysis.
- **Side Effects:** Fatigue, dizziness, nausea, hyperglycemia; QTc prolongation, gastrointestinal bleeding.
- **Contraindications:**  Limited data available. Caution in patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities.
- **Drug Interactions:** Not fully characterized.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Avoid unless potential benefit outweighs risk.
- **Dosage:** Varies based on clinical trial; 45-126 mg/kg/day has been studied.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  ECG (for QTc prolongation), blood glucose, cardiac function.


## **Popular Combinations**

Combinations of 2-DG with other cancer therapies are under investigation.


## **Precautions**

General precautions include monitoring for cardiac and metabolic effects.  Precautions for specific populations are not well-defined due to limited data.
