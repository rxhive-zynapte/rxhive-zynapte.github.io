## **Usage**

- Abatacept is prescribed for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who have had an insufficient response or intolerance to other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including methotrexate (MTX) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocking agents.  It is also indicated for moderate to severe active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older who have had an inadequate response to previous DMARD therapy, and for active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adults.  Additionally, it is used for the prophylaxis of acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate, in adults undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a matched or 1 allele-mismatched unrelated donor.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Selective costimulation modulator, Immunomodulator, Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), Biologic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Abatacept inhibits T-cell activation by selectively binding to CD80 and CD86 on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), blocking the interaction with CD28 on T-cells. This interaction is a necessary costimulatory signal for full T-cell activation. By disrupting this signal, abatacept reduces the inflammatory response associated with RA, pJIA, and PsA.


## **Alternate Names** 
- International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Abatacept
- **Brand Names:** Orencia, Orencia ClickJect


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Abatacept modulates the immune response by inhibiting T-cell activation, reducing inflammation, and slowing the progression of joint damage.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Abatacept exhibits dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. The subcutaneous (SC) route has a bioavailability of approximately 78%. Steady state is reached in 3 months for both routes.
- **Mode of Action:** Abatacept binds to CD80 and CD86 on antigen-presenting cells, preventing the binding of CD28 on T-cells, which is required for their activation.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Binds to CD80/86 receptors, leading to inhibition of T-cell activation.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Abatacept undergoes elimination via catabolism; it is not specifically cleared by renal or hepatic pathways, and not metabolized by CYP enzymes.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (RA and PsA):**

- **IV:** Weight-based dosing: <60 kg: 500 mg; 60-100 kg: 750 mg; >100 kg: 1000 mg, infused over 30 minutes. Initial dose followed by doses at 2 and 4 weeks after the first infusion, and then every 4 weeks thereafter.
- **SC:** 125 mg subcutaneously once weekly, with or without an IV loading dose (same weight-based dosing as IV). If using an IV loading dose, the first SC dose should be administered within one day of the IV infusion.

#### **Children (pJIA, ≥2 years):**

- **IV (≥6 years):**  Weight-based dosing: <75 kg: 10 mg/kg;  ≥75 kg: Adult dose (not to exceed 1000 mg), infused over 30 minutes.  Initial dose followed by doses at 2 and 4 weeks after the first infusion, and then every 4 weeks thereafter. 
- **SC (≥2 years):** Weight-based dosing: 10 kg to <25 kg: 50 mg; 25 kg to <50 kg: 87.5 mg; ≥50 kg: 125 mg, subcutaneously once weekly.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose recommendations, as abatacept has not been studied in this population.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose recommendations, as abatacept has not been studied in this population.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Close monitoring and caution advised, especially with conditions predisposing to infections (e.g., diabetes, COPD).

### **Clinical Use Cases**  
Abatacept is not indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  It is used for chronic management of RA, pJIA, PsA, and prevention of aGvHD in HSCT.

### **Dosage Adjustments**  
Dose adjustments may be necessary for patients transitioning from IV to SC administration.  The first SC dose should be administered instead of the next scheduled IV dose. No specific dose adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, however, caution should be used due to increased risk of infections.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), headache, nausea.  Injection site reactions (with SC administration).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Serious infections (e.g., pneumonia, sepsis), malignancy, hypersensitivity reactions (including angioedema and anaphylaxis).

### **Long-Term Effects:**
Potential increased risk of infections with prolonged use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
Anaphylaxis, angioedema.



## **Contraindications**
- Severe and uncontrolled infections (sepsis, opportunistic infections).
- Hypersensitivity to abatacept or any component of the formulation.

## **Drug Interactions**

- **Clinically Significant Drug Interactions:** Concomitant use with TNF inhibitors is not recommended due to increased risk of serious infections.  Avoid concomitant use of other biologic DMARDs.  Live vaccines should not be given concurrently or within 3 months of discontinuation. Consult drug interaction resources for a comprehensive list of potential interactions.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  C (Australia);  Not assigned (US FDA).  
- **Fetal Risks:** Insufficient data available on use in pregnant women to inform drug-related risk. Abatacept may cross the placenta, potentially increasing the risk of infection in infants exposed in utero. Live vaccines are not recommended for these infants for 14 weeks following the mother's last exposure.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Limited information available.  Abatacept is present in rat milk. Potential for serious side effects in the breastfed child. Breastfeeding is generally not recommended during treatment and for up to 14 weeks after the last dose.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits T-cell activation by binding to CD80/86.
- **Side Effects:** URTIs, headache, nausea, injection site reactions, serious infections, malignancy, hypersensitivity reactions.
- **Contraindications:**  Severe infections, hypersensitivity to abatacept.
- **Drug Interactions:** TNF inhibitors, other biologic DMARDs, live vaccines.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use only if clearly needed during pregnancy.  Breastfeeding not recommended.
- **Dosage:** See detailed dosage guidelines above.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for signs of infection, malignancy, hypersensitivity reactions.  Periodically assess disease activity and adjust therapy as needed.


## **Popular Combinations**
Abatacept is often used in combination with methotrexate (MTX) in patients with RA and pJIA.  However, combining abatacept with other biologic DMARDs, especially TNF inhibitors, is not recommended due to increased infection risk.

## **Precautions**
- Screen for TB, hepatitis B and C before initiating therapy.
- Monitor for signs of infection throughout treatment.
- Avoid live vaccines during treatment and for 3 months after discontinuation.
- Caution in patients with COPD, as it may worsen respiratory symptoms.
- Increased risk of perioperative infections; consider withholding abatacept prior to surgery.
