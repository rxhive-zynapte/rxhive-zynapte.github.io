## **Usage**

- Abciximab is prescribed as an adjunct to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the prevention of cardiac ischemic complications in patients undergoing PCI. It is also used for unstable angina not responding to conventional medical therapy when PCI is planned within 24 hours.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor, Antiplatelet agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Abciximab binds to the glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor on the surface of platelets, preventing the binding of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and other adhesive molecules. This inhibition of the GP IIb/IIIa receptor blocks the final common pathway of platelet aggregation, thereby reducing the risk of thrombus formation.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Abciximab
- **Brand Name:** ReoPro

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Abciximab produces dose-dependent inhibition of platelet function.  A single intravenous bolus dose of 0.25-0.30 mg/kg results in approximately 80% blockade of platelet GP IIb/IIIa receptors and nearly complete inhibition of platelet aggregation within two hours. Platelet function generally recovers within 48 hours, although abciximab can remain in circulation bound to platelets for up to 15 days.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Administered intravenously. After a 0.25 mg/kg bolus and a continuous infusion of 10 µg/min, relatively constant free plasma concentrations are achieved.  Free plasma abciximab concentrations fall rapidly for approximately six hours after the infusion is stopped and then decline more slowly.
- **Mode of Action:** Abciximab is a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist.  It binds to the receptor on activated platelets, preventing fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor from binding, thus inhibiting platelet aggregation. It also binds to the vitronectin receptor and the Mac-1 receptor.
- **Receptor Binding:**  Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor, vitronectin (αvβ3) receptor, Mac-1 receptor.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **PCI:** 0.25 mg/kg intravenous bolus 10-60 minutes before PCI, followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of 0.125 µg/kg/min (maximum 10 µg/min) for 12 hours.
- **Unstable Angina (with planned PCI within 24 hours):** 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 10 µg/min for 18-24 hours, concluding one hour after PCI.

#### **Children:**

- Use and dose must be determined by a doctor.  Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are typically required, but careful monitoring for bleeding is essential.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Severe renal impairment requiring hemodialysis is a contraindication. Dose adjustments may be needed in other cases of renal impairment, though specific recommendations are not consistently provided.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Severe hepatic impairment is a contraindication.  Dose adjustments may be needed in other cases of hepatic dysfunction, though specific recommendations are not consistently provided.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Close monitoring for bleeding is particularly important in patients with comorbidities that increase bleeding risk.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Abciximab's clinical use is primarily focused on PCI and unstable angina when PCI is imminent.  It is not indicated for routine use in intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, general ICU use, or specific emergency situations like cardiac arrest.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, though specific recommendations are not consistently provided.  Close monitoring of these patients is essential.
