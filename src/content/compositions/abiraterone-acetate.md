## **Usage**

Abiraterone acetate is prescribed for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and metastatic high-risk castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC).  It is classified as an antineoplastic agent, specifically a CYP17 inhibitor.  It works by inhibiting the enzyme CYP17, which is involved in the production of androgens (male hormones like testosterone) in the testes, adrenal glands, and tumor tissue. By blocking this enzyme, abiraterone acetate reduces androgen levels, thereby slowing the growth of prostate cancer cells that rely on these hormones.

## **Alternate Names**

The international nonproprietary name (INN) is abiraterone acetate.  Brand names include Zytiga® and Yonsa®.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Abiraterone acetate is a prodrug that is rapidly converted to its active metabolite, abiraterone. Abiraterone inhibits CYP17, a key enzyme in androgen biosynthesis. This inhibition occurs in the testes, adrenal glands, and even within the tumor itself.  Consequently, it reduces the production of testosterone and other androgens, leading to decreased levels of these hormones in the body.  This deprivation of androgens suppresses the growth of prostate cancer.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Abiraterone acetate is administered orally and absorption is significantly increased when taken with food.  Therefore, it's crucial to administer the medication on an empty stomach (no food for at least two hours before and one hour after intake).
* **Metabolism:** It is rapidly hydrolyzed by esterases to its active metabolite, abiraterone. Abiraterone is further metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 to inactive metabolites (abiraterone sulfate and N-oxide abiraterone sulfate).
* **Elimination:**  Primarily eliminated via hepatic (liver) routes through feces and to a lesser extent via renal (kidney) excretion through urine.


**Mode of Action:**  Abiraterone specifically targets and inhibits the CYP17 enzyme complex (17α-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase), effectively blocking the production of androgens at three different levels: in the testes, adrenal glands, and the prostate tumor itself.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition:** Abiraterone acts through enzyme inhibition, specifically targeting CYP17. It does not directly bind to androgen receptors.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic, with a smaller fraction via renal excretion.  CYP3A4 plays a major role in abiraterone metabolism.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **mCRPC:** 1000 mg (four 250 mg tablets or two 500 mg tablets) once daily, taken orally on an empty stomach with prednisone 5 mg twice daily.
* **mCSPC:** 1000 mg (four 250 mg tablets or two 500 mg tablets) once daily, taken orally on an empty stomach with prednisone 5 mg once daily.  
* **Micronized Abiraterone Acetate (Yonsa®):** 500 mg (four 125 mg tablets) once daily, taken orally with methylprednisolone 4 mg twice daily.

#### **Children:** Use is not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dose adjustment is routinely recommended, although close monitoring is advised.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
    * **Mild Impairment (Child-Pugh A):** No dose adjustment is necessary.
    * **Moderate Impairment (Child-Pugh B):** Starting dose reduced to 250 mg once daily. Close monitoring of liver function tests is crucial.
    * **Severe Impairment (Child-Pugh C):** Abiraterone acetate is contraindicated.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, adrenal or pituitary gland disorders, or those at risk for hypokalemia.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Abiraterone acetate is not indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations such as status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.  Its use is specifically confined to the treatment of mCRPC and mCSPC as an anticancer agent in conjunction with prednisone or methylprednisolone.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient tolerability, the co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers (increase abiraterone dose frequency during co-administration), or the development of hepatotoxicity during treatment (interrupt treatment until recovery and consider reducing dose upon re-initiation).

## **Drug Interactions**

* **CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. John's wort):** Reduce abiraterone exposure. Avoid co-administration or adjust abiraterone dosage.
* **CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole):**  No clinically significant effect.
* **CYP2D6 substrates (e.g., dextromethorphan, thioridazine):** Abiraterone can increase their levels.  Avoid co-administration or adjust the dosage of the CYP2D6 substrate.
* **CYP2C8 substrates (e.g., pioglitazone, repaglinide):**  Abiraterone can increase their levels. Monitor for toxicity and consider dose adjustment, especially for those with a narrow therapeutic index.
* **Radium Ra 223:** Concomitant use increases the risk of fractures and death.
* **Spironolactone:**  May increase PSA levels; co-administration is not recommended.
* **Oral anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin):**  Close monitoring is recommended due to potential interaction, though specific dose adjustment guidelines are not established.
