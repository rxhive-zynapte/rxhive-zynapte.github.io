## **Usage**

Acalabrutinib is prescribed for the treatment of certain types of blood cancers in adults. These include:

* **Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL):**  Prescribed for adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy.
* **Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)**
* **Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)**

**Pharmacological Classification:** Kinase inhibitor, specifically a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor.

**Mechanism of Action:** Acalabrutinib irreversibly binds to BTK, a key enzyme in B-cell receptor signaling pathways. Inhibiting BTK disrupts the proliferation and survival of malignant B cells, which are involved in these types of cancer.


## **Alternate Names**

Acalabrutinib is the generic name. Brand names include Calquence.



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Acalabrutinib primarily targets malignant B cells by irreversibly inhibiting BTK, thereby disrupting downstream signaling crucial for B-cell survival and proliferation. This leads to reduced growth and eventual apoptosis of cancerous B cells.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Acalabrutinib is well-absorbed orally, with or without food. However, acidic beverages (like grapefruit or orange juice) can decrease the absorption of the capsule formulation.  Tablet formulation does not have this food interaction.
* **Metabolism:**  Primarily metabolized in the liver, mainly by CYP3A4. A major active metabolite, ACP-5862, also contributes to the drug's activity.
* **Elimination:** Excreted primarily through feces, with a smaller portion excreted in urine.


**Mode of Action:**  Acalabrutinib forms a covalent bond with a cysteine residue in the BTK active site, leading to irreversible inhibition of its kinase activity. This blocks B-cell receptor signaling, inhibiting B-cell activation, proliferation, and survival, ultimately promoting apoptosis of malignant B cells.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Irreversible covalent inhibition of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK).

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4, followed by fecal excretion; minor renal excretion.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 100 mg orally twice daily (approximately every 12 hours), until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Swallow tablets whole with water. Do not chew, crush, or split tablets. The capsule formulation must not be opened or chewed.


#### **Children:** The safety and efficacy of acalabrutinib in children have not been established.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No dose adjustment is required based solely on age. However, close monitoring is advised, as elderly patients may be more susceptible to adverse effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Limited data are available for patients with severe renal impairment; administer with caution and monitor closely for toxicity.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is necessary for mild or moderate hepatic impairment. However, acalabrutinib should be avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring is recommended for patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, history of infections, or bleeding disorders.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Acalabrutinib's use is primarily focused on treating CLL, SLL, and MCL.  Dosages in these settings follow the standard adult recommendations. There are no specific dosage recommendations for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are primarily based on adverse reactions, not specific clinical situations. See the section on "Side Effects" for information on dose modifications based on toxicity.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Headache, diarrhea, fatigue, muscle pain, bruising, bleeding (e.g., nosebleeds, bleeding gums), infections (e.g., upper respiratory tract infections, pneumonia).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe bleeding events (including intracranial hemorrhage and gastrointestinal bleeding), serious infections (including opportunistic infections), second primary malignancies (including skin cancer), atrial fibrillation and flutter, cytopenias (low blood cell counts).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

The potential long-term effects of acalabrutinib are still being studied. Second primary malignancies and chronic cytopenias are potential concerns.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Serious bleeding events, severe infections, atrial fibrillation and flutter,  and second primary malignancies are ADRs requiring urgent medical attention.



## **Contraindications**

Known hypersensitivity to acalabrutinib or any component of the formulation.



## **Drug Interactions**

Acalabrutinib is metabolized by CYP3A4 and can interact with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir) and inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, St. John's wort).  Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should generally be avoided, or the acalabrutinib dose may need to be reduced.  Strong CYP3A4 inducers may necessitate an increased dose of acalabrutinib. Acalabrutinib capsules also have reduced absorption when taken with acidic beverages or antacids/acid reducing agents.

Acalabrutinib may also interact with:


* **Anticoagulants/Antiplatelets:**  Increased risk of bleeding.
* **Grapefruit juice:**  Increased acalabrutinib levels and risk of side effects.
* **Other medications metabolized by CYP3A4:** Potential for altered drug levels of either acalabrutinib or the interacting drug.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Acalabrutinib may cause fetal harm and dystocia based on animal studies.  There are no adequate data in pregnant women. Acalabrutinib should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.  Effective contraception should be used during treatment and for at least 1 week after the final dose.

It is unknown whether acalabrutinib is excreted in human milk.  Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose.
