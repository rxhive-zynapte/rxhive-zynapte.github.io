  - q: >-
      Can Acarbose cause hypoglycemia?**

      **A:** Acarbose itself does not usually cause hypoglycemia when used as
      monotherapy. However, when combined with other antidiabetic agents like
      insulin or sulfonylureas, the risk of hypoglycemia increases.

      What should I advise my patient about taking Acarbose?**

      **A:**  Take acarbose with the first bite of each main meal. Adhere to the

      side effects or signs of liver problems. Do not use sucrose to treat
      hypoglycemia if it occurs; use glucose instead.

  - q: >-
      How should hypoglycemia be managed in patients taking Acarbose?**

      **A:**  Because acarbose slows sucrose digestion, use glucose (dextrose)
      tablets, gel, or other readily absorbable forms of glucose, not sucrose,
      to treat hypoglycemia.

      **A:**  Yes, acarbose can interact with several medications, including

      that increase blood glucose. Be sure to review your patient’s medication
      list for potential interactions.

## **Usage**

- Acarbose is prescribed for type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is used as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in patients whose diabetes is not adequately managed by diet and exercise alone. It may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antidiabetic medications such as sulfonylureas, metformin, or insulin.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, antidiabetic agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Acarbose competitively and reversibly inhibits alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the brush border of the small intestine. These enzymes are responsible for breaking down complex carbohydrates (starch and sucrose) into monosaccharides (glucose and fructose) which can then be absorbed. By inhibiting these enzymes, acarbose slows the rate of carbohydrate digestion and absorption, thus reducing the postprandial rise in blood glucose.

## **Alternate Names**

- International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Acarbose
- **Brand Names:** Precose, Glucobay, Prandase, Ascar, Glicobase.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Acarbose reduces postprandial hyperglycemia by delaying the absorption of glucose. This leads to a lower peak blood glucose level and a flatter glucose curve after meals.  It does not stimulate insulin secretion and therefore does not cause hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - **Absorption:**  Minimally absorbed (1-2%).  The absorbed fraction is metabolized by intestinal bacteria. The majority of the drug is excreted in feces.
    - **Metabolism:** Metabolized by intestinal flora.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily fecal excretion; small amounts are excreted in urine as metabolites.
- **Mode of Action:**  Acarbose binds to the alpha-glucosidase enzymes at the brush border of the small intestines, preventing the hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates into absorbable monosaccharides like glucose.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Acarbose acts through competitive and reversible inhibition of alpha-glucosidase, primarily the sucrase and maltase enzymes. It does not bind to receptors or modulate neurotransmitters.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily through fecal excretion of the unabsorbed drug; a small amount is metabolized by gut bacteria and excreted in urine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial: 25 mg three times daily taken orally with the first bite of each main meal.
- Maintenance:  May be increased to 50 mg three times daily, and then, if needed and tolerated, up to a maximum of 100 mg three times daily. Dosage should be adjusted at 4-8 week intervals based on postprandial glucose or HbA1c levels and tolerance.
- Maximum dose: 100 mg TID for patients >60 kg. 50 mg TID for patients ≤60 kg.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age, as safety and efficacy have not been established.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is generally needed, but closer monitoring for adverse effects is advised.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Use with caution in patients with creatinine clearance <25 mL/min/1.73 m². Dose adjustments may be required based on renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment necessary for mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with intestinal conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, colonic ulceration, or intestinal obstruction.  Closely monitor patients with these conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Acarbose is not indicated for use in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It's primarily for chronic management of type 2 diabetes.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose titration based on 1-hour postprandial glucose or HbA1c. Start with a lower dose and titrate gradually at 4- to 8-week intervals based on glycemic control and gastrointestinal tolerance.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Flatulence
- Abdominal pain
- Diarrhea
- Bloating



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Chronic gastrointestinal issues may develop with prolonged use. Regular monitoring of liver function tests is advisable.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

-  Serious allergic reactions: angioedema, anaphylaxis, erythema, urticaria.

## **Drug Interactions**

- **Digestive enzymes:** Reduced acarbose efficacy.
- **Insulin or sulfonylureas:** Increased risk of hypoglycemia.
- **Intestinal adsorbents (e.g., charcoal):**  Decreased acarbose absorption.
- **Drugs that increase blood glucose (e.g., corticosteroids, thiazide diuretics, estrogens, isoniazid, phenytoin, nicotinic acid):** May decrease acarbose efficacy.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Category B (animal studies have not demonstrated fetal risk, but there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women). Acarbose is generally not recommended during pregnancy.
- **Breastfeeding:** Acarbose is excreted in rat milk. It is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. Due to the potential for adverse effects in the nursing infant, acarbose is not recommended during breastfeeding.
