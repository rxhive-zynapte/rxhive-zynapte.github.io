## **Usage**

- Aceclofenac is prescribed for the relief of pain and inflammation in osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. It is also used for other painful conditions such as dental pain, low back pain, and periarthritis.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Aceclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, primarily COX-2, which are responsible for the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins mediate inflammation, pain, and fever. By inhibiting COX enzymes, aceclofenac reduces prostaglandin synthesis, thus alleviating these symptoms.

## **Alternate Names**

- International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Aceclofenac
- No significant regional variations in the name exist.
- **Brand Names:** Dolowin, Zerodol, Valk, Aclonac, etc. (Brand names can vary by region).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Aceclofenac exerts its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects through the inhibition of COX enzymes, predominantly COX-2. This leads to reduced prostaglandin synthesis.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - **Absorption:**  Aceclofenac is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. Food intake can slightly delay the absorption rate but does not affect the extent of absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Aceclofenac undergoes hepatic metabolism, primarily via CYP2C9 enzymes. The main metabolite is 4'-hydroxyaceclofenac.
    - **Elimination:** Aceclofenac is eliminated primarily through urine, with a small portion excreted in bile.
- **Mode of Action:** Aceclofenac binds to COX enzymes, particularly COX-2, and prevents the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2, a precursor for various pro-inflammatory prostaglandins.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Aceclofenac primarily acts through COX-2 enzyme inhibition.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Aceclofenac is mainly eliminated through renal excretion (urine), with minor biliary excretion. Metabolism occurs in the liver via CYP2C9 enzymes.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 100 mg twice daily, one tablet in the morning and one in the evening.
- The maximum recommended dose is 200 mg/day.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to lack of clinical data.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lowest effective dose and monitor closely for adverse reactions. Dose adjustments might be needed based on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution should be exercised in patients with mild renal impairment. Aceclofenac is contraindicated in severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Reduce the initial dose to 100 mg daily in mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Aceclofenac is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution should be exercised in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or diabetes. Monitor these patients closely.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Aceclofenac is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.  It's primarily used for chronic pain management in outpatient settings.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments might be needed in elderly patients, those with renal or hepatic impairment, and those with certain comorbid conditions.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Gastrointestinal discomfort (dyspepsia, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, flatulence)
- Headache, dizziness, drowsiness
- Skin rash, itching

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
- Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema)
- Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis
- Hepatic or renal dysfunction
- Cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke)

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Chronic use can potentially lead to gastrointestinal issues (ulcers, bleeding), renal damage, and cardiovascular complications.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe allergic reactions, gastrointestinal bleeding, and acute renal failure require immediate medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to aceclofenac or any other NSAIDs
- Active peptic ulcer or history of recurrent peptic ulcer/hemorrhage
- Severe heart failure, hepatic failure, or renal failure
- History of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation related to previous NSAID therapy
- Active bleeding or bleeding disorders
- Third trimester of pregnancy
- Patients undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery

## **Drug Interactions**

- Other NSAIDs: Increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects
- Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin): Increased risk of bleeding
- Antihypertensives and diuretics: Reduced effectiveness of these drugs
- Corticosteroids: Increased risk of gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding
- Methotrexate: Increased methotrexate levels and toxicity
- Lithium and digoxin: Increased levels of these drugs
- Oral antidiabetic agents: Enhanced hypoglycemic effect
- Alcohol: Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Contraindicated in the third trimester. Use with caution in the first and second trimesters only if clearly necessary and at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.
- **Fetal Risks:** Potential for miscarriage, cardiac malformation, and gastroschisis in early pregnancy. Premature closure of ductus arteriosus and pulmonary hypertension in the third trimester.
- **Breastfeeding:** Aceclofenac is not recommended during breastfeeding as it may pass into breast milk.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** COX inhibitor, predominantly COX-2.
- **Side Effects:** GI discomfort, headache, dizziness, skin rash; rarely, GI bleeding, allergic reactions, renal/hepatic dysfunction.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, peptic ulcer, severe heart/liver/kidney failure, GI bleeding history, pregnancy (3rd trimester).
- **Drug Interactions:** Other NSAIDs, anticoagulants, antihypertensives, corticosteroids, methotrexate, lithium, digoxin.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in 3rd trimester, caution in 1st and 2nd trimesters; not recommended while breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** 100 mg twice daily (max 200 mg/day); adjustments needed for elderly, renal/hepatic impairment.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Renal and liver function, blood pressure, signs of GI bleeding.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Aceclofenac is sometimes combined with paracetamol (as in Zerodol-SP) or with serratiopeptidase for enhanced pain relief.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess for allergies, renal/hepatic function, and cardiovascular risk factors.
- **Specific Populations:** Monitor elderly patients and those with renal or hepatic impairment closely. Avoid use in the third trimester of pregnancy and use with caution in the first and second trimesters only if clearly necessary. Not recommended during breastfeeding.  Not recommended for use in children under 18 years.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Limit alcohol intake to minimize GI risks.
