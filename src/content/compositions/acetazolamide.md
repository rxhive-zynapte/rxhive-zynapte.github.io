## **Usage**

Acetazolamide is prescribed for several medical conditions, including:

*   **Glaucoma:** Reduces intraocular pressure.
*   **Edema:**  Treats fluid retention (especially in congestive heart failure).
*   **Epilepsy:** Adjunctive therapy for certain types of seizures.
*   **Altitude Sickness:** Prevents and treats symptoms.
*   **Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri):** Lowers intracranial pressure.
*   **Periodic Paralysis:** Prevents attacks.
*   **Central Sleep Apnea:** Reduces episodes.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, diuretic.

**Mechanism of Action:** Acetazolamide inhibits the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which is involved in the formation of bicarbonate ions. This inhibition leads to decreased bicarbonate reabsorption in the kidneys, resulting in increased excretion of bicarbonate, sodium, water, and potassium.  This diuresis is responsible for its effect in edema and glaucoma. The effect on intracranial pressure is likely related to reduced cerebrospinal fluid production. In epilepsy, the mechanism is not fully understood but may involve changes in neuronal excitability.

## **Alternate Names**

**International/Regional Variations:**  Diamox (common brand name used internationally)

**Brand Names:** Diamox, Diamox Sequels.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Acetazolamide primarily acts by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase, leading to diuresis (increased urine production), reduction in intraocular pressure, and decreased cerebrospinal fluid production.  It can also cause mild metabolic acidosis.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
*   **Absorption:** Well-absorbed orally.
*   **Metabolism:** Minimal hepatic metabolism.
*   **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion (unchanged drug).

**Mode of Action:** Acetazolamide binds to the active site of carbonic anhydrase, preventing the enzyme from catalyzing the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. This ultimately reduces bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubules of the kidneys.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Acetazolamide is a reversible inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes, particularly CA II and CA IV.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   **Glaucoma:** 250-1000 mg/day orally, in divided doses. Extended-release capsules: 500 mg twice daily.
*   **Edema:** Initially 250-375 mg/day orally. Maintenance: Alternate days or 2 days on, 1 day off.
*   **Epilepsy:** 250-1000 mg/day orally, in divided doses.
*   **Altitude Sickness:** 250 mg every 8-12 hours or 500 mg extended-release once daily, starting 24-48 hours before ascent. For rapid ascents, 1000 mg/day.

#### **Children:**

*   **Glaucoma:** 10-30 mg/kg/day orally, in divided doses (max 1000 mg/day).
*   **Epilepsy:** 8-30 mg/kg/day orally, in divided doses (max 750 mg/day).

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to potential for electrolyte imbalances and renal/hepatic impairment. Dose adjustments may be necessary.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction needed. Not recommended for severe renal disease (GFR &lt;10 mL/min). 
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in cirrhosis due to risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Use cautiously in less severe liver disease. 
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor closely for electrolyte imbalances, particularly in patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing in clinical scenarios such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest) should be individualized based on patient needs and in consultation with specialists. IV administration may be used in these settings.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are necessary based on renal/hepatic function, electrolyte levels, and other patient-specific factors. Therapeutic drug monitoring may be beneficial.
