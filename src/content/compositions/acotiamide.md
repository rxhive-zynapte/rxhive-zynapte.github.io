## **Usage**

Acotiamide is prescribed for the relief of symptoms associated with functional dyspepsia (FD), a common gastrointestinal disorder.  These symptoms include postprandial fullness (feeling overly full after eating), upper abdominal bloating, early satiety (feeling full after eating only a small amount), and epigastric pain or discomfort.  It is classified as a gastroprokinetic agent, meaning it promotes gastrointestinal motility. Its mechanism of action involves increasing acetylcholine levels, a neurotransmitter crucial for proper digestive function.  Acetylcholine stimulates the muscles of the digestive tract, improving the movement of food through the stomach and intestines. Acotiamide achieves this by antagonizing muscarinic M1 and M2 receptors and inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine.

## **Alternate Names**

Acotiamide is also known as Acotiamide hydrochloride hydrate. Brand names include Acofide, Acotibien, Dycotiam, Actapro, AcoEaze, and Acosat.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Acotiamide primarily affects the gastrointestinal tract by increasing acetylcholine concentration. This leads to enhanced gastric motility and accelerated gastric emptying, thereby alleviating symptoms of functional dyspepsia such as postprandial fullness, bloating, and early satiety.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Acotiamide is administered orally and is readily absorbed.  It reaches a steady-state plasma concentration after approximately three doses. Metabolism and elimination pathways for Acotiamide are not fully elucidated in the provided sources.

**Mode of Action:** Acotiamide works through a dual mechanism:

1. **Muscarinic Receptor Antagonism:** Acotiamide acts as an antagonist at muscarinic M1 and M2 receptors in the enteric nervous system. This antagonism indirectly enhances the release of acetylcholine.

2. **Acetylcholinesterase Inhibition:** Acotiamide also inhibits the activity of acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme responsible for breaking down acetylcholine.  This inhibition increases the overall concentration of acetylcholine within the gut, further promoting gastric motility.

**Elimination pathways:** Detailed specifics of Acotiamide elimination are not present in the provided sources.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard dosage is 100 mg taken orally three times daily before meals. For the extended-release formulation, 300 mg is taken once daily before the main meal. 

#### **Children:**

The safety and efficacy of Acotiamide in children have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment is usually not necessary, but caution is advised due to the potential for age-related decline in organ function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustment may be required for patients with severe renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustment may be required for patients with hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with a history of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, heart disease, or allergies.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources do not offer specific dosage recommendations for clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient factors such as renal or hepatic impairment, as determined by a physician.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

The most common side effects include diarrhea, headache, dizziness, constipation, nausea, vomiting, and rashes.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe allergic reactions such as hives, itching/swelling (especially of the face/tongue/throat), severe dizziness, and difficulty breathing are rare but require immediate medical attention.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Data regarding long-term effects of Acotiamide use are limited in the provided sources.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

## **Drug Interactions**

Acotiamide may interact with:

* **Anticholinergic agents:** These drugs may reduce the effectiveness of Acotiamide.
* **Prokinetic agents:** Concurrent use may enhance gastrointestinal motility effects and should be carefully monitored.
* **Medications metabolized by CYP3A4:**  Acotiamide's interaction with this enzyme is not fully described in the provided sources.

Interactions with alcohol are unknown. Patients should inform their doctor about all medications they are currently taking, including OTC drugs and supplements.
