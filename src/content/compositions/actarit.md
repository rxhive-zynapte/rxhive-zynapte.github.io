      How does Actarit work in rheumatoid arthritis?**

      **A:** It modulates interleukin-2 production, enhancing suppressor T cells
      to prevent autoimmune attacks on joints.  It also directly suppresses
      inflammatory processes.

## **Usage**

- Actarit is prescribed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting the joints.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD).
- **Mechanism of action:** Actarit modulates the production and serum levels of interleukin-2, thereby increasing the production of suppressor T cells, which prevent T-cells from attacking the body's healthy cells. It also suppresses secondary inflammation, relieving joint pain and swelling.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:** No widely recognized international or regional variations for "Actarit" are found.  The active ingredient is 4-acetamidophenylacetic acid.
- **Brand Names:** ActaritÂ®, Aramact.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Actarit exerts anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. It reduces inflammation by suppressing inflammatory agents like prostaglandins and cytokines. Its immunomodulatory action involves inhibiting the excessive activity of immune cells, preventing them from attacking healthy tissues.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Actarit is administered orally and absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Taking it with food can mitigate gastrointestinal side effects.
    - **Metabolism:**  The exact metabolic pathways of actarit are not explicitly detailed in the provided information.
    - **Elimination:** Elimination pathways are not clearly specified, but renal and/or hepatic excretion is likely.
- **Mode of Action:** Actarit modulates interleukin-2 production and increases suppressor T cells, preventing the autoimmune response characteristic of RA.  It also suppresses the synthesis of inflammatory agents like prostaglandins and cytokines.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation is not detailed in the sources.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 300 mg per day, divided into three doses of 100 mg each, taken after meals.

#### **Children:**

- Not indicated for pediatric use.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** 300mg daily, same as adults. Careful monitoring for adverse effects is recommended.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution, dosage adjustments may be needed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution, dosage adjustments may be needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with pre-existing liver or kidney disorders or peptic ulcers.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Data specific to intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations is not provided.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, skin rash, itching, abdominal pain, bloody urine, dry mouth, mouth sores, decreased appetite, cough, and decrease in blood cell count.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Liver function abnormalities and blood dyscrasias (abnormalities in blood cell counts).

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Not specified in the provided information.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

-  Significant ADRs requiring immediate intervention are not specified beyond liver abnormalities and blood dyscrasias.

## **Contraindications**

- Breastfeeding (unless benefits outweigh risks).
- Severe renal or hepatic impairment.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Concomitant use of other DMARDs or immunosuppressive medications requires close monitoring.
- NSAIDs should be used cautiously with Actarit.
- Anticoagulants and other hepatotoxic drugs should be used cautiously.
- Interactions with other commonly prescribed medications, OTC drugs, supplements, food and lifestyle factors are not comprehensively provided, but patients should inform their doctor about all the medicines they are taking.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Not established. Actarit is not recommended unless absolutely necessary, and risks and benefits should be carefully assessed.
- **Fetal Risks:** Potential fetal risks are not specifically identified, but general caution is advised.
- **Drug Excretion in Breast Milk:** Unknown. Breastfeeding is not recommended unless absolutely necessary.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Modulates interleukin-2, suppressing inflammation and the autoimmune response in RA.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, rash; rarely, liver/blood cell abnormalities.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, pregnancy, breastfeeding, severe renal/hepatic impairment.
- **Drug Interactions:** DMARDs, immunosuppressants, NSAIDs, anticoagulants, hepatotoxic drugs.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Not recommended unless absolutely necessary.
- **Dosage:** 300 mg daily (100 mg thrice daily) for adults; not indicated for children.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests, blood cell counts.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Methotrexate: The combination of Actarit and low-dose methotrexate can be beneficial for patients with active RA unresponsive to methotrexate alone.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Pre-screening for allergies, hepatic and renal function, and gastrointestinal issues is recommended.
- **Specific Populations:**  Caution is advised for pregnant or breastfeeding women, and pediatric use is not indicated.
