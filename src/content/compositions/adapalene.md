## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Adapalene is primarily prescribed for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris, especially comedonal (blackheads and whiteheads) and inflammatory acne.  It is indicated for mild to moderate acne where comedones, papules, and pustules predominate.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Adapalene is classified as a retinoid, a derivative of vitamin A.  More specifically, it is a third-generation retinoid.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Adapalene is a retinoid-like compound that modulates cellular differentiation and keratinization, normalizing follicular epithelial cell differentiation. This leads to decreased microcomedone formation and reduces inflammation associated with acne.

## **Alternate Names**

- Adapalene is the generic name.
- **Brand Names:**  Differin, Plixda, Epiduo (in combination with benzoyl peroxide).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Adapalene binds to specific nuclear retinoic acid receptors, influencing gene expression related to cell differentiation, keratinization, and inflammation within the skin.  It exhibits both comedolytic (unclogs pores) and anti-inflammatory properties.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Adapalene is minimally absorbed systemically following topical application. Blood levels remain low even with long-term use.  Limited information is available on its metabolism and elimination pathways after topical administration.
- **Mode of Action:**  Adapalene primarily works by binding to retinoic acid receptors. This inhibits keratinocyte differentiation, reducing the formation of microcomedones (precursors to acne lesions).  The anti-inflammatory effect is achieved by decreasing inflammation mediators.
- **Receptor Binding:**  Binds to nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs).
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily topical; minimal systemic absorption means limited data are available regarding systemic metabolism and excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Apply a thin film of 0.1% or 0.3% gel or cream once daily to the affected areas, preferably at bedtime, after cleansing and drying the skin.
- Start with the 0.1% concentration for initial therapy to minimize irritation. The 0.3% is for more resistant acne.



#### **Children:**

-  Use and dose must be determined by a doctor for patients below 12 years of age. For patients 12 years of age and older, follow adult dosing.
- Pediatric safety considerations: Exercise caution in younger patients due to potential skin sensitivity.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are recommended.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustments are recommended due to minimal systemic absorption.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments are recommended due to minimal systemic absorption.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, or severely irritated skin.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  Adapalene is exclusively for topical dermatological application and is not indicated for clinical situations such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use. Its topical nature makes it unsuitable for any systemic use.  If you are intending to treat acne during or following any of these procedures it is important to wait until the patient is stable and discuss with their physician.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific dosage adjustments are typically required based on renal or hepatic function due to minimal systemic absorption. However, in cases of excessive irritation, the frequency of application can be reduced, or the medication can be temporarily discontinued until symptoms subside.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Dryness
- Scaling
- Burning or stinging
- Redness
- Itching
- Peeling



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions (e.g., hives, itching, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing)
- Severe skin irritation
- Increased sensitivity to sunlight

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Potential for skin discoloration (hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation), though usually reversible upon discontinuation.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Allergic reactions including angioedema, urticaria, and anaphylaxis have been reported rarely.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to adapalene or any component of the formulation.
- Should not be used on open wounds, cuts, or sunburned skin.
- Use with caution during pregnancy.
- Avoid contact with eyes, lips, and mucous membranes.



## **Drug Interactions**

- Concomitant use with other topical acne medications (e.g., benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, resorcinol, sulfur) may increase irritation.
- Medications that increase photosensitivity may exacerbate adapalene's photosensitizing potential.
- Use cautiously with other retinoids.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category (US FDA):** C.
- **Fetal Risks:**  Animal studies showed adverse effects at high doses.  Insufficient data in humans; use only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Unknown if excreted in breast milk.  Use with caution; avoid applying to chest area to prevent infant exposure.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Binds to nuclear retinoic acid receptors, modulating cell differentiation and keratinization; exhibits comedolytic and anti-inflammatory properties.
- **Side Effects:** Dryness, scaling, burning/stinging, redness, itching, peeling. Rarely, allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, open wounds, burns, eczema, severe acne involving large areas. Use with caution during pregnancy.
- **Drug Interactions:**  Other topical acne medications, photosensitizing drugs.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** Apply a thin film once daily, at bedtime, to affected areas.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for skin irritation, allergic reactions, and treatment response.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Adapalene + Benzoyl peroxide (e.g., Epiduo): Combines comedolytic and antibacterial effects for enhanced acne treatment.
- Adapalene + Clindamycin: Combines comedolytic and antibiotic effects.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Avoid contact with eyes, lips, and mucous membranes.  Start with a lower concentration to assess tolerance.
- **Specific Populations:** Use cautiously during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Safe for use in patients 12 years and older, use is not established in children below 12 years.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Protect treated skin from sunlight and use sunscreen. Avoid excessive sun exposure.
