## **Usage**

- Adenosine is primarily used for the conversion of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), including PSVT associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, to sinus rhythm.  It is also used as a pharmacologic stress agent, as an adjunct to thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in patients unable to exercise adequately.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antiarrhythmic, Vasodilator.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Adenosine slows conduction time through the atrioventricular (AV) node, interrupts re-entry pathways through the AV node, and can restore sinus rhythm in patients with PSVT. It is an endogenous nucleoside that activates A1 adenosine receptors, increasing potassium conductance and causing hyperpolarization.  This leads to a transient slowing of the sinus rate and AV nodal conduction.

## **Alternate Names**

- Adenocard (brand name)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Adenosine's primary effect is on the heart, causing transient AV block and slowing sinus node discharge. It is a potent vasodilator of coronary and cerebral resistance vessels.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Adenosine is rapidly absorbed and metabolized by adenosine deaminase, which is present in red blood cells and vascular endothelial cells. It has an extremely short half-life (less than 10 seconds).
- **Mode of Action:** Adenosine interacts with A1 adenosine receptors located in the sinoatrial (SA) and AV nodes. Receptor binding activates potassium channels, leading to hyperpolarization and slowed conduction.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Rapidly metabolized to inosine and subsequently uric acid, primarily in the liver and other tissues. Some renal excretion may also occur.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **PSVT:** 6 mg rapid IV push over 1-3 seconds, followed by a 20 mL saline flush. If no conversion within 1-2 minutes, a second dose of 12 mg can be given. A third dose of 12 mg may be considered if necessary.
- **Myocardial Perfusion Imaging:** 140 mcg/kg/minute IV infusion over 6 minutes.

#### **Children:**

- **PSVT:** Initial dose: 0.1 mg/kg (max 6 mg) rapid IV push, followed by a saline flush. Second dose: 0.2 mg/kg (max 12 mg) if necessary. Third dose: 0.3 mg/kg (max 12 mg) may be considered.
- **Pediatric Safety Considerations:**  Closely monitor heart rate, rhythm, and blood pressure. Be prepared to manage bradycardia or asystole.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose (3 mg) and titrate cautiously.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific adjustments are typically required due to rapid extrahepatic metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with asthma, as bronchospasm may occur.  Reduce initial dose to 3 mg for patients taking dipyridamole or carbamazepine and central line administration.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations:** Dosage as per PSVT guidelines.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Flushing, dyspnea, chest pain, headache, dizziness, nausea.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe bradycardia, asystole, bronchospasm, seizures, hypotension.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Significant hypotension, high-grade AV block, severe bronchospasm.


## **Contraindications**

- Second- or third-degree AV block (except in patients with a functioning pacemaker).
