## **Usage**

- Ado-trastuzumab emtansine is prescribed for **HER2-positive breast cancer**. This includes:
    - **Metastatic breast cancer (MBC):**  For patients who have previously received trastuzumab and a taxane, separately or in combination, and have either received prior therapy for metastatic disease or developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant therapy.
    - **Early breast cancer (EBC) adjuvant treatment:** For patients with residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant taxane and trastuzumab-based treatment.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antineoplastic agent, antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), HER2-targeted therapy.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Ado-trastuzumab emtansine is an ADC that targets the HER2 receptor. The trastuzumab component binds to HER2 on the surface of cancer cells, and the emtansine (DM1) component, a cytotoxic agent, is internalized into the cell. DM1 inhibits microtubule polymerization, disrupting cell division and leading to cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Trastuzumab emtansine
- **Brand Name:** Kadcyla


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ado-trastuzumab emtansine selectively targets HER2-positive cancer cells.  The emtansine component disrupts microtubule function, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (programmed cell death).
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Ado-trastuzumab emtansine is administered intravenously.  The trastuzumab component exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Emtansine is released intracellularly and is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4.  Elimination occurs mainly through hepatic routes, with some renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** Receptor binding (HER2), microtubule inhibition.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism (CYP3A4) and biliary excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **MBC and EBC:** 3.6 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks (21-day cycle). Do not exceed 3.6 mg/kg. Continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (MBC) or for 14 cycles (EBC) unless there is disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. In patients with EBC who did not receive prior neoadjuvant therapy, treatment may be extended to 17 cycles.  The initial dose should be infused over 90 minutes; if well tolerated, subsequent infusions may be administered over 30 minutes.


#### **Children:**  No established dosing guidelines. Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustment is required based on age.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is recommended.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reductions may be necessary. Monitor liver function closely. 
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor closely for adverse events, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**
Ado-trastuzumab emtansine is specifically indicated for HER2-positive breast cancer (MBC and EBC adjuvant treatment).  It is not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose reductions may be required based on adverse events, particularly hepatotoxicity, left ventricular dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, and peripheral neuropathy. Refer to the prescribing information for specific dose reduction schedules.

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**
Fatigue, nausea, musculoskeletal pain, thrombocytopenia, headache, increased transaminases, constipation, peripheral neuropathy.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Hepatotoxicity (including liver failure), left ventricular dysfunction (including heart failure),  infusion-related reactions,  thrombocytopenia,  pulmonary toxicity (including pneumonitis),  peripheral neuropathy (can be severe), embryo-fetal toxicity.

### **Long-Term Effects**
Potential long-term effects may include cardiac dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy.

Ado-trastuzumab emtansine is typically used as a single agent.

## **Precautions**
- Evaluate LVEF and liver function prior to and during treatment.
