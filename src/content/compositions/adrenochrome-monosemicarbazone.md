## **Usage**

- Adrenochrome monosemicarbazone is prescribed for the treatment of capillary bleeding, including conditions like epistaxis (nosebleeds), hematuria (blood in urine), and retinal hemorrhage (bleeding in the eye). It can also be used as an adjunct therapy to manage excessive bleeding in conditions such as menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding), and post-operative hemorrhage.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Hemostatic agent, antihemorrhagic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Adrenochrome monosemicarbazone is thought to reduce capillary fragility and permeability, thereby decreasing bleeding. The exact mechanism is not fully understood but likely involves vasoconstriction and enhanced platelet aggregation.

## **Alternate Names**

- Carbazochrome
- Adrenochrome semicarbazone

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Adrenochrome monosemicarbazone acts locally on capillaries, reducing their fragility and permeability. It also promotes vasoconstriction and improves platelet aggregation, contributing to hemostasis.  The precise molecular mechanism isn't completely elucidated but is likely related to its antioxidant properties and interaction with vascular smooth muscle.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Information on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion is limited. Available data suggests it's readily absorbed after intramuscular or intravenous administration, with rapid onset of action. Information about the metabolic pathways or specific CYP enzyme involvement is scarce. Elimination pathways are not well-defined, although both renal and hepatic excretion are likely involved.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Oral: 1-2 tablets (dosage varies depending on product formulation) three times a day.
- Intramuscular/Subcutaneous Injection: 10 mg daily.
- Intravenous Injection/Infusion: 25-100 mg daily.


#### **Children:**

- Dose adjustments are needed for children. Consult a physician for appropriate dosing based on the child's weight and condition.  Sources suggest children under 6 years may receive 1-2 ml of the injectable form three times a day. Use with caution in pediatric patients as safety and efficacy haven't been conclusively established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to potential age-related organ dysfunction.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be needed based on the patient's creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Exercise caution and consider dosage adjustments.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Carefully consider the patient's overall health status and potential drug interactions before prescribing.

### **Clinical Use Cases:**

Dosage recommendations for these specific use cases are not consistently available in current sources.  Dosage adjustments are typically made based on the individual patient's needs and the severity of bleeding.

- **Intubation:** Data not available.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Pre-operative: 2-6 ml injection at suitable intervals. Post-operative: 1-2 ml every 2 hours.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Data not available.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Data not available.
- **Emergency Situations:** Data not available.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Consult a physician for dosage adjustments based on patient-specific factors, including renal or hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, and other relevant health conditions.
