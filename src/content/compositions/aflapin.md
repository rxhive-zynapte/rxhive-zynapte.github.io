## **Usage**

- Aflapin, a standardized extract of *Boswellia serrata* gum resin, is primarily prescribed for the management of Osteoarthritis (OA), particularly OA of the knee. It is also used for other inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis.
- **Pharmacological Classification**:  Nutritional supplement, anti-inflammatory agent.
- **Mechanism of Action**: Aflapin acts as a selective and potent 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) inhibitor. 5-LOX is an enzyme involved in the production of leukotrienes, which are inflammatory mediators that contribute to pain, swelling, and stiffness in joints. By inhibiting 5-LOX, Aflapin reduces the production of leukotrienes and thus, alleviates the symptoms of OA.

## **Alternate Names**

- AprèsFlex®
- *Boswellia serrata* extract


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Aflapin reduces joint pain, stiffness, and inflammation. It may also improve joint function and mobility. It shows potential in protecting cartilage.
- **Pharmacokinetics**: The specific pharmacokinetic parameters (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of Aflapin have not been fully elucidated. However, it is known that administration with high-fat foods may enhance plasma levels of *Boswellia serrata* extracts. *Boswellia serrata* derived compounds demonstrate inhibition of several CYP enzymes, such as CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4. More research is needed for complete pharmacokinetic profile.
- **Mode of Action**:  Aflapin primarily inhibits 5-LOX, an enzyme responsible for leukotriene synthesis.  It may also inhibit other inflammatory cytokines and enzymes like TNF-α and MMP-3.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation**: Aflapin inhibits the 5-LOX enzyme.  It may also modulate inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α) and cartilage-degrading enzymes (e.g., MMP-3).  The full range of its molecular targets is still being investigated.
- **Elimination Pathways**:  The elimination pathways are yet not fully understood, hepatic metabolism is possible.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults**:
- 100-250 mg/day of Aflapin, usually taken orally in capsule form. Some studies have used higher doses (up to 1000 mg/day) for non-proprietary *Boswellia serrata* extracts.

#### **Children**:
- Safety and efficacy in children have not been established. Use only if recommended by a doctor.

#### **Special Cases**:
- **Elderly Patients**:  No specific dosage adjustments are available.  Caution should be exercised.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Data is limited, therefore caution should be exercised. Consult a nephrologist if required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Data is limited, therefore caution should be exercised. Consult a hepatologist if required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Caution advised; consult a doctor about potential interactions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Specific dosing for clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergencies has not been established.
