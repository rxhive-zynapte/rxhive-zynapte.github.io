## **Usage**

Albumin is prescribed for various medical conditions related to low blood volume (hypovolemia) or low albumin levels (hypoalbuminemia).  These conditions may include:

* Hypovolemia (low blood volume)
* Hypoalbuminemia (low albumin levels)
* Burns
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Nephrosis
* Renal dialysis
* Cardiopulmonary bypass surgery
* Acute liver failure
* Hemolytic disease of the newborn
* Prevention of central volume depletion after paracentesis due to cirrhotic ascites
* Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)


It is pharmacologically classified as a plasma expander and volume replacement agent.

Albumin's mechanism of action involves increasing plasma colloid oncotic pressure.  This helps draw fluid from the interstitial space back into the vascular system, thereby restoring blood volume.

## **Alternate Names**

Albumin is also referred to as human albumin. Several brand names exist, including:

* Albuminar-25
* Alburx
* Albutein
* Albuminex
* Plasbumin
* Buminate
* Flexbumin
* Kedbumin
* Macrotec


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Albumin exerts its primary effect by raising the plasma colloid oncotic pressure, which in turn increases intravascular volume.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Albumin is administered intravenously and distributes rapidly within the intravascular compartment.  It is metabolized by various tissues throughout the body.  The liver is a primary site for albumin catabolism, but kidneys and the gastrointestinal tract also contribute to it.  Elimination of albumin breakdown products involves renal and hepatic pathways.

**Mode of Action:** Albumin exerts its therapeutic effects by increasing osmotic pressure. It binds to water molecules and keeps them within the blood vessels and preventing fluid leak into other tissues. 


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard adult dosage varies depending on the indication and concentration of the albumin solution (5% or 25%).  Dosages typically range from 25g to 75g. It's crucial to adjust dosage based on patient response and monitoring of circulating volume. The maximum daily dose is 2g/kg of body weight.

#### **Children:**

Pediatric dosing is weight-based, typically ranging from 0.5 to 1 g/kg per dose. Limited data exists on efficacy in pediatric populations, necessitating cautious administration based on clinical need.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients**: Infusion rates should be adjusted, particularly for 25% albumin solutions, to minimize the risk of fluid overload.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Dosage adjustments may be needed based on renal function and dialysis status. 
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Adjustments for impaired metabolism may be needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Careful monitoring and dose adjustments are essential in patients with heart failure, hypertension, or other conditions that could be exacerbated by fluid overload.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical situations are as follows:

* **Hypovolemia:** 25g for adults, 2.5g to 12.5g for children.
* **Hypoalbuminemia:** 50g to 75g for adults.
* **Prevention of volume depletion after paracentesis:** 8g for every 1000mL of ascitic fluid removed.
* **Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS):** 50g to 100g over 4 hours, repeated at 4-12 hour intervals as needed.
* **Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS):** 25g over 30 minutes, repeated at 8 hours for 3 days if necessary.
* **Acute nephrosis:** 25g together with a diuretic once a day for 7-10 days.
* **Burns:** Initial dose of 25g after the first 24 hours, followed by adjustments to maintain appropriate plasma protein levels.
* **Cardiopulmonary bypass procedures:** Initial dose of 25g.
* **Hemolytic disease of the newborn:** 1g/kg before or during plasma exchange.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modification is necessary for renal or hepatic dysfunction and other comorbid conditions based on individual patient characteristics.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, rapid heart rate, mild rash, flushing.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Hives, cough, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat, lightheadedness, weak or shallow breathing, throbbing headache, blurred vision, buzzing in the ears, anxiety, confusion, sweating, pale skin, severe shortness of breath, wheezing, gasping for breath, cough with foamy mucus, chest pain, rapid and uneven heart rate, anaphylaxis, fluid overload.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Potential long-term effects include edema (swelling) and fluid overload.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Clinically significant ADRs may include anaphylaxis or severe allergic reactions.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to albumin or any components of the formulation.
* Severe anemia
* Congestive heart failure
* Renal insufficiency with risk of hemodynamic instability
* Conditions where hypervolemia and its consequences or hemodilution could represent a special risk for the patient: Decompensated cardiac insufficiency, Hypertension, Esophageal varices, Pulmonary edema, Hemorrhagic diathesis, Severe anemia, Renal and post-renal anuria


## **Drug Interactions**

Although specific drug interactions are rare, administering albumin with certain medications may warrant dose adjustments. It is important to be vigilant regarding potential drug interactions and consult resources like the FDA or Drugs.com for a more detailed list of reported drug interactions.  Be sure to inform your patients to discuss all medications and supplements they're taking.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Albumin is categorized as Pregnancy Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with albumin.  Its safety during pregnancy has not been established in controlled clinical trials.  Albumin should be administered cautiously during pregnancy only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the fetus.

Albumin is present in breast milk. The decision to breastfeed during albumin therapy should consider the risks of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding, and the benefits of treatment for the mother.
