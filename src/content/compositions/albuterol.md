## **Usage**

Albuterol is prescribed for the treatment and prevention of bronchospasm, a condition where the airways in the lungs tighten, causing difficulty breathing. This is commonly seen in conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Albuterol is also used to prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm.  It is pharmacologically classified as a bronchodilator and a short-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (SABA). Albuterol relaxes the smooth muscles of the airways by selectively stimulating beta2-adrenergic receptors, which leads to bronchodilation and increased airflow to the lungs.

## **Alternate Names**

Albuterol is also known as Salbutamol internationally. Brand names include ProAir HFA, ProAir Respiclick, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA, and various generic versions.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Albuterol acts as a bronchodilator by relaxing the smooth muscle in the airways. This effect is mediated through its selective binding to beta2-adrenergic receptors, resulting in the activation of adenylate cyclase and an increase in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).  Elevated cAMP levels lead to a decrease in intracellular calcium concentrations, causing smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Albuterol is readily absorbed from the lungs after inhalation, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 30 minutes to 2 hours. Oral administration is also possible but less efficient due to extensive first-pass metabolism.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver to an inactive sulfate conjugate.
* **Elimination:** Excreted primarily in the urine as metabolites and a small amount as unchanged drug.  Elimination half-life is approximately 4 to 6 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Albuterol's primary mode of action involves binding to beta2-adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle cells. This binding initiates a cascade of intracellular events, leading to smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation. It does not significantly affect other adrenergic receptors (alpha or beta1), which minimizes systemic side effects.

**Receptor Binding:** Selective agonist of beta2-adrenergic receptors.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion as metabolites and a small amount of unchanged drug.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Metered-Dose Inhaler (MDI):** 2 puffs (180 mcg) every 4 to 6 hours as needed. In some cases, 1 puff (90 mcg) every 4 hours may be sufficient. Maximum: 12 puffs (1080 mcg) per day.
* **Nebulizer:** 2.5 mg three to four times daily as needed.
* **Oral (Immediate Release):** 2 to 4 mg three to four times daily.  May increase up to 8 mg four times daily. Maximum: 32 mg/day.
* **Oral (Extended Release):** 4 to 8 mg every 12 hours. May increase up to 16 mg every 12 hours.

#### **Children:**

* **MDI (4 years and older):**  2 puffs (180 mcg) every 4 to 6 hours as needed.  Do not exceed 12 inhalations/24 hours.
* **Nebulizer (2-12 years):** 0.63 to 1.25 mg three to four times daily as needed. Consider weight-based dosing (0.15 to 0.3 mg/kg/dose up to 10 mg/dose). May increase up to 10 mg. 
* **Oral (2-6 years):** 0.1 mg/kg every 8 hours initially (maximum 2 mg per dose). May increase to 0.2 mg/kg every 8 hours (maximum 4 mg per dose).
* **Oral (6-14 years):** 2 mg every 6 to 8 hours. May increase up to 24 mg/day in divided doses.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and titrate upwards as needed, monitoring for adverse effects. Consider starting extended-release tablets at 4 mg every 12 hours. Oral immediate-release: start with 2 mg three to four times daily.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required, but careful monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are explicitly provided in the manufacturer's labeling. However, caution and monitoring are advisable due to potential alterations in metabolism.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, hyperthyroidism, or seizure disorders.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Intubation:** Nebulized albuterol can be administered during intubation to facilitate airway management.
* **Surgical Procedures:** May be used pre- or post-operatively to manage bronchospasm.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** Nebulized albuterol 2.5 mg every 20 minutes or continuous nebulization (10â€“15 mg/hour initially) is frequently used for bronchodilation in intubated asthmatics.  Use spacer device with MDI for optimal delivery.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Continuous nebulization or frequent nebulized treatments may be necessary in critically ill patients. Doses up to 20 mg/hour have been reported in children with status asthmaticus.
* **Emergency Situations (e.g., acute asthma exacerbation):** Nebulized 2.5-5 mg every 20 minutes for three doses, followed by 2.5-10 mg every 1-4 hours as needed. Continuous nebulization (10-15 mg/hr or more) is an alternative for severe cases.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are made based on patient response, tolerance, and concurrent medical conditions.  Close monitoring is crucial.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Tremor, nervousness, headache, tachycardia, palpitations, muscle cramps.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (e.g., rash, hives, itching, angioedema), paradoxical bronchospasm, cardiac arrhythmias, hypokalemia.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Tolerance to bronchodilator effects, worsening of asthma control (with overuse).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, angina, myocardial ischemia, hyperglycemia, seizures.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to albuterol or any component of the formulation.

## **Drug Interactions**

Beta-blockers (antagonize albuterol's effects), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), diuretics (may exacerbate hypokalemia), digoxin (potential for arrhythmias).

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (FDA). Use only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:** Albuterol is excreted in breast milk. Exercise caution and monitor the infant for potential adverse effects.
