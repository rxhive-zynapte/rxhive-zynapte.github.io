## **Usage**

- Alendronic acid is primarily prescribed for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. It is also used in men for the treatment of osteoporosis.  Additionally, it's indicated for the treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and Paget's disease of bone.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Bisphosphonate
- **Mechanism of Action:** Alendronic acid inhibits osteoclast activity, reducing bone resorption and turnover. This allows osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) to work more effectively, leading to increased bone mineral density and reduced fracture risk.

## **Alternate Names**

- Alendronate sodium (salt form)
- **Brand Names:** Fosamax, Binosto

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Alendronic acid binds to hydroxyapatite crystals on bone surfaces, inhibiting osteoclast activity.  This reduces bone resorption and turnover, leading to a net increase in bone mineral density.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Oral absorption is low (less than 1%) and further reduced by food and certain medications.
    - **Distribution:**  Distributes rapidly to bone surfaces.
    - **Metabolism:** Not metabolized.
    - **Elimination:**  Primarily excreted unchanged in urine; a small portion is taken up by bone.  The elimination half-life is estimated to be more than 10 years due to its slow release from the skeletal system.
- **Mode of Action:**  Alendronic acid inhibits farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, an enzyme essential for osteoclast function and survival.  This disruption of the mevalonate pathway in osteoclasts leads to their apoptosis (programmed cell death), thus decreasing bone resorption.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Osteoporosis (Treatment):** 70 mg orally once weekly OR 10 mg orally once daily.
- **Osteoporosis (Prevention):** 35 mg orally once weekly OR 5 mg orally once daily (postmenopausal women).
- **Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis:** 5 mg orally once daily, OR 10 mg orally once daily in postmenopausal women not receiving estrogen.
- **Paget's Disease:** 40 mg orally once daily for 6 months.

#### **Children:**

- Alendronate is not recommended for use in children under 18 years old due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is needed for creatinine clearance greater than 35 mL/min. Not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment is necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  The provided sources do not mention clinical use cases for alendronic acid with Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, or Emergency Situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**  Dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 35 mL/min).  In these cases, alendronate is generally not recommended.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Abdominal pain
- Acid regurgitation
- Constipation
- Diarrhea
- Dyspepsia
- Esophageal ulcer
- Flatulence
- Headache
- Musculoskeletal pain


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Atypical femoral fractures
- Esophageal cancer
- Osteonecrosis of the jaw


### **Long-Term Effects**

- Potential for atypical femoral fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw with prolonged use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Esophageal reactions (esophagitis, erosions, ulcers)
- Musculoskeletal pain (severe and incapacitating)
- Hypocalcemia
- Osteonecrosis of the jaw
- Atypical femur fractures
- Ocular inflammation (uveitis, scleritis)


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to alendronic acid or any component of the formulation.
- Hypocalcemia
- Abnormalities of the esophagus which delay esophageal emptying (e.g., stricture, achalasia).
- Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Antacids, calcium supplements, and other medications containing multivalent cations (e.g., iron, magnesium) interfere with alendronate absorption and should be taken at least 2 hours apart.
- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase the risk of gastrointestinal irritation.
- Certain medications can affect calcium levels and interact with alendronate.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Alendronate is generally avoided during pregnancy due to limited data on safety for the developing fetus.
- **Breastfeeding:** Alendronate is excreted in breast milk in small amounts.  The risk to the breastfed infant is considered low, but caution is advised.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.
- **Side Effects:** Abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, esophageal irritation, osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical femoral fractures.
- **Contraindications:**  Hypocalcemia, esophageal abnormalities, inability to sit upright for 30 minutes, hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:** Antacids, calcium supplements, NSAIDs.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution.  Generally avoided during pregnancy.
- **Dosage:**  Variable depending on indication; 70 mg once weekly or 10 mg once daily for osteoporosis treatment.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Bone mineral density, serum calcium and phosphate, renal function.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Alendronate is often combined with vitamin D (colecalciferol) to enhance calcium absorption and bone health. Calcium supplements may also be prescribed if dietary intake is insufficient.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D intake.  Perform dental examination prior to treatment and encourage good oral hygiene.
- **Specific Populations:** As described above.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Advise patients to avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.
