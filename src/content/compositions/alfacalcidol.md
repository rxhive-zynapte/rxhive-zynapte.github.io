      How does Alfacalcidol differ from other forms of vitamin D?**


      **A:** Alfacalcidol is a synthetic analog of vitamin D and a direct
      precursor to calcitriol (the active form), requiring less metabolic
      activation.  This makes it faster acting than other forms like vitamin D3
      (cholecalciferol).

## **Usage**

Alfacalcidol is prescribed for various medical conditions related to calcium and phosphate metabolism, often arising from vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. This includes:

* **Renal osteodystrophy:** Bone disease associated with chronic kidney disease.
* **Hypoparathyroidism:**  Low levels of parathyroid hormone, leading to hypocalcemia.
* **Pseudohypoparathyroidism:** Resistance to parathyroid hormone, also resulting in hypocalcemia.
* **Vitamin D-resistant rickets and osteomalacia:**  Softening of the bones due to impaired vitamin D metabolism.
* **Vitamin D-dependent rickets:**  Genetic disorders affecting vitamin D metabolism.
* **Hypocalcemia:** Low blood calcium levels.
* **Postmenopausal osteoporosis:** Loss of bone density in postmenopausal women.


**Pharmacological Classification:** Vitamin D analog, specifically a synthetic precursor of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol), the active form of vitamin D.

**Mechanism of Action:** Alfacalcidol is rapidly converted in the liver to calcitriol, which regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis by promoting their absorption in the intestines and reabsorption in the kidneys.  It also influences bone metabolism.

## **Alternate Names**

* **One-Alpha**
* **Alfagamma**


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Alfacalcidol's primary effect is to increase serum calcium and phosphate levels. Calcitriol (the active form) binds to vitamin D receptors in the intestines, kidneys, and bone, modulating gene transcription related to calcium and phosphate transport.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:** Alfacalcidol is well-absorbed orally. Food can slightly enhance absorption.
* **Metabolism:** Rapidly converted to calcitriol in the liver.
* **Elimination:** Excreted mainly in bile and feces, with a small amount in urine.


**Mode of Action:** Alfacalcidol is a prodrug of calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D. Calcitriol binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a nuclear receptor that heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). This complex then binds to vitamin D response elements (VDREs) in the DNA, regulating the transcription of genes involved in calcium and phosphate transport.

**Receptor Binding:** Vitamin D receptor (VDR).

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic (biliary and fecal), with some renal excretion.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
Initial: 1 mcg/day orally.  Maintenance: 0.25–1 mcg/day, adjusted according to serum calcium and phosphate levels.

#### **Children:**
Dosing is weight-based.  Consult pediatric dosing guidelines for specific recommendations and safety considerations.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Initial: 0.5 mcg/day, with careful titration based on serum calcium levels.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary based on the degree of impairment. For hemodialysis patients, the dose is typically administered into the return line of the dialysis machine.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution; dosage adjustment may be required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring for drug interactions and adjustments as needed, particularly with thiazide diuretics, calcium supplements, and anticonvulsants.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific clinical settings is individualized based on the underlying condition and response to therapy. The information provided in the sources primarily focus on chronic conditions like renal osteodystrophy and hypoparathyroidism rather than acute settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage should be titrated based on serum calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone levels, along with clinical response.  Frequent monitoring is essential, particularly during initial therapy and dose adjustments. Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism have not been specifically mentioned.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Constipation
* Weakness
* Skin rash
* Itching
* Abdominal pain

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypercalcemia (high calcium levels) leading to:
    * Cardiac arrhythmias
    * Confusion
    * Muscle weakness
    * Generalized vascular and soft tissue calcification
    * Nephrocalcinosis

### **Long-Term Effects:**  Long-term hypercalcemia can contribute to nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) and renal impairment.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Hypercalcemia is the most significant ADR and requires immediate dose reduction or discontinuation.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypercalcemia
* Hyperphosphatemia (except in hypoparathyroidism)
* Hypervitaminosis D
* Hypersensitivity to alfacalcidol or any components of the formulation
* Evidence of vitamin D toxicity

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Thiazide diuretics:** Increased risk of hypercalcemia.
* **Calcium supplements:** Increased risk of hypercalcemia.
* **Anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine):** Increased alfacalcidol metabolism, potentially requiring higher doses.
* **Magnesium-containing antacids:** Increased risk of hypermagnesemia.
* **Aluminum-containing preparations:** Increased risk of aluminum toxicity.
* **Mineral oil:** Decreased alfacalcidol absorption.
* **Bile acid sequestrants (e.g., cholestyramine):** Decreased alfacalcidol absorption.
* **Digitalis glycosides:** Hypercalcemia can potentiate the effects of digitalis, increasing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Alfacalcidol is generally not recommended during pregnancy due to the risk of hypercalcemia in the mother and potential adverse effects on the fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:** Alfacalcidol may be excreted in breast milk and could affect calcium metabolism in the infant. Breastfeeding during treatment should be avoided.
