## **Usage**

Alginic acid is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and other related conditions where gastric acid reflux is the underlying cause. This includes heartburn, acid regurgitation, dyspepsia, hiatus hernia, reflux esophagitis, and epigastric/retrosternal discomfort. It also finds use in managing heartburn during pregnancy.

Alginic acid is classified as an antacid.

Its mechanism of action involves reacting with gastric acid to form a viscous, floating "raft" of alginate gel. This gel acts as a physical barrier, preventing the reflux of acidic stomach contents into the esophagus.  In cases where reflux still occurs, the raft is refluxed preferentially, providing a soothing effect on the esophageal mucosa.


## **Alternate Names**

Alginic acid is also known as alginate. Brand names include Gaviscon, Acidex, Algina, and various generic formulations.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Alginic acid works primarily through a physical mechanism, forming a protective barrier against gastric acid reflux. It does not depend on systemic absorption for its effect. The alginate gel raft created in the stomach has a near-neutral pH, which helps neutralize gastric acid. This protective raft can last for up to 4 hours.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Alginic acid itself is not absorbed systemically. The alginate gel formed in the stomach is either eliminated through the gastrointestinal tract or, in cases of severe reflux, may be refluxed into the esophagus where it exerts a soothing effect.  Other components present in alginic acid-containing medications, such as calcium carbonate, may be absorbed to a small extent.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
* Oral suspension: 10-20 ml after meals and at bedtime, up to four times a day.
* Chewable tablets: 2-4 tablets after meals and at bedtime, as prescribed. The maximum recommended dose can vary depending on the specific formulation.


#### **Children:**
* 6 to 12 years: 5-10 ml of oral suspension or 1-2 chewable tablets, after meals and at bedtime, up to four times a day, or as prescribed.
* Under 6 years: Use is generally not recommended without medical advice.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are typically required.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised if the patient is on a highly restricted salt diet, as some formulations contain sodium. Monitor calcium, phosphate, and magnesium levels.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments are required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consult a physician for individualized dosage recommendations.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing in specialized settings typically follows the standard adult or pediatric recommendations as appropriate. It's crucial to consult the product's specific instructions.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient factors, such as the severity of symptoms, the presence of renal impairment, and concomitant medications. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels is advisable in patients with renal impairment.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Mild constipation, diarrhea, nausea, mild stomach cramps, altered sense of taste.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Severe stomach pain, constipation, bloody or tarry stools, coughing up blood, swelling in ankles or feet, worsening of stomach condition, hypersensitivity reactions (rash, urticaria, itching, difficulty breathing, chest tightness, swelling of face, lips, tongue).


## **Contraindications**

* Intestinal obstruction
* Hypersensitivity to alginic acid or any components of the formulation
* Hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, nephrolithiasis (in formulations containing calcium)
* Severe renal impairment



## **Drug Interactions**

Alginic acid can hinder the absorption of various medications including tetracyclines, quinolones, bisphosphonates, levothyroxine, dolutegravir, eltrombopag, and cardiac glycosides (e.g., digoxin). It can also interact with other antacids. Maintain a 2-hour interval between alginic acid and other medications.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Alginic acid is generally considered safe during pregnancy. However, safety during breastfeeding has not been fully established, though existing data suggest minimal risk. Always consult a physician before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Forms a protective raft on stomach contents, preventing reflux.
* **Side Effects:** Generally mild and include constipation, nausea, diarrhea. Rarely, hypersensitivity.
* **Contraindications:** Intestinal obstruction, hypersensitivity, hypercalcemia, severe renal impairment (with certain formulations).
* **Drug Interactions:** May decrease absorption of certain drugs (e.g., tetracyclines).
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe during pregnancy; consult physician before use during breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 10-20ml or 2-4 tablets after meals and at bedtime, up to four times/day. Children (6-12 years): 5-10 ml or 1-2 tablets. 
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor electrolyte levels, especially in patients with renal impairment.


## **Popular Combinations**

Alginic acid is often combined with antacids like calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate for enhanced acid-neutralizing capacity.


## **Precautions**

* Assess for allergies, metabolic disorders, and organ dysfunction before use.
* Caution in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Consider sodium content for patients on restricted diets.
