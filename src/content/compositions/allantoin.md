## **Usage**

- Allantoin is primarily used as a topical skin protectant. It is prescribed for various skin conditions such as dryness, roughness, minor irritations (e.g., chapped lips, diaper rash), and to promote wound healing. It can also be found in oral hygiene products.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Skin Protectant, Keratolytic, Anti-inflammatory (mild), Emollient.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Allantoin promotes cell proliferation and tissue regeneration, which aids in wound healing.  It has moisturizing and keratolytic actions, softening keratin and promoting cell turnover. Allantoin is also mildly anti-inflammatory, soothing irritated skin.

## **Alternate Names**

-  Aluminum Dihydroxy Allantoinate
- **Brand Names:**  Many skincare and wound care products containing allantoin are available over-the-counter, often in combination with other ingredients. Consult product labeling for specifics.  One example is *Seniorclean Bio*.  Another example is *DRS. PHARMACY SCAR CREAM*.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Allantoin increases the water content of the extracellular matrix, leading to skin hydration. Its keratolytic action promotes desquamation of dead skin cells.  The exact anti-inflammatory mechanism is unclear but involves mitigating irritation.
- **Pharmacokinetics (Topical):** Allantoin is well-absorbed topically.  Systemic absorption is minimal with topical application. Information regarding its metabolism and excretion after topical use is limited.
- **Mode of Action:** Promotes cell proliferation and stimulates healthy tissue production, specifically granulation tissue.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Specifics about receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation are not well-defined.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Data on allantoin elimination after topical application are scarce. After systemic administration, it is primarily excreted renally.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Topical: Apply a cream or ointment containing 0.5% to 2% allantoin to the affected area 1-3 times daily, or as directed by a healthcare professional. Concentrations up to 5% may be prescribed for specific conditions.
