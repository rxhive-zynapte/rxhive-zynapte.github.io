## **Usage**

Allopurinol is prescribed for the management of conditions characterized by hyperuricemia, including:

* **Gout:**  A form of arthritis caused by the accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints.
* **Uric acid nephropathy:** Kidney disease caused by uric acid crystal formation in the kidneys.
* **Kidney stones (uric acid and calcium oxalate):** Prevention of formation or recurrence.
* **Hyperuricemia secondary to malignancy or Lesch-Nyhan syndrome:**  Elevated uric acid levels due to cancer treatment or the rare genetic disorder.
* **Tumor Lysis Syndrome:** Elevated uric acid levels caused by the breakdown of cancer cells during chemotherapy.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Xanthine oxidase inhibitor.

**Mechanism of Action:** Allopurinol reduces uric acid production by inhibiting the enzyme xanthine oxidase, which is responsible for converting hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid.

## **Alternate Names**

* **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Allopurinol
* **Brand Names:** Zyloprim, Aloprim

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Allopurinol and its active metabolite, oxypurinol, decrease serum and urinary uric acid levels by inhibiting xanthine oxidase. This action prevents the formation of uric acid crystals, which are responsible for the symptoms of gout and other related conditions.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Allopurinol is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 1-2 hours.
* **Metabolism:**  Allopurinol is metabolized in the liver primarily to oxypurinol, which also inhibits xanthine oxidase and has a longer half-life than allopurinol.
* **Elimination:** Oxypurinol is primarily excreted by the kidneys.  Allopurinol is also excreted renally. Dose adjustment is necessary in renal impairment.


**Mode of Action:** Allopurinol acts as a competitive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, binding to the enzyme's active site and preventing the conversion of hypoxanthine and xanthine to uric acid.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Allopurinol's primary mechanism is enzyme inhibition of xanthine oxidase.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of both allopurinol and its active metabolite, oxypurinol.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Gout:** Initial dose: 100 mg orally once daily.  Increase weekly by 100 mg until the target serum uric acid level (usually <6 mg/dL) is reached. Maximum dose: 800-900 mg/day. Dosages >300mg should be divided into two doses.
* **Hyperuricemia secondary to malignancy:** 600-800 mg/day orally divided into 2-3 doses, starting 1-2 days before chemotherapy.
* **Prevention of recurrent kidney stones:** 200-300 mg/day orally in single or divided doses.


#### **Children:**

* **Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or hyperuricemia secondary to malignancy:** Dosing must be individualized based on weight and clinical response. General recommendations are 10-20 mg/kg/day divided into 2-3 doses (max: 400 mg/day) or based on body surface area (BSA) calculation.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start at a lower dose (e.g., 50 mg/day) and titrate cautiously to minimize the risk of adverse effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce the dose based on creatinine clearance (CrCl).  
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments are typically required, but monitor closely for adverse effects.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring is recommended for patients with comorbidities, especially cardiovascular disease and diabetes.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  Allopurinol isn't typically administered through intravenous routes or used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, the intensive care unit (ICU), or emergency situations. Rasburicase or Febuxostat might be preferred in acute conditions or tumor lysis syndrome.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are necessary based on renal function, patient response, and concomitant medications. Consider pharmacogenomic testing for HLA-B*58:01 allele in patients at high risk of hypersensitivity reactions, particularly those of Han Chinese, Thai, or Korean descent.

* **Cytotoxic drugs (e.g., cyclophosphamide):** Potential for increased bone marrow suppression.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  C (data are limited, risks to fetus cannot be ruled out)
