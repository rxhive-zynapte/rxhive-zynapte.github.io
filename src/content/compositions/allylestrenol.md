      How does Allylestrenol work to prevent miscarriage?**


      **A:** Allylestrenol works by mimicking the actions of progesterone, a
      hormone crucial for maintaining pregnancy. It helps stabilize the uterine
      lining, supports placental function, and prevents uterine contractions.
      It's important to note that its efficacy in preventing miscarriage is
      primarily seen in cases of proven progesterone deficiency.

## **Usage**

Allylestrenol is a synthetic progestogen, structurally similar to progesterone. It is primarily prescribed to prevent miscarriage (both threatened and recurrent) and premature labor in pregnant women with progesterone deficiency. Although traditionally used for these purposes, recent evidence suggests limited efficacy in preventing miscarriage unless progesterone deficiency is established.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Progestogen, Steroid hormone.

**Mechanism of Action:**  Allylestrenol binds to progesterone receptors, mimicking the effects of natural progesterone. It supports pregnancy by promoting placental function, stimulating the production of placental hormones (e.g., progesterone, estriol, hCG), and reducing uterine contractility via Î²2-adrenergic receptor stimulation.


## **Alternate Names**

While "Allylestrenol" is the generic name, it is marketed under various brand names internationally, such as:  Arandal, Aroserine, Cobarenol, Elmolan, Gravynon, Maintane Tab, Perselin, Pregnolin, and Turinal. Brand names in India include Noteron, Ecogest, Menor-N, Corolut-N, Prevent N, Uflox (400 mg), Sofnin, Foegard, Regestrone, and Rensure.



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Allylestrenol primarily acts on the uterus, placenta, and potentially the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. It exerts its therapeutic effect by binding to progesterone receptors. This leads to the following effects crucial for maintaining pregnancy:

* **Transformation of the endometrium:**  Prepares the uterine lining for implantation and supports the developing fetus.
* **Placental development and function:** Stimulates placental hormone production, promoting fetal growth and development.
* **Reduction of uterine contractility:** Relaxes the uterine muscles, preventing premature labor.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Limited information is available on allylestrenol's pharmacokinetic profile.

* **Absorption:** Assumed to be absorbed orally.
* **Metabolism:** Likely metabolized in the liver.
* **Elimination:** The exact pathways are unclear, but it's believed to be excreted as metabolites through urine and bile, potentially involving enterohepatic recirculation.

**Receptor Binding:** Allylestrenol binds to progesterone receptors. It has little estrogenic or androgenic activity, distinguishing it from some other progestogens.

**Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** No specific enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation is documented for allylestrenol.


## **Dosage**

Dosage guidelines vary according to the specific condition being addressed:

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Threatened Miscarriage (progesterone deficiency):** 5 mg three times daily for 5-7 days. Treatment can be prolonged if necessary, with gradual dose reduction if symptoms improve.
* **Recurrent Miscarriage:** 5-10 mg daily, starting as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and continuing for at least one month after the critical period.
* **Premature Labor:** Dosage individualized, up to a maximum of 40 mg daily.

#### **Children:** Not recommended for children under 16 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage recommendations; exercise caution due to potential age-related decline in organ function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; dose adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with heart disease, epilepsy, migraine, asthma, diabetes, and renal dysfunction. Close monitoring is essential.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Allylestrenol is not typically employed in the clinical settings mentioned (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, emergency situations). Its use is primarily confined to pregnancy-related conditions as outlined above.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are generally made based on patient response and tolerance. Dose reductions are often implemented if symptoms improve.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Breast tenderness
* Bloating
* Fluid retention (edema)
* Changes in libido
* Menstrual irregularities

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* **Enzyme-inducing drugs:** Anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone), antifungals (griseofulvin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole), and rifampicin. These can decrease allylestrenol levels.
* **Enzyme-inhibiting drugs:** May increase allylestrenol levels.
* **Anticoagulants (warfarin):** Effects may be altered; close monitoring required.
* **Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants:** May affect allylestrenol metabolism.
