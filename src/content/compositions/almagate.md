## **Usage**

- Almagate is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of gastrointestinal conditions associated with hyperacidity, such as:
    - Gastritis
    - Dyspepsia
    - Hyperchlorhydria
    - Peptic ulcer disease (gastric and duodenal ulcers)
    - Esophagitis
    - Hiatal hernia
    - Heartburn
    - Bloating and gas


- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antacid

- **Mechanism of Action:** Almagate is a combination of aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide. It works by neutralizing excess stomach acid, thereby increasing gastric pH and reducing the damaging effects of acid on the gastrointestinal mucosa.

## **Alternate Names**

- Aluminum magnesium hydroxide
- Hydrated magnesium aluminate
- International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Almagate
- **Brand Names:**  Almax, Almax Forte, Aldrin, Alamag, ConRx AR, Maalox HRF, Maalox TC, Maldroxal, Mintox Tablets, Mylanta Ultimate Strength, Rulox, Almacone

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Almagate increases gastric pH by neutralizing hydrochloric acid in the stomach, forming aluminum chloride, magnesium chloride, and water. This chemical reaction leads to a decrease in pepsin activity (an enzyme that contributes to acid-mediated mucosal damage). Almagate also reduces phosphate absorption and may cause hypophosphatemia in cases of excessive and prolonged treatment.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Almagate exhibits poor systemic absorption; hence its effects are primarily localized to the gastrointestinal tract. Absorbed aluminum and magnesium ions are renally excreted, while the unabsorbed portion is eliminated in the feces.

- **Mode of Action:** Almagate acts through direct chemical neutralization of gastric acid, and it does not involve receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation.


- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily fecal excretion; renal excretion of absorbed aluminum and magnesium.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 1-1.5 g (or equivalent volume of suspension) three times a day, 1/2 to 1 hour after meals. An additional dose may be taken before bedtime if needed.
- Maximum daily dosage: 8 g.
- Chewable tablets should be chewed or allowed to dissolve in the mouth. The suspension can be taken directly or mixed with a small amount of water.


#### **Children:**

- 6-12 years: Half the adult dose.
- Use of the suspension formulation is recommended for children. 
- Avoid administering antacids to children under 6 years old, as they may mask underlying conditions.  In small children, there is a risk of hypermagnesemia or aluminum toxicity, especially if dehydrated or with renal impairment. 

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is generally needed, but monitor for potential side effects. Avoid prolonged use of aluminum-containing antacids, which can exacerbate existing bone conditions like osteoporosis and osteomalacia. Do not administer to patients with Alzheimer's disease.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use cautiously in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Avoid high doses. Not recommended in severe renal impairment due to possible aluminum and magnesium accumulation.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose modifications are typically required. Monitor for potential side effects.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use cautiously in patients with hypophosphatemia, dehydration, low phosphate diet, and intestinal malabsorption. Monitor phosphate levels in these patients.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Almagate's use in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, and emergency situations is not routinely indicated. Its primary role is in managing dyspepsia and other hyperacidity-related symptoms.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be needed based on patient-specific factors like renal function, phosphate levels, and concomitant medications.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Diarrhea (generally mild and transient)
- Constipation

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Hypophosphatemia (especially with prolonged use or low-phosphate diets)
- Osteomalacia (with prolonged high doses or in susceptible patients)
- Hypermagnesemia (especially in patients with renal impairment)
- Aluminum toxicity (especially in patients with renal impairment)
- Allergic reactions

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Osteomalacia and aluminum toxicity may occur with chronic, high-dose use, especially in patients with renal impairment and low phosphate levels.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Hypermagnesemia (in patients with renal impairment): Monitor for symptoms like muscle weakness, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension. 
-  Allergic reactions (rare): These can range from mild skin rash and itching to severe anaphylaxis. Stop the medication and provide appropriate management if an allergic reaction occurs.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to almagate or its components
- Alzheimer's disease
- Undiagnosed gastrointestinal bleeding
- Severe renal impairment


## **Drug Interactions**

Almagate can affect the absorption of various medications. Administer other drugs at least 2-3 hours apart from almagate. Some clinically significant interactions include:

- Tetracycline antibiotics
- Quinolone antibiotics (e.g., ciprofloxacin)
- Iron salts
- Levothyroxine
- Digoxin
- Ketoconazole
- NSAIDs
- H2 blockers (e.g., ranitidine)
- Phosphate supplements


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Use only if clearly needed. Some studies have reported isolated cases of hypercalcemia, hypermagnesemia, and hypomagnesemia with long-term antacid use during pregnancy. Discuss risks and benefits with the patient.

- **Breastfeeding:** Small amounts of aluminum and magnesium may be excreted in breast milk, but it's generally considered safe for short-term use at recommended doses. Avoid long-term or excessive use.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Neutralizes gastric acid.
- **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, constipation, hypophosphatemia (rare).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, Alzheimer's disease, severe renal impairment.
- **Drug Interactions:** Affects absorption of several drugs (e.g., tetracyclines, quinolones, iron).
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use cautiously if clearly needed.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 1-1.5 g TID; Children (6-12 years): Half the adult dose.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Serum phosphate levels (in long-term use or special cases), renal function (in patients with renal impairment).


## **Popular Combinations**

Almagate is often combined with simethicone (an antiflatulent) to address both hyperacidity and gas-related discomfort.


## **Precautions**

- Renal impairment: Monitor renal function and adjust dosage accordingly.
- Hypophosphatemia: Monitor serum phosphate levels, especially in long-term use.
- Drug interactions: Advise patients about potential interactions with other medications.
- Children and elderly: Monitor carefully for potential adverse effects.
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding: Use with caution if clearly needed.
