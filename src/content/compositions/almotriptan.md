      How does Almotriptan differ from other triptans?**


      **A:** Almotriptan is similar to other triptans in its mechanism of action
      and efficacy. It has a moderate half-life (3-4 hours).  Individual patient
      response and tolerability to different triptans may vary, leading to a
      preference for one over another.

      patterns. Maintaining a headache diary can help identify these triggers. 
      Patients experiencing drowsiness should avoid operating machinery or
      driving. Patients should also be cautioned against the overuse of
      almotriptan or other acute migraine medications, which can lead to
      medication overuse headache.

## **Usage**

- Almotriptan malate is prescribed for the **acute treatment of migraine attacks** in adults and adolescents (12-17 years old) with or without aura. It is **not** intended for migraine prevention or for other types of headaches like cluster headaches, hemiplegic migraine or basilar migraine.  It is most effective when taken at the first sign of a migraine. Its use is restricted to situations where a clear diagnosis of migraine has been established.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Selective serotonin (5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub>) receptor agonist, antimigraine agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Almotriptan selectively binds to 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptors located on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves associated with the trigeminal system. This binding leads to vasoconstriction of cranial blood vessels, reduces inflammation, and inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides, thus relieving migraine pain and associated symptoms like nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Almotriptan.
- **Brand Names:** Axert, Dezamigren, Mylan-Almotriptan, Sandoz Almotriptan and various other generics.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Almotriptan exerts its therapeutic effect by acting as a selective agonist at 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors. Stimulation of these receptors results in vasoconstriction of intracranial blood vessels, believed to be the primary mechanism of action in migraine relief. This action reduces vasodilation and neurogenic inflammation, which are key components of migraine pathophysiology. Additionally, almotriptan inhibits the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide involved in pain transmission.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Well-absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 1 to 3 hours. Food does not significantly affect absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by the liver, involving CYP3A4 enzymes.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted mainly in the urine, with a half-life of approximately 3 to 4 hours.


- **Mode of Action:** Almotriptan acts by binding to 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptors, causing:
    - **Cranial Vasoconstriction:** Reduces vasodilation of intracranial arteries.
    - **Inhibition of Trigeminal Nerve Activation:** Decreases the release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides such as CGRP, substance P, and neurokinin A, thereby reducing pain transmission.

- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**
    - **Receptor Binding:**  Selective agonist at 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptors.
    - **Enzyme Inhibition:** Minimal inhibition of CYP isoenzymes.
    - **Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism by CYP3A4, followed by renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (18-65 years):**

- Initial dose: 6.25 mg or 12.5 mg orally as a single dose. 12.5 mg is generally more effective.
- If migraine returns after initial relief, a second dose may be taken after at least 2 hours.
- Maximum daily dose: 25 mg (two 12.5 mg tablets or four 6.25 mg tablets).
- The benefit of a second dose if the first dose is ineffective has not been established.

#### **Children (12-17 years):**

- Initial dose: 6.25 mg or 12.5 mg orally as a single dose. Individualize dosage selection based on patient response.
- If headache returns, a second dose may be taken after 2 hours.
- Maximum daily dose: 25 mg.
- Safety and efficacy for treating more than four headaches in a 30-day period have not been established. Not for use in children under 12.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients (over 65 years):** Start with a lower dose (6.25 mg) due to potential age-related decrease in renal, hepatic, or cardiac function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    - Mild to moderate: No dosage adjustment is necessary.
    - Severe (Creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min): Initial dose: 6.25 mg; maximum daily dose: 12.5 mg.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Initial dose: 6.25 mg; maximum daily dose: 12.5 mg.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with cardiovascular risk factors.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Almotriptan is specifically indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks. It's not intended for other clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest).

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- **Concomitant Use with Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole):** Start with 6.25 mg; maximum daily dose: 12.5 mg. Avoid coadministration in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Dry mouth, nausea, vomiting.
- Numbness, tingling, or burning sensations (paresthesia).
- Dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue.
- Headache (not a migraine).
- Somnolence.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions (e.g., hives, angioedema, difficulty breathing).
- Chest pain, tightness, or pressure (angina).
- Myocardial infarction, stroke.
- Serotonin syndrome.
- Peripheral vascular ischemia.
- Hypertension.
- Seizures (rare).
- Visual disturbances.
- Syncope.
- Vertigo.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Medication overuse headache (MOH) can occur with frequent triptan use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, chest pain, myocardial infarction, stroke, serotonin syndrome, and peripheral vascular ischemia require urgent medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to almotriptan.
- Ischemic heart disease (angina, history of myocardial infarction, silent ischemia).

- Hemiplegic or basilar migraine.
- Use within 24 hours of another 5-HT<sub>1</sub> agonist (another triptan) or ergot-type medication (dihydroergotamine, ergotamine).

## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP3A4 Inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole):** Increased almotriptan levels, necessitating dosage reduction.
- **Ergot-containing medications (e.g., ergotamine, dihydroergotamine):** Additive vasoconstrictive effects; avoid concomitant use or use within 24 hours of each other.
- **Other 5-HT<sub>1</sub> agonists (triptans):** Additive effects; avoid concomitant use within 24 hours.
- **Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs):** Increased risk of serotonin syndrome; avoid concomitant use or use within 2 weeks of discontinuing MAOIs.
- **Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs):** Increased risk of serotonin syndrome; monitor closely.
- St. John's Wort may decrease almotriptan efficacy.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Limited data available. Almotriptan may cause fetal harm. Use only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Advise patients to use effective contraception during treatment. 

- **Breastfeeding:**  Limited data available; caution advised. Almotriptan is present in breast milk. Consider avoiding breastfeeding for 24 hours after taking almotriptan or using an alternative medication. Discuss risks and benefits with the patient.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptor agonist, leading to cranial vasoconstriction and inhibition of trigeminal nerve activation.
- **Side Effects:** Common:  Dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, paresthesia. Serious: Allergic reactions, chest pain, myocardial infarction, stroke.
- **Contraindications:** Cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, concomitant use with ergot-containing medications or other triptans.
