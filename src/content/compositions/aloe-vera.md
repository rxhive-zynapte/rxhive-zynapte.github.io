## **Usage**

- Aloe vera is primarily used topically for minor burns, wounds, frostbite, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, and other skin conditions. Orally, it is sometimes used for constipation, diabetes, and other conditions, but strong scientific evidence is lacking for these uses.  It should not be used for severe burns or deep open wounds.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Topical aloe can be classified as a demulcent, emollient, vulnerary (wound healer), and anti-inflammatory agent. Oral aloe (latex) acts as a stimulant laxative.
- **Mechanism of Action (Topical):**  Promotes wound healing by improving blood circulation to the affected area, stimulating fibroblast activity and collagen synthesis, and possibly inhibiting certain bacteria and fungi.
- **Mechanism of Action (Oral - Latex):** Contains anthraquinones that increase intestinal motility and water content in the stool, leading to a laxative effect.

## **Alternate Names**

- _Aloe barbadensis_ Miller, _Aloe vera_ (L.) Burm.f.
- **Brand Names:** Numerous brand names exist for aloe vera products, varying by manufacturer and formulation.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics (Topical):** Reduces inflammation, promotes cell regeneration, and possibly exhibits antimicrobial properties.
- **Pharmacokinetics (Topical):** Primarily localized to the application site with limited systemic absorption.
- **Pharmacodynamics (Oral - Latex):** Stimulates bowel movements by increasing peristalsis.
- **Pharmacokinetics (Oral - Latex):** Anthraquinones are metabolized by intestinal bacteria. Elimination pathways are not fully elucidated but likely involve both renal and hepatic excretion.
- **Mode of Action:**  The exact mechanisms of action for many of aloe vera's purported effects are not fully understood. Several compounds like carboxypeptidase, salicylates, and magnesium lactate may contribute to its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties through the inhibition of bradykinin and histamine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (Topical):** Apply gel to the affected area 3-5 times daily as needed.

#### **Adults (Oral - Gel):**  Limited data exists for oral use of aloe gel. Some studies used doses of 50-200 mg/day in capsule form or 30 mL of liquid three times daily. However, consistent dosing guidelines are lacking.

#### **Children (Topical):** Aloe gel can be applied topically to children. However, oral ingestion of aloe latex or whole-leaf extracts is not recommended for children under 12 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution, especially for oral administration, due to the potential for drug interactions and adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Oral use of aloe, especially aloe latex, should be avoided or used with extreme caution due to the risk of kidney damage.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution due to potential liver toxicity with long-term oral use.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Patients with diabetes, gastrointestinal disorders (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, intestinal obstruction), and hemorrhoids should avoid oral aloe, particularly aloe latex.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Aloe vera is generally not indicated for use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific dosage adjustments are established for clinical use cases since aloe vera is not typically employed in such settings.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects (Topical):**  Minor skin irritation, itching, redness, or allergic reactions.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects (Oral):**  Abdominal pain, cramps, diarrhea, electrolyte imbalance, kidney damage (with high doses of aloe latex), and potential liver toxicity with chronic use.

### **Long-Term Effects (Oral):** Potential for chronic kidney and liver problems with prolonged high-dose use of aloe latex.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** Acute kidney failure can occur with ingestion of large amounts of aloe latex.

## **Contraindications**

- Pregnancy and breastfeeding (oral use)
- Children under 12 years of age (oral use)
- Hypersensitivity to aloe or plants in the Liliaceae family
- Intestinal conditions (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, intestinal obstruction)
- Hemorrhoids
- Severe dehydration
- Kidney disease

## **Drug Interactions**

- **Antidiabetic medications:** Aloe may lower blood sugar levels, potentially leading to hypoglycemia when combined with antidiabetic drugs.
- **Anticoagulants/Antiplatelet drugs:** Aloe may enhance the effects of these drugs, increasing the risk of bleeding.
- **Digoxin:** Aloe may decrease potassium levels, potentially increasing the risk of digoxin toxicity.
- **Diuretics:** Aloe's laxative effect can further deplete electrolytes, especially potassium, which can be exacerbated by diuretics.
- **Stimulant laxatives:** Combining aloe latex with other stimulant laxatives can lead to excessive bowel movements and electrolyte imbalances.
- **Warfarin:** Aloe may affect blood clotting and interact with warfarin.
- **Sevoflurane:** Aloe may affect blood glucose control during and after surgery.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Not established. Oral use of aloe, especially aloe latex, is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of uterine contractions and miscarriage.
- **Breastfeeding:** Oral use of aloe is contraindicated while breastfeeding as it may cause diarrhea and other side effects in infants.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Topical: Anti-inflammatory, wound healing. Oral (latex): Stimulant laxative.
- **Side Effects:** Topical: Minor skin irritation. Oral: Abdominal pain, cramps, diarrhea, electrolyte imbalances, kidney and liver damage (high doses or chronic use).
- **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, breastfeeding, children under 12 (oral use), intestinal conditions, kidney disease.
- **Drug Interactions:** Antidiabetic medications, anticoagulants, digoxin, diuretics, stimulant laxatives, warfarin.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated (oral use).
