## **Usage**

Alpha-galactosidase is prescribed for the treatment of Fabry disease, a rare genetic disorder.  It is also used as an over-the-counter dietary supplement to improve digestion and reduce gas, bloating, flatulence, and stomach pain associated with the consumption of foods containing complex carbohydrates such as legumes, grains, and certain vegetables.  Pharmacologically, alpha-galactosidase is classified as a digestive enzyme. For Fabry disease, it is considered an enzyme replacement therapy. The drug works by breaking down specific complex sugars (oligosaccharides), particularly globotriaosylceramide (GL-3), that accumulate in the body due to the deficiency or malfunctioning of the alpha-galactosidase A enzyme in individuals with Fabry disease.  As a digestive aid, alpha-galactosidase hydrolyzes oligosaccharides present in food, preventing their fermentation by intestinal bacteria and thus reducing gas production.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely used alternate names for alpha-galactosidase. Some sources refer to it as alpha-D-galactosidase or alpha-GAL.  Brand names for alpha-galactosidase as a digestive supplement include Beano, Gas-X Prevention, BeanAssist, and Fibractase forte. For treatment of Fabry disease, examples include Replagal (agalsidase alfa), Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta), and Galafold (migalastat), although Galafold functions as a pharmacological chaperone rather than a direct enzyme replacement.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** In Fabry disease, alpha-galactosidase replaces the deficient enzyme, enabling the breakdown of GL-3 accumulated in various tissues, including blood vessels, kidneys, heart, and nervous system.  This reduces the associated symptoms and progression of the disease. As a digestive enzyme, alpha-galactosidase acts locally in the gastrointestinal tract, breaking down complex carbohydrates before they can be fermented by gut bacteria.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  As a digestive aid, it is taken orally just before meals.  The enzyme acts locally within the digestive tract and is not absorbed systematically, meaning it is unlikely to cause systemic effects and drug interactions. For Fabry disease, the drug is administered intravenously. The enzyme is taken up by cells via endocytosis. The peak plasma concentration is reached within a few hours after infusion. As of today (2025-02-16) accurate information is not available on the metabolism and excretion routes.

**Mode of Action:** Alpha-galactosidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of terminal alpha-galactosyl moieties from glycolipids and glycoproteins, which includes GL-3.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Alpha-galactosidase functions as an enzyme replacement, not by receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation.  It replaces or stabilizes the activity of the deficient alpha-galactosidase A enzyme.

**Elimination Pathways:** For Fabry disease, the enzyme is distributed to various tissues, including the kidneys. Currently, the exact elimination pathways remain unclear. Further research is needed to fully understand the pharmacokinetics of enzyme replacement therapy for Fabry disease.  For digestive enzyme supplements, elimination is through faeces, along with undigested food.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Digestive enzyme supplement:**  1-3 capsules or 5 drops per serving of problematic food right before the first bite, generally with meals.  Maximum dose: Not to exceed 15 capsules per day. 
* **Fabry disease (Replagal):** 0.2 mg/kg intravenously every other week.
* **Fabry disease (Fabrazyme):** 1 mg/kg intravenously every other week.
* **Fabry disease (Galafold):** 123 mg orally every other day on an empty stomach.

#### **Children:**

* **Digestive enzyme supplement:** Consult a healthcare provider before administering the drug to children under 2 years old.  Age-appropriate dosages are typically recommended from 2 years of age by the manufacturer.  Dosage may vary based on the specific product and the child's age and weight. 
* **Fabry disease:** Consult a healthcare provider as dosing will depend on the severity of the patient's condition and the specific medicine used.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** As of today (2025-02-16), no specific dosage adjustments are available for elderly patients, but careful monitoring is advisable. Clinical experience is limited for elderly patients. It is essential to assess renal and hepatic function in elderly patients before initiating therapy and to adjust the dose accordingly if necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** For Fabry disease, dosage adjustments for renal impairment is not generally recommended for Replagal and Fabrazyme. However, careful monitoring of renal function is crucial during treatment. For Galafold, specific dosage adjustments based on the severity of renal impairment may be required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments for hepatic impairment. Further research is needed to evaluate the impact of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of alpha-galactosidase and determine appropriate dosage adjustments for these patient populations.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution should be exercised in patients with diabetes, as digestive enzymes may affect blood sugar levels. Close monitoring is needed for dose adjustments.  Alpha-galactosidase may interact with certain medications. Patients with comorbid conditions, particularly those on multiple medications, should inform their healthcare providers about all the medicines they are taking.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Alpha-galactosidase is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary use is in managing Fabry disease and as a digestive enzyme supplement.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, other comorbid conditions, and interactions with other medications.  Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism should be considered.

## **Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, gas, heartburn.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects** (Fabry disease treatment)

Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), fever, headache, infusion-related reactions, hypersensitivity.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Limited data are available on the long-term effects of alpha-galactosidase use. Continued monitoring is essential for patients receiving long-term treatment for Fabry disease.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Anaphylaxis (rare), hypersensitivity reactions (including rash, hives, itching, swelling, and difficulty breathing).

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to alpha-galactosidase or any component of the formulation.  Alpha-gal syndrome is a contraindication for digestive enzyme supplements containing alpha-galactosidase.  Acute pancreatitis.

## **Drug Interactions**

As a digestive enzyme supplement, alpha-galactosidase can interact with acarbose and miglitol.

For Fabry disease treatment, consult a specialist as interactions can be complex and drug specific. Example, Galafold may interact with amiodarone, chloroquine, gentamicin, and monobenzone. Other treatments can interact with other medications such as levothyroxine.

Food and lifestyle factors: Avoid alcohol while taking this medicine as it can worsen bloating.  No significant interactions with food are known for the digestive enzyme supplement.  However, for the treatment of Fabry disease, it's recommended to avoid food at least 2 hours before and after administering Galafold. Consult a specialist for other treatments regarding food-drug interactions.
