## **Usage**

- Alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine (Alpha-GPC) is primarily prescribed to improve cognitive function in conditions like Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and stroke. It may also be used to enhance memory, thinking skills, and learning.  In Europe, it's a prescription medication for Alzheimer's disease. In the US, it's available as a dietary supplement.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Nootropic, cholinergic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Alpha-GPC acts as a precursor to acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter vital for memory, learning, and other cognitive functions. It elevates acetylcholine levels in the brain, thereby potentially improving cognitive performance.

## **Alternate Names**

- Alfa-GPC, Alpha Glycerol Phosphoryl Choline, Alpha-Glyceryl Phosphoryl Choline, Alpha-Glyceryl Phosphatidylcholine, Choline alphoscerate, Glycerophosphorylcholine, Glycérophosphorylcholine, GPC, GroPCho, L-A-Glyceryl Phosphorylcholine, L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine.
- **Brand Names:** AlphaSize, Delecit (prescription-only, not available in the US).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Alpha-GPC increases acetylcholine levels in the brain, leading to potential improvements in cognitive function, including memory, attention, and learning. It may also have neuroprotective effects.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Alpha-GPC is readily absorbed orally and crosses the blood-brain barrier, delivering choline to the brain. It is metabolized to choline and glycerophosphate. Elimination pathways are not fully elucidated but likely involve both renal and hepatic routes.
- **Mode of Action:** Alpha-GPC serves as a choline donor for acetylcholine synthesis. It may also influence membrane fluidity and neuronal plasticity.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Primarily modulates cholinergic neurotransmission by increasing acetylcholine availability. Information on specific receptor binding or enzyme inhibition is limited.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- For cognitive decline: 1200 mg/day, divided into three doses of 400 mg.
- For enhancing power output: 300-600 mg, 30-60 minutes before exercise.

#### **Children:**

- Limited data is available. Consult a pediatrician for guidance.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Standard adult dose, but careful monitoring is recommended.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary. Consult a nephrologist.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution advised for patients with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and other conditions. Individualized dosing may be required.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not well-established. Consult specialist literature or expert opinion.


### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dose modifications are necessary for patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction. Specific guidelines based on clearance rates or liver function tests are not available.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Heartburn, headache, insomnia, dizziness, skin rash, confusion, nausea, diarrhea, stomach upset, nervousness.

- Antimuscarinics, thyroxine, anticoagulants (warfarin, acenocoumarol), pain killers (aspirin): Potential interactions, although not fully characterized.
- Alcohol: May increase dizziness.
- Other choline supplements: Avoid taking on the same day due to the risk of excessive choline intake.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Insufficient data available. AlphaSize is the only approved Alpha-GPC source for pregnant and breastfeeding women. Consult a doctor before use.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Precursor to acetylcholine, enhances cholinergic neurotransmission.
