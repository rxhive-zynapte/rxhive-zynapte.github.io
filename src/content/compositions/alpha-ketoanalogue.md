## **Usage**

- Alpha Ketoanalogue is prescribed for the dietary management of chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly in patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 25 mL/min, in conjunction with a protein-restricted diet (typically 40g/day for adults). It is also used to slow the progression of kidney failure in diabetic nephropathy.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Nutritional supplement.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Alpha ketoanalogues are nitrogen-free analogues of essential amino acids.  In CKD, the body has difficulty processing nitrogen from protein. These ketoanalogues are metabolized into essential amino acids without adding to the nitrogen load, thereby reducing the buildup of uremic toxins and preserving kidney function while also preventing muscle wasting due to protein restriction.

## **Alternate Names**

- Ketoanalogues, keto acid analogues.
- Brand names include Ketorena, Ketrenal, Alfa Add, Alpha Crez, Eulog, Ketocheck, Nefrogem Keto, NephroRick, RenalKet, Renolog, Renolog DS.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Alpha ketoanalogues reduce nitrogen load, decrease urea levels, help to maintain nutritional balance in patients with CKD and slow down the progression of the disease.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Alpha ketoanalogues are absorbed rapidly in the gastrointestinal tract. They undergo transamination in the liver, where they are converted into their corresponding essential amino acids. The elimination pathways have not been specifically studied, but they are believed to follow the same catabolic pathways as the naturally occurring amino acids.
- **Mode of Action:** Alpha ketoanalogues are transaminated to the corresponding essential amino acids, using nitrogen from non-essential amino acids, thus reducing the nitrogen load on the kidneys.
- Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation do not appear to be involved in the mode of action.
- Elimination pathways are believed to be the same as their corresponding essential amino acids but are not well-characterized.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 4-8 tablets three times daily with meals (for a 70 kg adult).  This equates to approximately 1 tablet/5 kg body weight/day.

#### **Children:**

- There is no established dosing for children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be needed based on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose is based on GFR and protein intake restrictions.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advised; dosage adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Individualized dosing based on overall clinical picture is recommended.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage adjustments are based on renal function and protein intake restrictions rather than specific clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjust dosage based on GFR, protein intake, and serum calcium levels.
- Consider modifying dosage in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypercalcemia
- Disturbed amino acid metabolism

## **Drug Interactions**

- Calcium-containing drugs may increase serum calcium levels.
- Drugs forming insoluble compounds with calcium (tetracyclines, quinolones like ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, iron-, fluoride-, or estramustine-containing drugs) should be avoided.
- Aluminum hydroxide-containing antacids should be avoided.
- Alcohol should be avoided due to the potential for unpleasant side effects.
