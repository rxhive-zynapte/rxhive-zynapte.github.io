## **Usage**

Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is prescribed for diabetic neuropathy, a type of nerve damage that can occur in individuals with diabetes.  It's also used to improve insulin sensitivity in individuals with type 2 diabetes and may offer benefits in managing symptoms associated with various conditions, including burning mouth syndrome, liver disease, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It acts as both an antioxidant and a metabolic cofactor.

## **Alternate Names**

- Thioctic acid
- 1,2-Dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid
- ALA


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** ALA functions as a potent antioxidant, both directly and indirectly. It regenerates other antioxidants like vitamin C and vitamin E and increases intracellular glutathione levels. It also chelates metal ions, preventing oxidative stress.  In diabetic neuropathy, ALA improves nerve conduction velocity and reduces neuropathic pain. For type 2 diabetes, it enhances glucose uptake and improves insulin sensitivity.

**Pharmacokinetics:** ALA is readily absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 30-60 minutes. It is metabolized in the liver through various pathways, including oxidation and conjugation.  It's eliminated primarily through renal excretion.

**Mode of Action:** ALA acts as a cofactor for mitochondrial enzyme complexes involved in energy production. It participates in the Krebs cycle, facilitating glucose metabolism and ATP synthesis. Its antioxidant properties protect nerve cells from oxidative damage.  It does not appear to bind to specific receptors but modulates various intracellular signaling pathways.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Diabetic Neuropathy: 600-1800 mg/day orally, often divided into three equal doses. Intravenous administration (600mg/day) may be used in some cases.
- Other Conditions: 200-2400 mg/day, divided into doses.

#### **Children:**

- Limited data available.  Doses of up to 600 mg/day have been used in children aged 10-17 for up to 3 months, but safety in younger children has not been established.  Administer with caution under strict medical supervision.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start at the lower end of the dosing range and monitor closely.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Adjust dose based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution and monitor closely, as ALA is metabolized in the liver.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring of blood glucose is essential in patients with diabetes.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations:**  Dosage is generally based on individual patient needs and clinical judgment. IV administration may be preferred in acute settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments:** Dose adjustments may be necessary based on patient response, renal/hepatic function, and concomitant medications.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

- Headache, Nausea, Vomiting, Dizziness, Skin rash (primarily with topical application).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Hypoglycemia (particularly in those taking diabetes medications), Allergic reactions (rare).

### **Long-Term Effects:** Unknown.  Most studies have examined use for up to 4 years.


## **Contraindications**

- Known hypersensitivity to ALA, Thiamine deficiency, Severe liver disease, Excessive alcohol consumption.  Use with caution in pregnancy and breastfeeding.

## **Drug Interactions**

- **Diabetes Medications:** ALA can enhance the effects of insulin and other blood sugar-lowering agents, increasing the risk of hypoglycemia.
- **Chemotherapy Medications:** Potential for interference with certain chemotherapy agents.
- **Thyroid Medications:** May decrease thyroid hormone levels.
- **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol consumption while taking ALA, as it can increase the risk of thiamine deficiency.
- **Anticoagulant/Antiplatelet Drugs:** May increase bleeding risk.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** ALA is considered possibly safe during pregnancy when taken orally in doses up to 600 mg daily for up to 4 weeks. Data on long-term use are limited.
- **Breastfeeding:** Safety during breastfeeding is unknown. Avoid use.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Antioxidant, metabolic cofactor.
- **Side Effects:** Headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, skin rash, hypoglycemia (rarely).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, thiamine deficiency, severe liver disease, excessive alcohol use.
- **Drug Interactions:** Diabetes medications, chemotherapy agents, thyroid medications, alcohol.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution during pregnancy. Avoid use during breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** 600-1800 mg/day for diabetic neuropathy.  Adjust based on individual needs and conditions.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood glucose levels (especially in diabetics), liver function tests.


## **Popular Combinations**

Often used in combination with other antioxidants (e.g., vitamins C and E).


## **Precautions**

- Monitor blood glucose in patients with diabetes.
- Assess for thiamine deficiency.
- Monitor liver function tests.
- Advise patients to avoid alcohol.
