## **Usage**

- Alum, in medical contexts, primarily refers to aluminum salts like aluminum sulfate, aluminum hydroxide, or potassium alum.  These salts are used to treat various conditions, including:
    - **Hyperhidrosis:**  Aluminum chloride is a primary active ingredient in many antiperspirants, reducing excessive sweating by blocking sweat ducts.
    - **Water purification:**  Aluminum sulfate is used as a coagulant in water treatment to remove impurities.
    - **Minor bleeding control:**  Alum can be applied topically to stop minor cuts from bleeding due to its astringent properties.
    - **Vaccine adjuvant:** Aluminum salts enhance the immune response to vaccines.
    - **Antacid (aluminum hydroxide):** Neutralizes stomach acid to relieve heartburn, acid indigestion, and upset stomach. 
    - **Treatment of bladder cancer:** Alum irrigation can be used to control hematuria (blood in the urine) in cases of inoperable bladder cancer, especially in patients with renal impairment where silver nitrate cannot be used.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**
    - Astringent
    - Antiperspirant
    - Coagulant
    - Antacid (aluminum hydroxide)

- **Mechanism of Action:**  The mechanism of action varies depending on the specific alum salt and its application.  Generally, alum acts through:
    - Astringent action:  Causes contraction of tissues, constricting blood vessels and reducing bleeding.
    - Blocking sweat ducts (aluminum chloride):  Forms a plug within the sweat duct, reducing sweat secretion.
    - Coagulation (aluminum sulfate): Neutralizes the electrical charge of suspended particles in water, causing them to clump together and settle out.
    - Neutralization of gastric acid (aluminum hydroxide):  Reacts with hydrochloric acid in the stomach to form aluminum chloride and water, thus raising gastric pH.



## **Alternate Names** 

- Aluminum sulfate (alum), potash alum (potassium alum), aluminum hydroxide, aluminum chloride


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**
    - **Aluminum hydroxide (antacid):**  Neutralizes gastric acid by increasing gastric pH.  This can lead to reduced pepsin activity.
    - **Aluminum chloride (antiperspirant):**  Precipitates proteins and forms plugs within sweat ducts, inhibiting sweat secretion.
    - **Aluminum sulfate (coagulant):**  Causes colloidal particles in water to aggregate and precipitate, aiding clarification.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Oral absorption of aluminum salts is generally poor.
    - **Metabolism:** Minimal metabolism of aluminum salts occurs.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion, with some aluminum potentially eliminated in feces.

- **Mode of Action:** Depends on the specific alum salt and its application (see above).

- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Not typically associated with these mechanisms, except for reduced pepsin activity by aluminum hydroxide due to increased gastric pH.

- **Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily renal excretion for most alum salts.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**  
#### **Adults:**  Aluminum hydroxide (antacid): 30-50ml every 3-4 hours, or 1 and 3 hours after meals and at bedtime.


#### **Children:** Aluminum hydroxide (antacid):  
    - Children: 5-15ml every 3-6 hours, or 1 and 3 hours after meals and at bedtime.
    - Infants: 1-2 ml/kg per dose, given after meals and at bedtime.


#### **Special Cases:**  
- **Elderly Patients, Patients with Renal Impairment, Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction, Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Use aluminum hydroxide with caution in these populations due to the risk of aluminum toxicity and other potential complications.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  
Dosage recommendations vary depending on the specific alum salt and application (e.g., water purification, hyperhidrosis treatment).  Dosage guidelines for aluminum hydroxide as an antacid are provided above.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**  
- Aluminum hydroxide: Constipation, nausea, diarrhea, headache.
- Aluminum chloride: Skin irritation, dryness, itching.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**  
- Aluminum toxicity (primarily in patients with renal impairment):  Encephalopathy, osteomalacia, hypophosphatemia.


## **Contraindications**
- Hypersensitivity to aluminum salts.
- Severe renal impairment (for aluminum-containing products).
- Concomitant use with pazopanib or raltegravir (aluminum hydroxide).



## **Drug Interactions**
Aluminum hydroxide can interact with numerous medications, including:
- Tetracycline antibiotics
- Quinolone antibiotics
- Iron supplements
- Digoxin
- Pazopanib
- Raltegravir


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Aluminum hydroxide should be used with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding, only if clearly needed.  Limited data are available regarding transfer to breast milk, but aluminum is present in human milk naturally.  Some authorities recommend monitoring breastfed infants for potential side effects.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Varies depending on the alum salt (see above).
- **Side Effects:** See above.
- **Contraindications:** See above.
- **Drug Interactions:** See above.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution.
- **Dosage:** Varies depending on the alum salt (see above).
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function (in patients with pre-existing renal disease).


## **Precautions**
- Pre-existing renal disease
- Dehydration
- Frequent alcohol consumption
