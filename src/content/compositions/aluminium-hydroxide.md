## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Aluminium hydroxide is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of heartburn, acid indigestion, sour stomach, and upset stomach associated with these symptoms. It is also used to manage hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. Topically, it can act as a skin protectant.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antacid, phosphate binder.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Aluminium hydroxide neutralizes hydrochloric acid in the stomach, raising gastric pH and inhibiting pepsin activity.  It also binds phosphate in the GI tract, preventing its absorption. Topically, it forms a protective barrier on the skin.

## **Alternate Names**

- Aluminum hydroxide (US spelling)
- Alu-Cap
- AlternaGEL
- Amphojel

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Aluminium hydroxide increases gastric pH, reducing pepsin activity and providing relief from acid-related symptoms. It binds dietary phosphate, reducing its absorption and thus lowering serum phosphate levels. 
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Orally administered aluminum hydroxide has limited absorption from the GI tract.  The absorbed portion is primarily excreted by the kidneys.  Most of the ingested aluminum hydroxide is eliminated in the feces as insoluble aluminum phosphate complexes.
- **Mode of Action:** Acts by chemical neutralization of gastric acid and by binding phosphate ions. No receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation is involved.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily eliminated through feces; a small absorbed portion is renally excreted.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Antacid:** 600-1200 mg (tablets) or 640 mg (oral suspension) 3-4 times daily, after meals and at bedtime, as needed. Maximum: 3840 mg/24 hours.
- **Hyperphosphatemia:** 600-1200 mg 3-4 times daily with meals.

#### **Children:**

- **Antacid:** 5-15 mL of oral suspension every 3-6 hours, or 1 and 3 hours after meals and at bedtime. (Safer alternatives are preferred.)
- **Hyperphosphatemia:** 50-150 mg/kg/day orally, divided every 4-6 hours. Titrate dose to maintain phosphorus within normal range.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lower end of the dosing range. Monitor for constipation and fecal impaction.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Aluminum toxicity may occur. Dosage adjustments are needed. Monitor serum aluminum levels.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor patients with heart failure, edema, or cirrhosis.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Specific dosage recommendations for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not explicitly defined for aluminum hydroxide.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose reductions are needed for patients with renal impairment.
- Monitor phosphate, calcium, and aluminum serum levels during long-term use, especially in patients with renal failure.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Constipation
- Nausea
- Chalky taste

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Aluminum toxicity (especially in renal impairment)
- Osteomalacia
- Hypophosphatemia
- Encephalopathy
- Seizures

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Osteoporosis (potential)

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Milk-alkali syndrome
- Fecal impaction
- Bowel obstruction
- Hypomagnesemia



## **Contraindications**

- Known hypersensitivity to aluminum hydroxide
- Severe renal impairment
- Hypophosphatemia
- Bowel obstruction



## **Drug Interactions**

- Aluminum hydroxide reduces the absorption of many medications, including tetracycline antibiotics, quinolone antibiotics (ciprofloxacin), digoxin, iron salts, levothyroxine, pazopanib, raltegravir, and others. Separate administration times as recommended.
- Antacids can affect the absorption of other drugs by altering gastric pH.




## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Aluminum hydroxide is generally considered safe during pregnancy when used as directed.  However, it is advisable to use it only when the benefits outweigh the potential risks.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Aluminum hydroxide is considered compatible with breastfeeding. Monitor infants for constipation.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Neutralizes gastric acid and binds phosphate.
- **Side Effects:** Constipation, nausea, aluminum toxicity (rare).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe renal impairment, hypophosphatemia.
- **Drug Interactions:** Reduces the absorption of many drugs.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally considered safe.
- **Dosage:**  Varies by indication and patient factors. See dosage section for details.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Phosphate, calcium, and aluminum levels (in renal patients).

## **Popular Combinations**

- Magnesium hydroxide: Commonly combined to counteract the constipating effects of aluminum hydroxide.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess renal function before and during prolonged use.
- **Specific Populations:**  Use cautiously in elderly patients and those with renal impairment.
- **Pregnant Women:** Use only when clearly needed.
- **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Monitor infant for constipation.
- **Children & Elderly:**  Monitor closely for side effects.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** No specific restrictions.
