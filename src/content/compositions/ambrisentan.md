## **Usage**

- Ambrisentan is prescribed for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group 1) to improve exercise capacity and delay clinical worsening. It's also used in combination with tadalafil for PAH to reduce the risks of disease progression and hospitalization, as well as to improve exercise ability.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Endothelin Receptor Antagonist (ERA).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Ambrisentan competitively binds to endothelin type A receptors, blocking the effects of endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor that plays a key role in the development of PAH. This receptor blockade leads to vasodilation and reduced pulmonary vascular resistance, ultimately improving blood flow and reducing strain on the heart.

## **Alternate Names**

- International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Ambrisentan
- Brand Name: Letairis (and generic versions)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ambrisentan lowers pulmonary arterial pressure and improves cardiac output by selectively inhibiting the endothelin A receptor, leading to pulmonary vasodilation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Absorption: Ambrisentan is readily absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in about 1 to 2 hours. Food does not significantly affect absorption.
    - Metabolism: Primarily metabolized in the liver via glucuronidation and oxidation by CYP3A4, with a minor contribution from CYP2C19.
    - Elimination: Excreted mainly in the bile and feces, with a small amount in urine. The elimination half-life is around 15 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Ambrisentan competitively antagonizes endothelin-1 at the endothelin type A receptor located on vascular smooth muscle cells. This antagonism prevents endothelin-1-mediated vasoconstriction, thereby promoting vasodilation in the pulmonary arteries.
- **Receptor Binding:** Selective for endothelin type A receptor.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism and biliary/fecal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial: 5 mg orally once daily.
- Maintenance:  May be increased to 10 mg orally once daily, as needed and tolerated, after 4 weeks.
- With Tadalafil: Initial: Ambrisentan 5 mg once daily and Tadalafil 20 mg once daily. Either drug may be uptitrated at 4-week intervals (Ambrisentan to max 10 mg and Tadalafil to max 40 mg daily) as needed and tolerated.


#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age due to limited safety and efficacy data.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is required. Caution is advised for severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min).
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
    - Mild impairment: Dose adjustment may be needed, but no specific guidelines. Caution recommended.
    - Moderate or severe impairment: Use is not recommended.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**
    - Concomitant cyclosporine A: Limit ambrisentan dose to 5 mg once daily.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Ambrisentan is specifically indicated for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Its use in other clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations is not established.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
