## **Usage**

Ambroxol is prescribed for respiratory diseases associated with viscous or excessive mucus. It is classified as a mucolytic and expectorant.  Ambroxol's mechanism of action involves:

* **Mucolytic Action:**  Reduces the viscosity of mucus by breaking down mucopolysaccharide fibers.
* **Expectorant Action:** Increases serous secretions in the bronchial glands, which helps thin the mucus and makes it easier to cough up. It also stimulates the ciliary activity of the respiratory epithelium, further aiding in mucus clearance.

## **Alternate Names**

Ambroxol hydrochloride is the chemical name. Brand names vary regionally but include Mucosolvan, Lasolvan, and Mucoangin.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ambroxol stimulates the serous cells of bronchial glands, increasing the production of watery mucus, which reduces the viscosity of existing phlegm. It demonstrates some local anesthetic properties that provide relief for a sore throat.  Ambroxol also has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that could offer benefits in respiratory conditions.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentration is reached in approximately 2 hours. Bioavailability is around 73% after oral administration.
* **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, mainly via glucuronidation. Bromhexine is a significant metabolite.
* **Elimination:** Excreted primarily in the urine, with a biphasic half-life of approximately 1-9 hours. The initial (alpha) phase is about 1.3 hours, and the terminal (beta) phase is about 8.8 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Ambroxol's mucolytic action is mainly due to the depolymerization of mucopolysaccharides, reducing sputum viscosity.  It also enhances the activity of surfactant, a substance that helps to keep the air sacs (alveoli) open.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** There's evidence suggesting sodium channel blocking activity in neurons by ambroxol, but the clinical relevance isn't fully understood.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily eliminated by renal excretion, with minimal hepatic excretion. 

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Standard oral dose: 30-120 mg daily, divided into 2-3 doses. Extended-release capsules: 75 mg once daily.  Lozenges (15 mg): Suck up to 6 lozenges daily (maximum 2 lozenges per dose).


#### **Children:**

* Below 6 months: 0.5 mL syrup every 12 hours
* 7-12 months: 1 mL syrup every 12 hours
* 1-2 years: 1.25 mL syrup every 12 hours.
* 2-5 years: Half a teaspoonful of syrup 2-3 times daily
* Over 5 years: One teaspoonful of syrup 2-3 times daily

Pediatric safety considerations: Carefully monitor children for potential gastrointestinal adverse effects. Adjust dosage as needed according to weight and age.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Initiate therapy at the lower end of the dosing range and adjust cautiously based on renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Monitor closely for adverse effects. Dose adjustments may be needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualize dosage based on specific conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Intubation:** Data suggests large doses of intravenous ambroxol might be beneficial in the perioperative setting, specifically in high-risk patients, to reduce pulmonary complications.
* **Surgical Procedures:** For patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease undergoing cardiac or upper abdominal surgery, perioperative ambroxol administration may reduce postoperative pulmonary complications. Studies have shown high doses (1000 mg/day for 3 days) to be beneficial.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:**  Large dose ambroxol has been investigated for reducing ventilator-associated pneumonia, particularly in the elderly.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Ambroxol has been explored in ICU settings for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but evidence regarding its efficacy is mixed. High-dose oral ambroxol (40 mg/kg/day in four divided doses) has been studied in ventilated pediatric ARDS patients, but results did not show significant improvements in outcomes. 
* **Emergency Situations:** There is no established use in emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Renal or hepatic impairment requires cautious dose adjustment.  Metabolic disorders and genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism necessitate careful consideration for dosage.  Patients with Gaucher's disease and myoclonic epilepsy have been given ambroxol with increased doses up to 30 mg/kg/day.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rash, itching, dizziness, weakness, dry mouth, indigestion, altered taste, throat and mouth numbness, upset stomach.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), including difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.

### **Long-Term Effects**

No long-term adverse effects have been consistently reported.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Anaphylaxis and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome are potential ADRs requiring immediate attention.


## **Contraindications**

Known hypersensitivity to ambroxol or bromhexine. Use cautiously in patients with gastric ulcers. First trimester of pregnancy.


## **Drug Interactions**

Ambroxol may interact with certain medications like antibiotics and some cough suppressants. Consider potential drug interactions when co-prescribing.  


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Ambroxol should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy.  Its use during the second and third trimesters requires careful consideration of potential risks and benefits.  Ambroxol may be present in breast milk; hence, its use during breastfeeding is not recommended.
