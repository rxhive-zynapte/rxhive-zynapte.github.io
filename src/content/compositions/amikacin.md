## **Usage**

Amikacin is prescribed for serious infections caused by susceptible strains of Gram-negative bacteria, including *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Escherichia coli*, *Proteus species*, *Klebsiella species*, *Enterobacter species*, *Serratia species*, and *Acinetobacter species*.  It is also effective against some Gram-positive bacteria, such as *Staphylococcus species*, and is occasionally used to treat multi-drug resistant tuberculosis when other treatments have failed.

It is classified as an aminoglycoside antibiotic.

Amikacin's mechanism of action involves irreversible binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, inhibiting protein synthesis and leading to bacterial cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

Amikacin Sulfate is the official chemical name.  There are numerous brand names worldwide, with Amikin being a previously popular brand name (now discontinued in some countries). Other brand names may be available regionally. 


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Amikacin exerts its bactericidal effect by irreversibly binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria. This binding interferes with protein synthesis by causing misreading of mRNA and ultimately leading to cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). Not absorbed orally. IM absorption is rapid.
* **Distribution:** Distributes widely into most body fluids and tissues, including pleural, peritoneal, and synovial fluids.  Limited penetration into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), but penetration increases with meningeal inflammation.
* **Metabolism:** Minimal metabolism.
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine by glomerular filtration. Elimination half-life is prolonged in patients with renal impairment.


**Mode of Action:** Amikacin targets the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, specifically the decoding site. This interference disrupts the accurate translation of mRNA, leading to the production of non-functional proteins and ultimately bacterial cell death.  The irreversible nature of the binding makes it particularly effective against susceptible bacteria. It does not undergo significant receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation other than its ribosomal binding action.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily excreted unchanged through renal excretion by glomerular filtration.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **IV/IM:** 15 mg/kg/day, given as a single daily dose or divided into 2-3 equal doses (e.g., 7.5 mg/kg every 12 hours or 5 mg/kg every 8 hours).  The total daily dose should not exceed 1.5 g.

#### **Children:**

* **IV/IM:** 15-20 mg/kg/day, as a single dose or in 2 divided doses. For neonates, dosing is adjusted based on gestational age and postnatal age (see below).

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Reduced doses or increased dosing intervals might be needed due to decreased creatinine clearance. Monitor serum creatinine levels closely.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage must be adjusted based on creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate (GFR).  Various dosing nomograms and calculators are available to guide appropriate dosing adjustments in renal impairment.  Therapeutic drug monitoring is crucial in these cases.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment is usually needed.  
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor closely for possible drug interactions. 


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations can vary depending on the specific infection and clinical setting.  Consult infectious disease specialists and pharmacists for optimal dosing strategies in specialized cases like severe sepsis, endocarditis, or febrile neutropenia. It is recommended to follow institution-specific guidelines or consult an infectious disease specialist for dosing in cases involving intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or other emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage needs to be adjusted in individuals with renal dysfunction. Use established guidelines or consult a nephrologist for guidance. Also, monitor patients for signs of toxicity. Adjust the dose based on patient response and serum drug levels.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, pain or irritation at the injection site.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* **Ototoxicity:** Hearing loss (including deafness), tinnitus, vertigo, balance issues.
* **Nephrotoxicity:** Kidney damage, decreased urine output.
* **Neuromuscular Blockade:** Muscle weakness, respiratory paralysis.


### **Long-Term Effects:**  Prolonged use can increase the risk of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** Anaphylaxis (rare), severe allergic reactions, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (very rare).



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to amikacin or other aminoglycosides. Pre-existing hearing loss, vestibular dysfunction, or severe renal impairment. Myasthenia gravis.


## **Drug Interactions**

Amikacin interacts with several other drugs, potentially increasing toxicity or decreasing efficacy. Notable interactions include:

* **Other nephrotoxic or ototoxic drugs:** (e.g., other aminoglycosides, vancomycin, amphotericin B, loop diuretics). Increased risk of kidney damage and hearing loss.
* **Neuromuscular blocking agents:** Enhanced neuromuscular blockade, potentially leading to respiratory paralysis.
* **Cephalosporins:** Increased nephrotoxicity.
* **NSAIDs:** Increased amikacin levels and toxicity.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Amikacin is categorized as Pregnancy Category D. It can cross the placenta and cause fetal harm, including ototoxicity. Use only if the potential benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus. It is unknown if amikacin passes into breast milk.  Caution is advised during breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, neuromuscular blockade.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to aminoglycosides, myasthenia gravis.
* **Drug Interactions:** Other aminoglycosides, vancomycin, loop diuretics, neuromuscular blocking agents.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category D; use with caution.
* **Dosage:** Adult: 15mg/kg/day, divided into 2-3 doses.  Pediatric: 15-20mg/kg/day. Adjustments required for renal dysfunction.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Serum creatinine, BUN, peak and trough drug levels, audiometry, vestibular testing.

## **Popular Combinations**

Amikacin may be used in combination with other antibiotics, such as beta-lactams or penicillins, for synergistic effects against specific infections like *Pseudomonas aeruginosa.*  Specific combination regimens should be determined based on local antibiograms and infectious disease expertise.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess renal function before and during treatment. Monitor for signs of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.
* **Specific Populations:** See "Dosage" section for adjustments for renal impairment and older adults. Close monitoring of renal function and drug levels during pregnancy is crucial, if use is unavoidable. Exercise caution during breastfeeding.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Alcohol may potentiate nephrotoxicity.
