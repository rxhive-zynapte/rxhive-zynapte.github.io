## **Usage**

- Amineptine was prescribed for major depressive disorder, particularly in cases of endogenous origin (depression stemming from internal factors rather than external stressors).
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) with unique properties distinguishing it from typical TCAs.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Primarily enhances dopamine reuptake inhibition and, to a lesser extent, norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, resulting in increased dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the synaptic cleft. This distinguishes it from most TCAs, which mainly target serotonin reuptake. It also acts on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, possibly contributing to its antidepressant effects.

## **Alternate Names**

- International Nonproprietary Name (INN):  Amineptine
- Other names: 7-[(10,11-Dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5-yl)amino]heptanoic acid;  S 1694
- **Brand Name:** Survector (withdrawn from market)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Amineptine primarily inhibits dopamine reuptake, leading to increased dopamine concentrations in the synaptic cleft, which is believed to be the primary mechanism responsible for its antidepressant effect. It has a weaker effect on norepinephrine reuptake inhibition.  Unlike typical TCAs, it has minimal effects on serotonin, histamine, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, resulting in a different side effect profile.  It also appears to influence the HPA axis, which is often dysregulated in depression.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Amineptine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations are reached approximately 1 to 1.5 hours after ingestion. It has a large volume of distribution, indicating extensive tissue penetration. The half-life of the parent drug is short (around 0.8 hours), while its active metabolite has a longer half-life (around 2.5 hours). The drug is metabolized extensively in the liver, primarily by demethylation and glucuronidation.  Elimination is rapid, mostly through renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** At the cellular level, amineptine binds to the dopamine transporter, blocking the reuptake of dopamine into the presynaptic neuron, resulting in increased dopamine levels in the synapse.  A similar, but weaker, effect is seen at the norepinephrine transporter.  Its modulation of the HPA axis could also involve the regulation of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH).
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**  Primarily targets dopamine transporter and, to a lesser extent, the norepinephrine transporter. Minimal binding at serotonin, adrenergic, histamine, and muscarinic receptors.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Hepatic metabolism is the main route of elimination, followed by renal excretion of metabolites.

## **Dosage**

Amineptine is no longer available on the market and the following information is for historical reference only.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: 100 mg/day, usually divided into two doses (morning and midday).
- Maintenance dose: Can be increased to 200 mg/day based on individual response and tolerability.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for use in children under 15 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is typically required, though caution is advised due to increased risk of side effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Close monitoring and possible dosage reduction are recommended.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with cardiovascular disease, seizure disorders, hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, history of mania or psychosis, narrow-angle glaucoma, or urinary retention.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Amineptine is not used in these clinical settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be required based on individual patient factors, such as renal/hepatic dysfunction, drug interactions, and tolerance.
