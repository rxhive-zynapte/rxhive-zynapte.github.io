      Can children take Aminobenzoic Acid?**


      **A:** Yes, but the dosage needs careful adjustment based on body weight
      (220 mg/kg/day divided into 4-6 doses for Peyronie's Disease). Doses above
      this level can be dangerous, even fatal.  Topical sunscreen use should

## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is FDA-approved for treating Peyronie's disease (a condition causing curved, painful erections) and for use as a sunscreen to prevent sunburn. It has historically been used for scleroderma (hardening of skin and connective tissues), but its efficacy for this purpose is not well-established.  It has also been used to treat vitiligo but with limited evidence.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Sunscreen agent, antifibrotic agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  The exact mechanism of action in Peyronie's disease is unclear, but it is thought to involve antifibrotic properties, potentially by increasing oxygen uptake in tissues. As a sunscreen, PABA absorbs ultraviolet radiation, preventing it from reaching and damaging the skin.

## **Alternate Names**

- Para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)
- Vitamin B10 (outdated classification)
- Brand names: Potaba (potassium salt formulation)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** In Peyronie's disease, PABA is thought to exert antifibrotic effects, potentially by increasing tissue oxygenation.  As a sunscreen, it absorbs UVB radiation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Absorption: Absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally.  Absorption through the skin is minimal when used as a sunscreen.
    - Metabolism:  Metabolized in the liver.
    - Elimination: Primarily excreted in the urine.
- **Mode of Action:** Not fully elucidated for Peyronie's disease.  UVB absorption in sunscreen use.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, neurotransmitter modulation:** Specific interactions not well-characterized.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Peyronie's Disease:** 12 grams per day orally, divided into four to six doses with meals or snacks.
- **Sunscreen:** Apply liberally to exposed skin 30 minutes before sun exposure. Reapply every two hours, or after swimming or sweating.

#### **Children:**

- **Peyronie's Disease:** 220 mg/kg of body weight per day orally, divided into four to six doses with meals or snacks.  Pediatric doses above this level can be unsafe, even fatal. 
- **Sunscreen:**  Apply as directed on product labeling.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary based on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be needed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment may be required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with kidney disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

PABA is not typically used for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its primary clinical uses are for Peyronie's disease and as a sunscreen.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Adjustments should be made for renal or hepatic impairment.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Upset stomach
- Anorexia
- Rash (especially with topical use)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Liver toxicity (with high doses)
- Kidney damage (with high doses)
- Blood disorders (with high doses)
- Allergic reactions (including hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, anaphylaxis)
- Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic complications from prolonged use are not well-studied.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, liver or kidney damage require immediate medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to PABA or any component of the formulation.
- Sulfonamide antibiotic use (PABA antagonizes their effects).
- Dapsone use (PABA may reduce its effectiveness).
- Severe kidney disease.

## **Drug Interactions**

- **Sulfonamide antibiotics:** PABA reduces their effectiveness.
- **Dapsone:** PABA may decrease its efficacy.
- **Medications affecting liver enzymes:** Potential for altered metabolism of both drugs.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Not formally categorized.  Limited data available.  Generally avoid oral use during pregnancy. Topical use on the skin is likely safe.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Unknown if excreted in breast milk.  Exercise caution.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Antifibrotic (Peyronie's), UVB absorption (sunscreen).
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, rash, liver/kidney toxicity (high doses), allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, sulfonamide use, dapsone use, severe kidney disease.
- **Drug Interactions:** Sulfonamides, dapsone, liver enzyme-altering drugs.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Limited safety data; avoid oral use in pregnancy.
- **Dosage:**  Peyronie's: Adults 12g/day divided, Children 220mg/kg/day divided. Sunscreen: apply liberally.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Liver function tests (with high-dose oral PABA).

## **Popular Combinations**

PABA is not typically used in combination therapies for Peyronie's disease. It may be included in multivitamin supplements.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Assess for allergies, renal function.
- **Specific Populations:** Avoid oral PABA in pregnancy, exercise caution during breastfeeding.  Carefully consider dosage in children and elderly patients.
