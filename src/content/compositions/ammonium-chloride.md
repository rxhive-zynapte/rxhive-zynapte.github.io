## **Usage**

- Ammonium chloride is prescribed for the treatment of metabolic alkalosis (a condition characterized by elevated blood pH) and hypochloremia (low chloride levels in the blood).  It can also be used as an expectorant to thin and loosen mucus in the airways.  Additionally, it is sometimes used to acidify urine, which can help prevent certain types of kidney stones or increase the effectiveness of some medications.
- **Pharmacological Classifications:** Systemic acidifying agent, urinary acidifying agent, expectorant.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Ammonium chloride is metabolized in the liver to urea and HCl, which leads to an increase in free hydrogen ions. These hydrogen ions react with bicarbonate, decreasing bicarbonate levels and lowering blood pH, thereby correcting alkalosis. The chloride ions help restore chloride balance in hypochloremia. As an expectorant, it acts by irritating the respiratory mucosa, stimulating mucus production and making it easier to cough up.

## **Alternate Names**

- Sal ammoniac,  Ammon Chloride.
- Brand names vary depending on the region and manufacturer.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ammonium chloride acidifies the blood and urine. As an expectorant, it increases respiratory tract fluid, thins mucus, and promotes expectoration.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Administered intravenously or orally. Orally administered ammonium chloride is absorbed readily from the GI tract within 5-6 hours of ingestion. The ammonium ion is metabolized in the liver to urea with resulting liberation of hydrogen ions and chloride ions into the extracellular fluid. These hydrogen ions react with bicarbonate, and the chloride ions increase chloride levels. Excreted by the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:**
    - In metabolic alkalosis, the metabolism of ammonium ions to urea releases hydrogen ions, which lower blood pH.
    - The increased chloride concentration directly addresses hypochloremia.
    - As an expectorant, it irritates the bronchial mucosa, promoting secretions and thinning mucus.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Oral:** As an expectorant, 300-600 mg every 2-4 hours. For metabolic alkalosis, the dose is variable and depends on the severity of the condition and the patient's clinical status, refer to local guidelines.
- **Intravenous:** 100-200 mEq diluted in 500-1000 mL of 0.9% NaCl. Infuse at a rate not exceeding 5 mL/minute.

#### **Children:**

- Dosage should be individualized based on the child's weight and the condition being treated.  Refer to local treatment protocol and guidelines.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to potential for decreased renal and hepatic function. Adjust dose as needed based on patientâ€™s clinical condition.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Contraindicated in severe renal impairment. Use with caution in mild to moderate renal impairment, adjusting the dose as per renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in severe hepatic dysfunction.  Use cautiously in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor closely and adjust dosage as needed based on clinical conditions such as cardiac, pulmonary, or other metabolic disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Specific dosage guidelines for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, and ICU use are not found in the provided resources. Please refer to local guidelines and protocols.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments may be required based on patient-specific factors such as renal/hepatic function, coexisting medical conditions, and clinical response. Serum bicarbonate levels should be monitored during intravenous administration.

## **Side Effects**
