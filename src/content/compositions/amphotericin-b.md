## **Usage**

Amphotericin B is prescribed for the treatment of progressive, potentially life-threatening invasive fungal infections.  It is particularly effective against a broad spectrum of fungi including *Aspergillus*, *Candida*, *Cryptococcus*, *Coccidioides*, *Histoplasma*, *Mucor*, and *Rhizopus*.  It is also used in the treatment of leishmaniasis.

Amphotericin B is classified as an **antifungal** agent, specifically a polyene antifungal.

Its mechanism of action involves binding to ergosterol, a key component of fungal cell membranes. This binding disrupts membrane integrity, leading to increased permeability and ultimately fungal cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Amphotericin B" is the universally recognized generic name, various formulations exist including:

* **Conventional Amphotericin B:** Amphotericin B deoxycholate
* **Lipid formulations:**  Liposomal amphotericin B, Amphotericin B lipid complex, Amphotericin B cholesteryl sulfate complex

Brand names include:

* **Fungizone** (conventional)
* **AmBisome** (liposomal)
* **Abelcet** (lipid complex)
* **Amphotec** (cholesteryl sulfate complex)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Amphotericin B primarily exerts its antifungal effect by binding to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane.  This interaction creates pores, increasing membrane permeability and causing leakage of intracellular contents, leading to cell death. Some binding to cholesterol in human cell membranes also occurs, accounting for some of its toxicity.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  Administered intravenously for systemic infections.
* **Distribution:**  Concentrates in liver, spleen, and kidney.  Limited penetration into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), necessitating intrathecal administration for some CNS infections.
* **Metabolism:**  Partially metabolized, but the exact metabolic pathways are not fully elucidated.
* **Elimination:**  Primarily renal excretion, with a prolonged terminal half-life. Lipid formulations exhibit altered pharmacokinetics with higher tissue concentrations and slower clearance.


**Mode of Action:** Binds to ergosterol in fungal cell membranes, disrupting membrane integrity and function.  It forms pores that increase permeability, leading to cell death.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** The primary mechanism is ergosterol binding. No significant interaction with human receptors, enzymes, or neurotransmitters.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion, with minimal hepatic metabolism.  Lipid formulations have reduced renal clearance compared to conventional amphotericin B.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Conventional:**  Test dose: 1 mg IV over 20-30 minutes.  Initial dose: 0.25 mg/kg/day IV, slowly increased as tolerated to a maximum of 1.5 mg/kg/day or on alternate days.  Infuse over 2-6 hours.
* **Liposomal:** 3-5 mg/kg/day IV infused over 30-60 minutes.  Can be increased to a maximum of 7.5-10 mg/kg/day in severe cases or for mucormycosis.

#### **Children:**

* **Conventional:** Similar dosing to adults, starting at a lower dose and escalating based on tolerance and therapeutic response.
* **Liposomal:**  Similar dosing to adults, based on mg/kg body weight.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Close monitoring of renal function is crucial, dosage adjustments may be needed.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose reduction or alternate-day dosing may be necessary for conventional amphotericin B. Liposomal formulations are generally preferred in renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Limited data exists, close monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Adjust dosages cautiously in patients with cardiac, electrolyte, or other relevant comorbidities.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations are based on specific infection and patient factors. The clinician should refer to the latest guidelines for specific recommendations in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are often necessary based on renal function, hepatic function, concomitant medications, and individual patient tolerance. Therapeutic drug monitoring may be helpful in optimizing therapy and minimizing toxicity.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Fever, chills, rigors, headache, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, muscle pain, hypotension, infusion-related reactions (flushing, fever, chills), electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), renal impairment.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Anaphylaxis, nephrotoxicity (acute kidney injury, renal failure), hepatotoxicity, cardiac arrhythmias, bone marrow suppression, seizures, pulmonary toxicity.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic renal insufficiency, electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia).


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Nephrotoxicity, anaphylaxis, infusion reactions.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to amphotericin B.  Caution in patients with pre-existing renal impairment.



## **Drug Interactions**

Nephrotoxic drugs (aminoglycosides, cyclosporine, tacrolimus), digoxin, antineoplastic agents, corticosteroids, flucytosine, azole antifungals.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Amphotericin B is generally considered safe during pregnancy, especially lipid formulations. It is not known whether amphotericin B is excreted in human milk.  The decision to breastfeed should consider the potential risks to the infant and the benefits of breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Binds to ergosterol in fungal cell membranes, causing cell death.
* **Side Effects:** Nephrotoxicity, infusion reactions, electrolyte disturbances.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to amphotericin B.
* **Drug Interactions:** Nephrotoxic drugs, digoxin, antineoplastic agents, corticosteroids, flucytosine.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Generally considered safe during pregnancy. Data on breastfeeding is limited.
* **Dosage:** Varies depending on formulation and clinical situation.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, electrolytes (potassium, magnesium), liver function tests, complete blood count.


## **Popular Combinations**

Flucytosine is sometimes used in combination with amphotericin B for synergistic effects, particularly in cryptococcal meningitis.


## **Precautions**

Close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes, and hepatic function is essential. Prehydration with normal saline may reduce nephrotoxicity.  Administer infusions slowly to minimize infusion reactions.  Caution in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment.
