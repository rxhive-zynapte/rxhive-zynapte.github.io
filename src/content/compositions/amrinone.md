## **Usage**

- Amrinone is prescribed for the short-term management of acute decompensated heart failure, particularly in patients who have not responded adequately to other treatments such as digitalis, diuretics, and vasodilators.  It is generally used as a temporary measure to improve cardiac function while other therapies are initiated or adjusted.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Inotropic agent, vasodilator.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Amrinone increases myocardial contractility (positive inotropic effect) and reduces systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance (vasodilator effect). It achieves this primarily by inhibiting phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) enzyme, leading to increased intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Elevated cAMP levels promote calcium influx into myocardial cells, enhancing contractile force. Additionally, increased cAMP promotes vasodilation by relaxing vascular smooth muscle.

## **Alternate Names**

- Inamrinone (International Nonproprietary Name - INN)
- Brand name: Inocor

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Amrinone exerts positive inotropic and vasodilator effects. The positive inotropic action increases cardiac output and stroke volume, while the vasodilator effect reduces preload and afterload, further improving cardiac performance.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Administered intravenously, therefore 100% bioavailable. Rapid onset of action (within 5 minutes), peak effect in 10 minutes.
    - **Distribution:** Minimally protein-bound (26-40%), volume of distribution of approximately 1.2 L/kg.
    - **Metabolism:** Metabolized in the liver primarily via conjugation to N-glycolate, N-acetate, O-glucuronide, and N-glucuronide (inactive metabolites).
    - **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion (approximately 63% unchanged in urine over 96 hours). About 18% of the administered dose is excreted in feces within 72 hours. Elimination half-life is around 2 hours, with effects lasting up to 8 hours.
- **Mode of Action:**  Inhibits phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) enzyme, which leads to increased intracellular cAMP, resulting in increased myocardial contractility and vasodilation.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Inhibits PDE3 enzyme. No significant receptor binding activity.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Loading dose: 0.75 mg/kg IV bolus over 2-3 minutes.
- Maintenance infusion: 5-10 mcg/kg/min IV.
- Maximum daily dose (including loading dose): 10 mg/kg/day.  In limited cases and for short durations, doses up to 18 mg/kg/day have been administered.

#### **Children (Not FDA approved, use with caution):**

- <28 days old:
    - Loading dose: 0.75 mg/kg IV over 3-5 minutes.
    - Maintenance infusion: 3-5 mcg/kg/min IV.
    - Loading dose may be repeated after 30 minutes if needed.
    - Maximum daily dose: 10 mg/kg/day.
- >28 days old:
    - Loading dose: 0.75 mg/kg IV over 3-5 minutes.
    - Maintenance infusion: 5-15 mcg/kg/min IV.
    - Maximum daily dose: 10 mg/kg/day.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and titrate carefully based on renal function and clinical response. Monitor for hypotension.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustments are needed based on creatinine clearance (CrCl):
    - Adults: CrCl <10 mL/min: Administer 50-75% of the dose.
    - Children: CrCl 10-29 mL/min: 50% of the dose. CrCl <10 mL/min: 25% of the dose. 
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments provided in current guidelines; monitor closely due to the potential for hepatotoxicity.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Amrinone is generally used in intensive care or similar settings for acute decompensated heart failure. Dosages for specific situations are as described above and titrated based on patient response and hemodynamic monitoring.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments based on renal function are outlined above. Monitor patients closely for adverse effects and adjust infusion rate accordingly.  Therapeutic range 0.5 - 7 mcg/mL. If there is no response or there is a significant drop in blood pressure, reduce or temporarily suspend infusion.
