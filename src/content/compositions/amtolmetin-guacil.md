## **Usage**

Amtolmetin Guacil is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is also indicated for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in children aged two years and older.

* **Pharmacological Classification:** Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID)

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Amtolmetin Guacil is a prodrug of tolmetin. It inhibits prostaglandin synthesis by blocking cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes. This action reduces inflammation and pain. Additionally, it stimulates capsaicin receptors in the gastrointestinal tract and releases nitric oxide, which has gastroprotective effects.


## **Alternate Names**

* **International/Regional Variations:** Tolecitin, Artromed, Juvisync, Niselat

## **How It Works**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Amtolmetin Guacil, after being metabolized to tolmetin, exerts its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, leading to a decrease in prostaglandin synthesis.

* **Pharmacokinetics:** Amtolmetin Guacil is administered orally. It is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and metabolized into tolmetin, its active form.  Elimination is primarily through renal excretion.

* **Mode of Action:** Inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.

* **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Primarily COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme inhibition.  It also stimulates capsaicin receptors in the gastrointestinal tract.

* **Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis:** Initial dose: 400 mg three times a day (1200 mg daily), ideally including a dose upon waking and at bedtime.
* The dosage may be increased up to a maximum of 1800 mg/day, divided into three doses, based on patient response after one to two weeks.

#### **Children:**

* **Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (age 2 and above):** Initial dose: 20 mg/kg/day, divided into three or four smaller doses. Maximum: 30 mg/kg/day.
* **Children younger than 2 years:** Use and dose must be determined by a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Initiate therapy at the lowest effective dose (600 mg/day). Closely monitor renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be necessary. Close monitoring is required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction may be necessary. Close monitoring is required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease):** Exercise caution and monitor for potential drug interactions and exacerbations of comorbid conditions.

* **Other NSAIDs and Corticosteroids:** Increased risk of gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding.
* **Antihypertensive Medications:** Reduced effectiveness of antihypertensive drugs.
* **SSRIs and SNRIs:** Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Alcohol should be avoided due to increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
