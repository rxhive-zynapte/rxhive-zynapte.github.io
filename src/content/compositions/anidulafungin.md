      Are there any significant drug interactions I should be aware of?**

      **A:** Clinically significant drug interactions are uncommon. No dose
      adjustments are needed for concomitant administration with ciclosporin,
      voriconazole, tacrolimus, amphotericin B, or rifampicin. Rifampicin may
      decrease anidulafungin exposure, although the clinical significance is not
      yet fully understood.

      Is Anidulafungin effective against all *Candida* species?**

      **A:** While Anidulafungin exhibits fungicidal activity against most
      *Candida* species, including *C. glabrata*, individual susceptibility
      patterns can vary.  It is crucial to consider species-specific
      susceptibility data where available.

      How long should treatment with Anidulafungin typically last?**

      **A:** The duration of Anidulafungin therapy should be guided by the
      patient's clinical response and the specific type of *Candida* infection
      being treated. Typically, treatment continues for at least 14 days after
      the last positive culture for candidemia and other invasive Candida
      infections.  For esophageal candidiasis, treatment continues for at least
      14 days and at least 7 days following the resolution of symptoms.

## **Usage**

- Anidulafungin is prescribed for the treatment of candidemia (a bloodstream infection caused by *Candida* species), other forms of invasive candidiasis (such as intra-abdominal abscesses and peritonitis), and esophageal candidiasis (a *Candida* infection of the esophagus).  It has not been sufficiently studied in patients with endocarditis, osteomyelitis, or meningitis due to *Candida*. It is also associated with high relapse rates in esophageal candidiasis, especially in patients with HIV infection.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Echinocandin antifungal agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Anidulafungin inhibits the synthesis of 1,3-β-D-glucan, a vital component of the fungal cell wall. This leads to cell wall instability and ultimately fungal cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

- International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Anidulafungin
- **Brand Names:** Eraxis, Ecalta

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Anidulafungin exerts its antifungal effect by disrupting the fungal cell wall. It is fungicidal against most *Candida* species, including *Candida glabrata* and isolates resistant to azoles and polyenes. 
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Administered intravenously; thus, 100% bioavailability.
    - **Distribution:** Distributes extensively into tissues.
    - **Metabolism:** Undergoes slow, nonenzymatic chemical degradation in plasma; not metabolized by CYP450 enzymes.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated via slow chemical degradation; negligible renal clearance.
- **Mode of Action:** Anidulafungin noncompetitively inhibits 1,3-β-D-glucan synthase, an enzyme complex responsible for synthesizing 1,3-β-D-glucan, an essential polysaccharide in the fungal cell wall. Inhibition results in cell wall stress, lysis, and fungal cell death.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition:** Anidulafungin specifically targets the fungal enzyme 1,3-β-D-glucan synthase. It's not known to bind to human receptors or significantly inhibit human enzymes.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Undergoes slow chemical degradation in plasma with negligible renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Candidemia and Invasive Candidiasis:** 200 mg loading dose on Day 1, followed by 100 mg once daily.
- **Esophageal Candidiasis:** 100 mg loading dose on Day 1, followed by 50 mg once daily.

#### **Children (1 month and older):**

- **Candidemia and Invasive Candidiasis:** 3 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg) loading dose on Day 1, followed by 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg) once daily.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to anidulafungin or other echinocandins.
- Known or suspected hereditary fructose intolerance (due to the fructose content in the formulation).


## **Drug Interactions**

- Clinically significant interactions are uncommon due to anidulafungin's non-CYP450 mediated metabolism.
- No dose adjustments are required for concomitant administration with ciclosporin, voriconazole, tacrolimus, amphotericin B, or rifampicin. 
- Rifampicin might decrease anidulafungin exposure, though clinical significance is not established.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Based on animal data, anidulafungin may cause fetal harm.  Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus.
- **Breastfeeding:** Anidulafungin is present in rat milk.  It's unknown if it's present in human milk. The decision to breastfeed should consider the potential risk to the infant.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits 1,3-β-D-glucan synthase, disrupting fungal cell wall synthesis.
- **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, hypokalemia, elevated liver enzymes, rash, anaphylaxis (rare).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, hereditary fructose intolerance.
- **Drug Interactions:** Few clinically significant interactions.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; potential fetal risk; unknown if present in human milk.
