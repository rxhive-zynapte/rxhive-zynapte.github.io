## **Usage**

Antacids with antispasmodics are used to treat gastrointestinal disorders characterized by cramps, spasms, and increased acid production, such as:
* Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)
* Peptic ulcers
* Gastritis
* Functional dyspepsia
* Biliary colic
* Pancreatitis

**Pharmacological classification:** This combination drug falls into two categories:
* Antacids (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium carbonate are common examples)
* Antispasmodics/Anticholinergics (hyoscyamine, dicyclomine, scopolamine, propantheline, etc.)

**Mechanism of Action:**
* Antacids neutralize excess stomach acid providing symptomatic relief from heartburn and acid indigestion.
* Antispasmodics relax the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract, reducing spasms and cramping.  They work by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that stimulates muscle contractions.

## **Alternate Names**

No specific alternate names for the combination exist, as it varies depending on the specific antacid and antispasmodic used.  Refer to individual drug names for synonyms.

**Brand Names:** Numerous brand names exist depending on the specific combination, including some containing phenobarbital.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**
* **Antacids:** Increase gastric pH, reducing the activity of pepsin and promoting healing of ulcers.
* **Antispasmodics:** Decrease gastrointestinal motility and reduce spasms by blocking muscarinic receptors in the gut.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Antacids:** Not absorbed systemically, act locally in the gastrointestinal tract, and are eliminated through the feces.
* **Antispasmodics:**  Absorption varies; hyoscyamine is well-absorbed, metabolized in the liver, and excreted mainly in the urine.  Other antispasmodics have different absorption and elimination profiles.

**Mode of Action:**
* Antacids primarily work through chemical neutralization.
* Antispasmodics act by competitively inhibiting the binding of acetylcholine to muscarinic receptors on smooth muscle cells.  This inhibition reduces muscle contraction and spasm.

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Antispasmodics bind to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, acting as receptor antagonists.

**Elimination pathways:** Varies depending on the antispasmodic. Hepatic metabolism and renal excretion are common pathways.


## **Dosage**

Dosages are highly variable depending on the specific antacid and antispasmodic combined, and the patient's condition. Dosages for individual components are described below. Consult specific product information.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Varies by product.

#### **Children:**  Dosages must be determined by a doctor, generally based on weight and age.

#### **Special Cases:**  Dosage adjustments are crucial for the elderly, and patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  Consult specific product information.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

These combinations are not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are essential based on individual factors such as age, renal and hepatic function, and coexisting conditions.  Specific product labeling and expert consultation are necessary.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
* Dry mouth
* Blurred vision
* Constipation
* Drowsiness
* Dizziness
* Urinary retention
* Headache


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, trouble breathing)
* Decreased sweating, dry/hot/flushed skin
* Fast/irregular heartbeat
* Mental/mood changes (confusion, hallucinations, agitation)
* Eye pain, vision changes
* Difficulty urinating, decreased sexual ability


### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic complications are rare with short-term use.  Long-term use of some antispasmodics can lead to dependence or tolerance.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

ADRs requiring immediate intervention include: anaphylaxis, severe cardiac arrhythmias, acute urinary retention, and angioedema.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation
* Severe ulcerative colitis
* Toxic megacolon
* Gastrointestinal obstruction
* Paralytic ileus
* Prostatic hypertrophy
* Bladder obstruction
* Narrow-angle glaucoma
* Myasthenia gravis
* Uncontrolled heart failure
* Severe renal impairment


## **Drug Interactions**

* Antacids can reduce the absorption of other medications, including some antispasmodics.
* Antispasmodics interact with numerous drugs, including other anticholinergic medications, antidepressants, antihistamines, and some antibiotics.
* Alcohol and certain foods (e.g., grapefruit juice) can alter the metabolism of some antispasmodics.
* Consult specific product information for detailed interaction profiles.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult individual drug information. Some antispasmodics are considered relatively safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding (e.g., hyoscine butylbromide), while others are contraindicated.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

Refer to sections above.

## **Popular Combinations**

Specific popular combinations vary depending on the region. Always refer to local formularies and prescribing information.


## **Precautions**

* Pre-existing conditions like glaucoma, urinary retention, or bowel obstruction should be carefully considered.
* Use with caution in elderly patients.
* Avoid activities requiring alertness (driving, operating machinery).
* Adequate hydration is important to prevent constipation.
