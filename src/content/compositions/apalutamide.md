## **Usage**

Apalutamide is prescribed for the treatment of:

*   **Non-metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (nmCRPC):**  In men at high risk of developing metastatic disease.
*   **Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer (mCSPC):** In combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Nonsteroidal antiandrogen, androgen receptor inhibitor.

**Mechanism of Action:** Apalutamide binds to androgen receptors, preventing androgens (like testosterone) from binding and activating them. This inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells, which rely on androgens for growth and survival.

## **Alternate Names**

*   INN: Apalutamide
*   Brand name: Erleada

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Apalutamide inhibits prostate cancer cell growth by blocking androgen receptor signaling.  It affects multiple steps in the androgen receptor pathway, including nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transcription.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Oral bioavailability is approximately 100%.
*   **Metabolism:** Primarily by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 enzymes in the liver.  N-desmethylapalutamide is the major active metabolite.
*   **Elimination:** Primarily via urinary excretion of inactive metabolites.  Approximately 65% is excreted in urine (1% as unchanged apalutamide, 3% as N-desmethylapalutamide) and 24% in feces (2% as unchanged apalutamide, 2% as N-desmethylapalutamide).
*   **Half-life:** Approximately 3 days at steady state.

**Mode of Action:** Apalutamide competitively binds to androgen receptors with high affinity, preventing androgens from binding and activating the receptors.  It exhibits no agonist activity, unlike some other antiandrogens.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Apalutamide specifically targets androgen receptors. Its primary route of metabolism is via CYP2C8 and CYP3A4.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

240 mg (one 240 mg tablet or four 60 mg tablets) orally once daily, taken with or without food.  Administer concurrently with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog or after bilateral orchiectomy.


#### **Children:** Not recommended. Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is necessary. However, patients â‰¥75 years may experience higher toxicity and lower tolerance. Close monitoring is recommended.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment needed for mild to moderate impairment. Caution is advised in patients with severe renal impairment due to limited data.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment needed for mild to moderate impairment.  Not recommended in severe hepatic impairment.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring is necessary for patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or other conditions. Manage risk factors optimally.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Apalutamide is not indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its use is limited to the specific prostate cancer indications mentioned above.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

For Grade 3 or higher toxicity or intolerable side effects, hold the dose until symptoms improve to Grade 1 or baseline.  Then resume at the same or a reduced dose (180 mg or 120 mg).  Discontinue for recurrent Grade 3 toxicity after dose reduction.  Permanently discontinue if a seizure occurs.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Fatigue, hypertension, rash, diarrhea, nausea, weight loss, arthralgia, falls, hot flashes, decreased appetite, fractures, peripheral edema.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Seizures, cardiovascular events (e.g., heart attack, stroke), severe skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Increased risk of fractures, cardiovascular disease, and hypothyroidism.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Seizures, severe hypersensitivity reactions, falls, fractures.

## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to apalutamide or any of its components.
*   Women who are or may become pregnant.

## **Drug Interactions**

Apalutamide interacts with numerous medications. Consult a comprehensive drug interaction resource for detailed information.

*   **CYP450 Interactions:** CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 substrates, inducers, and inhibitors may affect apalutamide levels.
*   **Medications:** Clarithromycin, ketoconazole, warfarin, simvastatin, midazolam, and many others.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy Safety Category:** X. Contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant due to potential fetal harm.

**Breastfeeding:** Not recommended due to lack of data on apalutamide excretion in breast milk.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** Androgen receptor inhibitor.
*   **Side Effects:** Fatigue, hypertension, rash, seizures (rare).
*   **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, hypersensitivity.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Numerous; consult a drug interaction resource.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy, not recommended while breastfeeding.
*   **Dosage:** 240 mg orally once daily.
*   **Monitoring Parameters:** PSA levels, cardiovascular function, bone health, thyroid function.

## **Popular Combinations**

Apalutamide is typically used in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), either a GnRH analog or bilateral orchiectomy.

## **Precautions**

*   Monitor for falls and fractures.
*   Assess and manage cardiovascular risk factors.
*   Monitor for seizures, particularly in patients with predisposing factors.
