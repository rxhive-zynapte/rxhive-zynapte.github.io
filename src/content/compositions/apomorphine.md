## **Usage**

Apomorphine is primarily prescribed for the acute, intermittent treatment of hypomobility, "off" episodes (end-of-dose wearing "off" and unpredictable "on-off" episodes) associated with advanced Parkinson's disease.  It belongs to the pharmacological class of dopamine agonists, specifically non-ergoline dopamine agonists. Apomorphine's mechanism of action involves stimulating dopamine receptors in the brain, mimicking the effects of dopamine, a neurotransmitter essential for movement control.

## **Alternate Names**

Generic Name: Apomorphine hydrochloride

Brand Names: Apokyn, Apokyn NXT, Kynmobi, Onapgo

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Apomorphine is a potent dopamine receptor agonist, primarily stimulating D1 and D2 receptors. This stimulation leads to improved motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease patients by restoring dopaminergic activity in the basal ganglia.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Subcutaneous (SC) injection provides rapid absorption with peak plasma concentrations within 5-20 minutes. Sublingual administration results in slower absorption.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver via glucuronidation and sulfation.
* **Elimination:** Excreted mainly through the kidneys. The terminal elimination half-life is approximately 30-60 minutes after intravenous administration and 1.7 hours after sublingual administration.

**Mode of Action:** Apomorphine directly activates postsynaptic dopamine receptors, bypassing the presynaptic dopamine neurons that are dysfunctional in Parkinson's disease.

**Receptor Binding/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Agonist at D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in the brain.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion with some hepatic metabolism.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (Subcutaneous Injection - Apokyn):**

* **Initial:** 1-2 mg (0.1-0.2 mL) SC as needed.
* **Titration:** Increase by 1 mg increments every 2 hours as needed, based on response and tolerance.
* **Maximum Dose:** 6 mg (0.6 mL) per injection; no more than 5 injections per day; total daily dose should not exceed 20 mg.


#### **Adults (Sublingual Film - Kynmobi):**

* **Initial:** 10 mg sublingually as needed.
* **Titration:** Increase by 5 mg increments if needed and tolerated, with at least 2 hours between doses.
* **Maximum Dose:** 30 mg per dose; no more than 5 doses per day.


#### **Children:**  Use and dose must be determined by the physician as safety and efficacy have not been established in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Initiate with caution due to the risk of postural hypotension. Start at the low end of the dosing range and titrate slowly.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce the initial dose and titrate cautiously, especially in severe renal disease. Avoid use in end-stage renal disease.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution as pharmacokinetic data is limited. Monitor closely.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration is required for patients with cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, or neuropsychiatric disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Apomorphine is not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use. It is specifically for intermittent treatment of "off" episodes in advanced Parkinson's disease patients. 


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on individual patient response, tolerance, and renal function.  Close monitoring of blood pressure, pulse, and motor symptoms is essential during dose titration.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, yawning, dizziness, drowsiness, hallucinations, dyskinesias, orthostatic hypotension, injection site reactions (nodules, bruising).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe hypotension, syncope, hallucinations, psychosis, QT prolongation, blood clots (with intravenous administration), allergic reactions (angioedema, anaphylaxis).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term side effects can include impulse control disorders (e.g., gambling, compulsive shopping).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Significant ADRs requiring immediate attention include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and severe hypotension.



## **Contraindications**

* Concomitant use with 5-HT3 antagonists (e.g., ondansetron).
* Hypersensitivity to apomorphine or its components, including sodium metabisulfite.
* Severe respiratory or CNS depression.
* Severe cardiovascular disease.
* Neuropsychiatric disorders, including psychosis and dementia.
* Severe hepatic impairment.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **5-HT3 antagonists:** Contraindicated due to the risk of severe hypotension.
* **Antihypertensives:**  Additive hypotensive effects.
* **Alcohol:**  Increased risk of CNS depression and orthostatic hypotension.
* **Dopamine antagonists:**  Reduced efficacy of apomorphine.
* **QT prolonging drugs:**  Increased risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Limited human data. Animal studies show potential for adverse effects.  Use only if clearly needed.
* **Breastfeeding:**  It is not known if apomorphine is excreted in breast milk. A decision should be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue the drug, considering the benefits and risks for both mother and infant.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Dopamine receptor agonist.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, yawning, dizziness, hallucinations, dyskinesias, orthostatic hypotension.
* **Contraindications:** Concomitant use with 5-HT3 antagonists, hypersensitivity, severe respiratory/CNS depression, severe cardiovascular disease.
* **Drug Interactions:** 5-HT3 antagonists, antihypertensives, alcohol, dopamine antagonists.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Limited human data; use with caution.
* **Dosage:** Refer to dosage section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, pulse, motor symptoms, ECG (for QT interval), signs of dyskinesias, neuropsychiatric symptoms.

## **Popular Combinations**

Apomorphine is often used in combination with domperidone (an antiemetic) to manage nausea and vomiting associated with apomorphine therapy.


## **Precautions**

* Pre-screening for cardiovascular disease, respiratory problems, neuropsychiatric disorders, and hepatic/renal impairment is crucial.
* Monitor blood pressure and pulse regularly, especially during dose titration.
* Educate patients about the risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope.
* Advise patients not to drive or operate machinery if experiencing drowsiness or sudden sleep episodes.
