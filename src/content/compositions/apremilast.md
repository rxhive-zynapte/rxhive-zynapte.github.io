## **Usage**

Apremilast is prescribed for the treatment of:

* **Psoriatic arthritis:**  A chronic inflammatory disease affecting joints and skin.
* **Plaque psoriasis:** A chronic skin condition characterized by red, raised, scaly patches.
* **Behçet's disease (oral ulcers):**  A rare disorder causing inflammation in blood vessels throughout the body. It frequently manifests with painful mouth sores.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Apremilast is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4).  Specifically, it targets the PDE4 subtype prevalent in inflammatory cells.

**Mechanism of Action:**  Apremilast works by inhibiting PDE4, an enzyme that breaks down cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). By blocking PDE4, apremilast increases intracellular cAMP levels, which in turn modulates the inflammatory response by reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (like TNF-α, IL-17, IL-23, and IFN-γ) and increasing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (like IL-10).

## **Alternate Names**

Apremilast is the generic name.

**Brand Name:** Otezla

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Apremilast's primary effect is the suppression of inflammation through the mechanism described above. Increased intracellular cAMP levels downstream of PDE4 inhibition modulate the inflammatory response by altering the balance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine production. This leads to a reduction in the inflammatory manifestations of psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, and oral ulcers in Behçet's disease.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Apremilast is well absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentration approximately 2.5 hours after administration. Food does not significantly affect absorption.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized via CYP3A4 (a liver enzyme), with minor contributions from CYP1A2 and CYP2C9.
* **Elimination:**  Approximately 68% of the dose is excreted in urine and 21% in feces. The terminal half-life is about 6 to 9 hours.


**Mode of Action:** Apremilast selectively inhibits PDE4.  This leads to increased intracellular cAMP, which downregulates pro-inflammatory mediators and upregulates anti-inflammatory mediators.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Apremilast specifically inhibits PDE4. It does not bind to or inhibit other PDE subtypes.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4, with renal excretion of metabolites.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Psoriatic Arthritis/Behçet's Disease:** Titrate to 30 mg twice daily (morning and evening).
* **Plaque Psoriasis:**  Titrate to 30 mg twice daily (morning and evening).

Titration schedule (for all adult indications):
* Day 1: 10 mg in the morning.
* Day 2: 10 mg AM and 10 mg PM.
* Day 3: 10 mg AM and 20 mg PM.
* Day 4: 20 mg AM and 20 mg PM.
* Day 5: 20 mg AM and 30 mg PM.
* Day 6 onwards: 30 mg twice daily (morning and evening).


#### **Children (Plaque Psoriasis only, 6 years and older):**

* **20 kg to <50 kg:** Titrate to 20 mg twice daily.
* **≥50 kg:** Titrate to 30 mg twice daily.

The titration schedule follows the same pattern as adults, reaching the maintenance dose on Day 6.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No dose adjustment is typically required, but monitor for gastrointestinal side effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    * **Mild/Moderate:** No dose adjustment.
    * **Severe (CrCl <30 mL/min):** 30 mg once daily.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with a history of depression or suicidal ideation.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  Apremilast's use is limited to the specific conditions mentioned above. There's no defined dosage recommendations for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are primarily made for severe renal impairment.
