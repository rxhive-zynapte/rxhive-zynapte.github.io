## **Usage**

- Argatroban is prescribed for the prevention or treatment of thrombosis (blood clots) in adult patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).  HIT is a serious immune-mediated complication of heparin therapy characterized by a drop in platelet count and an increased risk of thrombosis. Argatroban is also used as an anticoagulant in adult patients with or at risk for HIT undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
- **Pharmacological classification:**  Direct thrombin inhibitor, anticoagulant.
- **Mechanism of action:** Argatroban directly inhibits thrombin, a key enzyme in the coagulation cascade responsible for converting fibrinogen to fibrin, the main component of blood clots. By inhibiting thrombin, argatroban prevents clot formation.

## **Alternate Names**

- Argatroban monohydrate (chemical name)
- **Brand names:** Acova®, Argatroban Injection, USP, Novastan® (Discontinued Brand)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Argatroban reversibly binds to the active site of thrombin, inhibiting its enzymatic activity. This leads to a decrease in fibrin formation and reduced clot formation.  It prolongs the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and the thrombin time (TT).
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Administered intravenously, therefore 100% bioavailability.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation and aromatization of the 3-methyltetrahydroquinoline ring. Age and gender do not significantly affect argatroban's pharmacokinetics.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated in the feces (approximately 65%) through biliary excretion, with about 22% eliminated in the urine.
- **Mode of action:** Argatroban directly and reversibly binds to the catalytic site of thrombin. This binding blocks thrombin's ability to convert fibrinogen to fibrin, thus inhibiting clot formation. It does not require antithrombin III for its activity, unlike heparin.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation:** Argatroban acts through direct enzyme inhibition of thrombin.
- **Elimination pathways:**  Hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion into feces (primary), renal excretion (secondary).


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **HIT treatment/prophylaxis:** 2 mcg/kg/min as a continuous intravenous infusion.  The aPTT should be monitored, and the dose adjusted to maintain a target aPTT of 1.5 to 3 times the baseline value (not to exceed 100 seconds).
- **PCI:** An initial bolus of 350 mcg/kg over 3-5 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion of 25 mcg/kg/min. Activated clotting time (ACT) should be checked 5-10 minutes after the bolus. If ACT is less than 300 seconds, an additional bolus of 150 mcg/kg may be given, and the infusion rate increased to 40 mcg/kg/min.

#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy have not been fully established in pediatric patients.  Limited data suggest an initial infusion rate of 0.75 mcg/kg/min for children with normal hepatic function. For children with hepatic impairment, the recommended initial dose is 0.2 mcg/kg/min.  Dose adjustments should be made based on aPTT monitoring, aiming for a therapeutic range.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dose adjustment is recommended based on age alone. However, careful monitoring of aPTT and clinical response is necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is required for mild to moderate renal impairment.  For severe renal impairment, careful monitoring and dose adjustments are recommended as clinically indicated.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Moderate hepatic impairment: Initial dose 0.5 mcg/kg/min.  Severe hepatic impairment: Argatroban is contraindicated.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Patients with heart failure, critical illness or multiple organ dysfunction should receive lower initial doses (e.g., 0.5 mcg/kg/min) and careful titration based on aPTT response due to potential pharmacokinetic changes.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary in patients with other conditions associated with an increased risk of bleeding.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations:**  Argatroban dosing in these clinical settings is based on the underlying indication (HIT treatment/prophylaxis or PCI), with careful consideration of patient-specific factors like hepatic and renal function, bleeding risk, and concomitant medications.  Close monitoring of coagulation parameters (aPTT, ACT) is crucial.  Consult a hematologist for guidance in complex cases.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- Dose adjustments are based on the aPTT or ACT response, aiming for a therapeutic range.
- Renal/hepatic dysfunction necessitates dose reductions as outlined above.
- In patients receiving warfarin concomitantly, argatroban dose adjustments may be needed to achieve the target international normalized ratio (INR).


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Bleeding (e.g., at the injection site, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria)
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Diarrhea
- Fever
- Headache
- Back pain
- Hypotension


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Major bleeding (e.g., intracranial hemorrhage, retroperitoneal bleeding)
- Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
- Hepatic dysfunction


### **Long-Term Effects:**

- No specific long-term adverse effects have been identified, but prolonged use of any anticoagulant carries a risk of bleeding complications.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Any signs of major bleeding (e.g., decreased level of consciousness, hemodynamic instability, drop in hemoglobin) require immediate intervention.
- Allergic reactions necessitate prompt treatment with antihistamines, corticosteroids, and potentially epinephrine.



## **Contraindications**

- Active major bleeding.
- History of hypersensitivity to argatroban.
- Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).



## **Drug Interactions**

- Other anticoagulants (e.g., heparin, warfarin, dabigatran): Increased risk of bleeding.
- Antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel): Increased risk of bleeding.
- Thrombolytics (e.g., alteplase): Increased risk of bleeding.
- CYP450 interactions: Limited information is available on CYP450 interactions, though concomitant use with inducers or inhibitors should be approached with caution.
- Concomitant administration with warfarin increases INR and prothrombin time (PT).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** B (Animal studies have not shown fetal harm, but adequate human studies are lacking.)
- **Fetal risks:**  While animal studies have not shown fetal harm, argatroban should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  
- **Breastfeeding:**  It is unknown if argatroban is excreted in human milk.  Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, breastfeeding should be discontinued during argatroban therapy.
