      What is the recommended dosage for Aripiprazole?**


      **A:**  The recommended dosage varies depending on the condition being
      treated and the patient's age and other individual factors.  For adults
      with schizophrenia or bipolar mania, it's typically 10-15 mg once daily,
      up to a maximum of 30 mg/day. For major depressive disorder (as adjunct
      therapy) the dose is 2-5 mg/day up to 15 mg/day. Pediatric dosing and
      dosing for other indications should be determined on a case-by-case basis
      in consultation with clinical guidelines.

## **Usage**

Aripiprazole is prescribed for the treatment of various mental health conditions, including:

*   **Schizophrenia:** A chronic brain disorder affecting a person's ability to think, feel, and behave clearly.
*   **Bipolar I Disorder:** A mental illness that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, concentration, and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks.  Aripiprazole is used to treat manic or mixed episodes associated with this disorder.
*   **Major Depressive Disorder:** A common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act.  Aripiprazole is used as an adjunct to antidepressant therapy in adults.
*   **Irritability Associated with Autistic Disorder in Children:**  Aripiprazole can help manage irritability symptoms such as temper tantrums, aggression, and self-injurious behavior.
*   **Tourette's Disorder in Children:**  A disorder that involves repetitive movements or unwanted sounds (tics) that can't be easily controlled.


**Pharmacological Classification:** Aripiprazole is classified as an atypical antipsychotic.

**Mechanism of Action:** Aripiprazole acts as a partial agonist at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and an antagonist at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. This unique mechanism of action is thought to stabilize dopamine and serotonin neurotransmission in the brain, thereby reducing the symptoms of psychosis and mood instability.

## **Alternate Names**

Aripiprazole is the generic name.  

**Brand Names:**  Abilify, Abilify Maintena, Abilify Discmelt®, Abilify MyCite®.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Aripiprazole's therapeutic effects are believed to be mediated through its partial agonistic activity at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and antagonistic activity at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors.  This combination of actions helps to regulate dopamine and serotonin neurotransmission, which are often dysregulated in conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:**  Aripiprazole is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 3-5 hours.
*   **Metabolism:**  Aripiprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes, to active and inactive metabolites.
*   **Elimination:**  Aripiprazole and its metabolites are eliminated primarily through renal (27%) and hepatic (60%) routes, with a half-life of approximately 75 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Aripiprazole binds to and modulates the activity of dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT1A, and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in the brain. In regions with excessive dopamine activity, it acts as an antagonist, blocking the effects of dopamine. Conversely, in regions with low dopamine activity, it acts as an agonist, stimulating dopamine receptors. This "stabilizing" effect on dopamine neurotransmission helps alleviate symptoms of psychosis and mood disorders.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Aripiprazole primarily interacts with dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT1A, and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors as a partial agonist or antagonist.  It is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes.

**Elimination Pathways:** Aripiprazole and its metabolites are excreted through both renal and hepatic pathways.  Metabolism occurs mainly through CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Aripiprazole is primarily used for long-term management of chronic mental health conditions.  Its use in acute settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations (status epilepticus, cardiac arrest) is generally not indicated.  Short-acting intramuscular injections may be used to manage acute agitation or psychosis in patients already receiving aripiprazole.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications should be based on patient-specific factors, including renal/hepatic function, metabolic disorders, concomitant medications (especially CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors or inducers), and individual patient response and tolerability.
