## **Usage**

Arsenic Trioxide is indicated for the induction of remission and consolidation in adult patients with:

* Newly diagnosed low-to-intermediate risk acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) (white blood cell count ≤ 10 x 10³/µl) in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA).
* Relapsed/refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) (previous treatment should have included a retinoid and chemotherapy) characterized by the presence of the t(15;17) translocation and/or the presence of the promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic-acid-receptor-alpha (PML/RAR-alpha) gene.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antineoplastic agent.

**Mechanism of Action:** Arsenic Trioxide induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) in APL cells by promoting differentiation of promyelocytes and degradation of the PML/RAR-alpha fusion protein.

## **Alternate Names**

* Arsenious acid
* Trisenox (brand name)

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Arsenic Trioxide primarily targets leukemic promyelocytes, leading to their differentiation and apoptosis. It disrupts the PML/RAR-alpha fusion protein, crucial for APL development.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Administered intravenously, achieving rapid systemic distribution.
* **Metabolism:** Metabolized to arsenious acid (AsIII), the pharmacologically active form. Further methylation and oxidation can occur.
* **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion of unchanged drug and metabolites.

**Mode of Action:** Binds to cysteine residues in the PML portion of the PML/RAR-alpha fusion protein, leading to its degradation and promoting differentiation and apoptosis of leukemic cells.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Primarily targets the PML/RAR-alpha fusion protein.

**Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

Arsenic Trioxide must be administered intravenously, typically over 1-2 hours.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Induction:** 0.15 mg/kg/day until complete remission (bone marrow < 5% blasts, no evidence of leukemic cells) or up to a maximum of 60 days.
* **Consolidation:** 0.15 mg/kg/day for 25 doses over 5 weeks (5 days on, 2 days off), starting 3-6 weeks after induction.

#### **Children (4 years and older):** Similar dosing to adults.  Pediatric use requires careful monitoring.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Same dose as adults, with close monitoring.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dose reduction may be necessary if creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min. No data for dialysis patients.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution, monitor for toxicity. Dosage adjustments may be warranted in severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Assess and manage comorbidities (e.g., cardiac disease, diabetes) appropriately.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Arsenic Trioxide's clinical use is primarily focused on APL management and not typically employed in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or general ICU/emergency situations outside of APL-related complications.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on toxicity, including:

* **Hematologic Toxicity:** Dose reduction may be needed.
* **Hepatotoxicity:** Withhold if total bilirubin > 3 x ULN, AST/ALT > 5 x ULN, or alkaline phosphatase > 5 x ULN. Resume at a reduced dose (50%) after resolution.
* **QTc Prolongation:** Withhold Arsenic Trioxide and any QTc-prolonging medications.  Correct electrolyte abnormalities. Resume at a reduced dose after normalization.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia
* Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
* Fatigue, headache, dizziness
* Electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia)
* Elevated liver enzymes
* Rash


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* QTc prolongation, arrhythmias (including Torsades de Pointes)
* Differentiation syndrome (fever, weight gain, pulmonary infiltrates, respiratory distress)
* Hepatotoxicity
* Encephalopathy (including Wernicke's encephalopathy)
* Leukocytosis


### **Long-Term Effects:** Secondary malignancies (potential).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Severe differentiation syndrome, serious cardiac arrhythmias, hepatotoxicity, severe encephalopathy.

## **Contraindications**

* Medications metabolized by CYP450 enzymes.
* Monitor for interactions with concomitant medications.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Arsenic Trioxide is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential teratogenic effects and unknown risks to the neonate.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Induces apoptosis and differentiation of APL cells, degrades PML-RARα fusion protein.
* **Side Effects:** Myelosuppression, gastrointestinal effects, QTc prolongation, differentiation syndrome, hepatotoxicity, encephalopathy.
