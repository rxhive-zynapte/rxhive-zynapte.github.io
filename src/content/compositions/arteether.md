## **Usage**

Arteether is an antimalarial drug prescribed for the treatment of severe *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria, including cerebral malaria.  It is also used as a second-line treatment for chloroquine-resistant malaria.  Its pharmacological classification is as an antimalarial agent, specifically within the artemisinin group of drugs. It acts as a blood schizonticide, targeting the asexual blood stages of the *P. falciparum* parasite.


## **Alternate Names**

Arteether is also known as alpha-beta arteether. Brand names include Artebeta and Athemax.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Arteether works by generating free radicals within the malaria parasite. This process damages the parasite's cell membranes and disrupts its critical functions, leading to parasite death.  The drug specifically targets the erythrocytic stage of the parasite's life cycle, when it resides within red blood cells. By eliminating these parasites, arteether prevents the disease from progressing.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Arteether is administered intramuscularly. It is rapidly absorbed and metabolized, primarily by the liver. Though the exact metabolic pathways are not fully elucidated, evidence suggests involvement of the CYP3A4 enzyme. The drug is eliminated primarily through hepatic routes, with a smaller portion excreted renally.  

**Mode of Action:** Arteether's endoperoxide bridge is cleaved in the presence of the iron-rich environment within the malaria parasite. This generates reactive oxygen species (free radicals), which cause oxidative damage to the parasite's proteins and lipids, disrupting cellular function and ultimately leading to parasite death.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** The primary mechanism is not through receptor binding or direct enzyme inhibition but rather via free radical generation, as described above. Although, some research indicates possible interaction with membrane channel proteins.

**Elimination:** Primarily hepatic, partially renal.


## **Dosage**

Arteether is administered via intramuscular (IM) injection.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

150 mg IM once daily for 3 consecutive days.

#### **Children:**

3 mg/kg IM daily for 3 consecutive days.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are outlined in the available literature, but caution is advised due to potential age-related decline in organ function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Use with caution.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary in patients with severe renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No explicit guidelines exist for specific comorbid conditions. Clinical judgment is advised.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in specific clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations is not explicitly defined.  The standard dosing regimen is generally followed.


### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dose modifications are based on clinical judgment and patient-specific factors, including renal or hepatic dysfunction.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, dizziness, headache, vomiting, abdominal pain, cough, trouble sleeping, pain at the injection site.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Neurotoxicity (gait disturbances, loss of spinal cord responses, incoordination, respiratory depression, convulsions, cardio-respiratory arrest), cardiotoxicity (QT prolongation, arrhythmias)., neutropenia, elevated liver enzymes.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Limited data are available on long-term effects.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any sign of neurotoxicity or cardiotoxicity requires immediate medical attention.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to artemisinin derivatives. First trimester of pregnancy (except in life-threatening situations where no other suitable antimalarial is available).



## **Drug Interactions**

Arteether may interact with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 (inducers like rifampicin and carbamazepine; inhibitors like ketoconazole, HIV protease inhibitors). It should be used cautiously with QT-prolonging drugs (amiodarone, sotalol, quinine, quinidine). Concomitant use with other artemisinin derivatives (artesunate, artemether) is generally avoided. Interactions with mefloquine, halofantrine, and quetiapine have been reported.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Arteether should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy unless absolutely necessary due to the potential risk to the fetus.  Use in the second and third trimesters should be considered only if the benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus.  It's unknown whether arteether is excreted in breast milk. Caution is advised, and breastfeeding may need to be interrupted during treatment.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Generates free radicals within the malaria parasite, leading to its death.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, dizziness, headache, vomiting, abdominal pain; rarely: neurotoxicity, cardiotoxicity.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to artemisinin derivatives, first trimester of pregnancy.
* **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors, QT-prolonging drugs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid in the first trimester; caution in other trimesters. Caution during breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 150 mg IM daily for 3 days; Children: 3 mg/kg IM daily for 3 days.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for signs of neurotoxicity and cardiotoxicity (e.g., ECG for QT prolongation). Liver function tests and complete blood counts should also be monitored.



## **Popular Combinations**

Arteether is not typically used in combination with other artemisinin derivatives. It can be used with other antimalarials like quinine, but caution is needed due to potential drug interactions. 



## **Precautions**

Screen for allergies and assess hepatic and renal function before administering.  Exercise caution in pregnant and breastfeeding women, children, and the elderly. Patients should avoid driving or operating machinery if dizziness occurs.
