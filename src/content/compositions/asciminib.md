## **Usage**

Asciminib is prescribed for the treatment of adult patients with:

* **Newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML) in chronic phase (CP).**  This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on the major molecular response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).
* **Previously treated Ph+ CML in CP.**
* **Ph+ CML in CP with the T315I mutation.**

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Asciminib is a kinase inhibitor, specifically a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

**Mechanism of Action:**  Asciminib acts by binding to the ABL myristoyl pocket (also known as the STAMP), a distinct and previously untargeted allosteric site on the ABL protein. Unlike other tyrosine kinase inhibitors that bind to the ATP-binding site, asciminib's unique binding site allows it to inhibit BCR-ABL activity, including T315I mutant forms, which are often resistant to other TKIs. This leads to the suppression of the proliferation of leukemic cells.


## **Alternate Names**

**International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Asciminib

**Brand Name:** ScemblixÂ®



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Asciminib selectively inhibits BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase activity by binding to the ABL myristoyl pocket, thus preventing substrate phosphorylation and downstream signaling, ultimately leading to leukemic cell death.  It exhibits activity against various BCR-ABL1 mutations, including the T315I mutation, which confers resistance to many other TKIs.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Asciminib is administered orally and reaches peak plasma concentrations approximately 2 hours post-dose.  Food significantly decreases its absorption, hence it should be taken on an empty stomach (at least 2 hours before or 1 hour after food).
* **Metabolism:**  Asciminib is primarily metabolized in the liver, mainly via CYP3A4. It is also an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp).
* **Elimination:**  Asciminib is predominantly eliminated via biliary/fecal excretion (approximately 80%), with a smaller fraction eliminated renally (approximately 11%).


**Mode of Action:** Asciminib allosterically inhibits BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase activity by binding to the myristoyl binding site (STAMP) on the ABL kinase domain.  This unique binding mode distinguishes it from other TKIs and allows it to overcome resistance caused by mutations in the ATP-binding site, such as the T315I mutation.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Asciminib acts through enzyme inhibition (BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase). It is also an inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and P-gp.  It does not directly modulate neurotransmitters or bind to classic receptors.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily biliary/fecal excretion (about 80% of the dose), with a minor contribution from renal excretion (about 11%).
