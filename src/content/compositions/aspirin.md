## **Usage**

Aspirin is prescribed for various medical conditions, primarily focusing on its analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and antiplatelet properties.  It is commonly used for:

* **Pain relief:** Mild to moderate pain such as headaches, muscle aches, toothaches, and menstrual cramps.
* **Fever reduction:** Reducing fever associated with various illnesses.
* **Inflammation reduction:**  Managing inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and other inflammatory arthritides.
* **Cardiovascular disease prevention:** Preventing heart attacks and strokes in individuals at high risk, including those with a history of cardiovascular events, coronary artery disease, or stroke.
* **Prevention of colorectal cancer** (off-label):  Reducing the risk of developing hereditary colorectal cancer.
* **Kawasaki disease:** Treating Kawasaki disease in children.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

Aspirin is classified as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and an antiplatelet agent.

**Mechanism of Action:**

Aspirin irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzymes.  This inhibition reduces the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, which are involved in inflammation, pain, fever, and platelet aggregation.


## **Alternate Names** 

* Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)
* 2-acetoxybenzoic acid

**Brand Names:**

Aspirin is marketed under numerous brand names, including Bayer Aspirin, Bufferin, Ecotrin, Durlaza, and others.  Many generic formulations are also available.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

Aspirin's primary effects are mediated through the inhibition of COX enzymes. By inhibiting COX-1, it reduces thromboxane A2 production, leading to decreased platelet aggregation and prolonged bleeding time.  COX-2 inhibition contributes to its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Aspirin is rapidly absorbed from the stomach and small intestine.  Enteric-coated formulations delay absorption until the drug reaches the small intestine, reducing the risk of gastrointestinal irritation.
* **Metabolism:** Aspirin is hydrolyzed to salicylic acid in the liver, which is further conjugated to form metabolites.
* **Elimination:** Salicylic acid and its metabolites are primarily eliminated by the kidneys through renal excretion. The elimination half-life of salicylic acid increases with higher doses, extending from a few hours at low doses to over 20 hours at high doses.

**Mode of Action:** Aspirin irreversibly acetylates a serine residue near the active site of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, preventing the binding of arachidonic acid and subsequent prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Aspirin primarily acts through enzyme inhibition (COX-1 and COX-2).

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of salicylic acid and its metabolites.


## **Dosage**

The dosage of aspirin varies depending on the indication and patient-specific factors.  Always consult with a qualified medical professional for personalized dosing recommendations.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Pain/Fever:** 325-650 mg every 4-6 hours as needed. Maximum daily dose: 4000 mg (4 g). Controlled-release formulations:  650-1300 mg every 8 hours.
* **Cardiovascular Prevention:** 75-162.5 mg daily.  A dose of 81 mg daily is often preferred.

#### **Children:**

* **Pain/Fever:** 10-15 mg/kg every 4-6 hours as needed. Maximum daily dose: 60-80 mg/kg. Children 12 years and older can generally follow adult dosing.
* **Kawasaki disease:**  Consult specialized guidelines for appropriate dosing in this context.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lowest effective dose and monitor for side effects. Dose adjustment may be necessary based on renal function and comorbid conditions.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Use with caution in patients with creatinine clearance <10 mL/min. Dose adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dose adjustment may be necessary in severe liver disease.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider potential drug interactions and adjust the dose accordingly.  Patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or bleeding disorders require careful monitoring.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Aspirin is used in various clinical settings, and dosages may be adjusted accordingly:

* **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:**  Low-dose aspirin (75-162.5 mg daily) is often continued for patients already on aspirin therapy for cardiovascular protection, but the decision to initiate aspirin therapy in critically ill patients should be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the risks and benefits.
* **Emergency Situations (e.g., suspected acute myocardial infarction):** 162-325 mg (non-enteric coated, chewed) immediately upon suspicion of MI.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary based on patient-specific factors, including renal or hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism. Always consider potential drug interactions when determining the appropriate dosage.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, heartburn, indigestion)

* **Methotrexate:**  Increased methotrexate levels and toxicity.
* **Alcohol:** Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Aspirin is generally avoided during the third trimester due to the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in the fetus.  Use during the first and second trimesters should be under the supervision of a healthcare professional.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Small amounts of aspirin are excreted in breast milk.  Use with caution during breastfeeding and consult a healthcare professional.
