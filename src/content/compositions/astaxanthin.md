## **Usage**

Astaxanthin is primarily used as a dietary supplement for its antioxidant properties. While it is being investigated for potential benefits in various health conditions like age-related macular degeneration, cardiovascular disease, and exercise-induced muscle damage,  robust clinical evidence supporting its efficacy for these conditions is currently lacking. It's important to distinguish between its use as a general health supplement and a treatment for specific medical conditions. As of now, it is not prescribed as a drug for treating any specific disease.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antioxidant.


- **Mechanism of Action:** Astaxanthin's primary mechanism of action lies in its potent antioxidant activity. It scavenges free radicals and reactive oxygen species, protecting cells from oxidative stress and damage.



## **Alternate Names**


- **International/Regional Variations:**  None widely recognized.


- **Brand Names:** AstaPure速, AstaREAL速, BioAstin速, AstaVita速. Brand names can vary regionally.



## **How It Works**


- **Pharmacodynamics:** Astaxanthin exerts its antioxidant effects by quenching singlet and triplet oxygen, scavenging peroxyl radicals, and inhibiting lipid peroxidation. It also modulates inflammatory pathways and may offer some protection against UV-induced skin damage.


- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Astaxanthin is absorbed with fats in the diet. It is transported in lipoproteins and accumulates in various tissues, including the eyes, brain, and skin. Metabolism and elimination pathways are not fully elucidated, but hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion are likely involved.  CYP2B6 enzyme interactions are noted with astaxanthin.


- **Mode of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Astaxanthin's antioxidant action doesn't involve specific receptor binding or neurotransmitter modulation. Its effects are primarily mediated by its ability to neutralize free radicals directly and indirectly influence cellular signaling pathways related to inflammation and oxidative stress.


- **Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily through hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion. Some may be eliminated in feces.




## **Dosage**

It's important to emphasize that dosage recommendations for astaxanthin are based on limited clinical trials and usage as a dietary supplement.  As such, standardized dosage guidelines like those for prescription medications are not established.


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Typically, 4-12 mg daily is used as a dietary supplement.  Some studies have investigated dosages up to 40 mg daily.  


#### **Children:**

- No established pediatric dosage guidelines exist.  Use in children should be under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  



#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are established for elderly patients, but starting with a lower dose and monitoring for effects is advisable.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific adjustments necessary based on current knowledge.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Since astaxanthin is metabolized in the liver, caution is advised. Start with a lower dose and monitor.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is warranted in patients with bleeding disorders, diabetes, autoimmune disorders, or those on medications affecting hormones, blood pressure, or the immune system.




### **Clinical Use Cases**

Astaxanthin is **not** currently indicated for use in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dosage adjustments should be based on patient tolerance and individual response. Consider lower starting doses for patients with hepatic impairment or those taking interacting medications.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

- Increased bowel movements.
- Red stool color.
- Stomach pain (at higher doses).



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

-  No serious side effects have been consistently reported.



### **Long-Term Effects:**

-  Limited data exists on the long-term effects of astaxanthin supplementation.  



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- No specific ADRs requiring immediate intervention have been reported.



## **Contraindications**


- Hypersensitivity to astaxanthin or related carotenoids.
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding (due to lack of safety data).


## **Drug Interactions**

- Medications metabolized by CYP2B6: Astaxanthin can inhibit CYP2B6, potentially altering the metabolism of certain medications.
- Anticoagulants/Antiplatelets: Caution advised due to potential increased bleeding risk (although evidence is limited).
- Medications affecting the immune system: Potential for interactions due to astaxanthin's possible immunomodulatory effects.
- Cholesterol-lowering medications: Potential additive effects on cholesterol levels.
- Hormone-altering medications: Potential interactions with 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors are noted.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**


- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** No established category.  Avoid use due to insufficient safety data.


- **Fetal Risks/Teratogenicity:** Unknown.


- **Drug Excretion in Breast Milk:** Unknown.


- **Alternative Safer Options:**  None for specific indications, as astaxanthin is not used as a treatment for any particular disease during pregnancy or breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**


- **Mechanism of Action:** Antioxidant, potentially anti-inflammatory.


- **Side Effects:** Generally well-tolerated; increased bowel movements, red stool, stomach pain (at higher doses).


- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, pregnancy, breastfeeding.


- **Drug Interactions:** CYP2B6 substrates, anticoagulants, immune-modulating drugs, cholesterol-lowering drugs, hormone-altering drugs.


- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid use.


- **Dosage:** 4-12 mg daily as a supplement; higher doses up to 40 mg have been studied.


- **Monitoring Parameters:**  No specific parameters routinely monitored.




## **Popular Combinations**

- Astaxanthin is often combined with other antioxidants in supplement formulations. However, the clinical benefit of such combinations requires further investigation.



## **Precautions**


- **General Precautions:**  Start with a lower dose and monitor for effects.  Use caution in patients with liver disease or bleeding disorders.

- **Specific Populations:** Avoid use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Use with caution in children and adolescents.
