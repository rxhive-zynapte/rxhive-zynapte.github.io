## **Usage**

Atezolizumab is prescribed for the treatment of various types of cancers, including:

*   **Urothelial Carcinoma:**  Locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (bladder cancer) in patients who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy or whose disease has progressed during or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.
*   **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC):** Metastatic NSCLC in patients whose tumors have PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% and who have progressed during or after platinum-containing chemotherapy.  Also used as adjuvant treatment after resection and platinum-based chemotherapy in adults with stage II-IIIA NSCLC whose tumors have PD-L1 expression ≥1%.
*   **Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC):** Extensive-stage SCLC in combination with carboplatin and etoposide.
*   **Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC):**  PD-L1-positive, unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic TNBC in combination with paclitaxel protein-bound.
*   **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC):** Unresectable HCC in combination with bevacizumab.
*   **Melanoma:**  Unresectable or metastatic melanoma in combination with cobimetinib and vemurafenib.
*   **Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS):**  For patients 2 years and older.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Atezolizumab is a monoclonal antibody classified as an immune checkpoint inhibitor.

**Mechanism of Action:** Atezolizumab targets and binds to Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1), a protein found on some tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells. By blocking PD-L1, atezolizumab prevents it from interacting with the PD-1 and B7.1 receptors on T-cells. This blockade releases the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway-mediated suppression of the immune system, allowing T-cells to recognize and attack cancer cells.



## **Alternate Names**

**International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** atezolizumab

**Brand Name:** Tecentriq, Tecentriq Hybreza (in combination with hyaluronidase-tqjs for subcutaneous injection)



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Atezolizumab enhances T-cell activation and antitumor immune responses by binding to PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells, preventing its interaction with PD-1 and B7-1 receptors.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Administered intravenously or subcutaneously. Bioavailability is 100% for intravenous administration.
*   **Distribution:** Follows a linear, two-compartment disposition model. Volume of distribution at steady state is approximately 6.9 L.
*   **Metabolism:** Primarily cleared by catabolism, similar to endogenous IgG antibodies. No metabolic drug-drug interactions expected.
*   **Elimination:** Terminal half-life is around 27 days. Clearance is approximately 0.2 L/day.

**Mode of Action:** Atezolizumab acts by binding to PD-L1, thereby blocking the interaction between PD-L1 and its receptors, PD-1 and B7.1, on T-cells.  This inhibition releases the "brakes" on the immune system, enabling T-cells to effectively target and destroy cancer cells.

**Receptor Binding:**  Binds to the PD-L1 receptor.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily eliminated through catabolism (breakdown into smaller peptides and amino acids).



## **Dosage**
