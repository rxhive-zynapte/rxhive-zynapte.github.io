## **Usage**

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is primarily indicated for the conversion of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) to sinus rhythm.  It is also used in myocardial perfusion imaging studies.  ATP's pharmacological classification is as an antiarrhythmic agent. It slows conduction time through the atrioventricular (AV) node, interrupting re-entry pathways responsible for PSVT.

## **Alternate Names**

Adenosine.  Brand names include Adenocard, Adenoscan, and Adeno-jec.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** ATP exerts its antiarrhythmic effect primarily by slowing conduction through the AV node.  This is achieved by activating A1 adenosine receptors, which leads to hyperpolarization of cardiac cells and抑制 of adenylate cyclase, reducing cAMP levels. This results in a transient AV block.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  ATP is administered intravenously and has an extremely short half-life (less than 10 seconds), primarily due to rapid cellular uptake and metabolism by adenosine deaminase and adenosine kinase. It is metabolized to inosine and adenosine monophosphate. Elimination is rapid, mainly through renal excretion of metabolites.

**Mode of Action:**  ATP binds to A1 adenosine receptors on cardiac cells.  This binding results in the opening of potassium channels, leading to an efflux of potassium ions and membrane hyperpolarization. Concurrently, calcium channel opening is inhibited, further reducing cellular excitability and slowing conduction velocity, particularly in the AV node.  

**Elimination Pathways:**  Rapid metabolism within erythrocytes and vascular endothelial cells to inosine and adenosine monophosphate. Renal excretion is the primary elimination pathway for these metabolites.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

For PSVT: Initial dose of 6 mg as a rapid IV bolus over 1-2 seconds, followed by a saline flush.  If PSVT persists, a 12 mg bolus can be given after 1-2 minutes, followed by a final 12 mg bolus if necessary.

For Myocardial Perfusion Imaging: 140 mcg/kg/min as a continuous IV infusion for 6 minutes.

#### **Children:**

For PSVT (less than 50 kg): Initial dose of 50-100 mcg/kg rapid IV bolus. Subsequent doses may be increased by 50-100 mcg/kg increments every 1-2 minutes until sinus rhythm is achieved (maximum single dose: 300 mcg/kg).

#### **Special Cases:**

**Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and monitor closely.

**Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution is advised, as metabolites are renally cleared. Dosage adjustments may be required.

**Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific dosage adjustments are routinely required.

**Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with pre-existing lung conditions like asthma or COPD, heart conditions (e.g., 2nd/3rd degree AV block, sick sinus syndrome, long QT syndrome, heart failure, hypotension, recent MI), or cerebrovascular disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation:** Not routinely used.
- **Surgical Procedures:** May be used to treat intraoperative PSVT.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:**  Not routinely used.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  Used for managing PSVT.
- **Emergency Situations:**  PSVT.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**  Renal and hepatic impairment may require dose reduction.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Flushing, dyspnea, chest pain, lightheadedness, headache, nausea. These are typically transient and self-limiting due to ATP's short half-life.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe bradycardia, high-degree AV block, bronchospasm, hypotension, atrial fibrillation.

### **Long-Term Effects:**  Not applicable due to the drug's short half-life.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Severe bronchospasm, significant bradycardia, prolonged asystole.


## **Contraindications**

Second or third-degree AV block (except in patients with a functioning pacemaker), sick sinus syndrome (except in patients with a functioning pacemaker),  hypersensitivity to adenosine, bronchoconstrictive or bronchospastic lung disease, severe hypotension.

## **Drug Interactions**

Dipyridamole and carbamazepine potentiate adenosine's effects and require dosage reductions. Methylxanthines (theophylline, caffeine) antagonize adenosine's effects.  There may be interactions with other drugs affecting cardiac conduction.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category: C (FDA). Use only if clearly needed and the benefit outweighs the risk.  Data on breastfeeding is limited; use cautiously.
