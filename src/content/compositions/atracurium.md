## **Usage**

- Atracurium besylate is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) used as an adjunct to general anesthesia to facilitate endotracheal intubation, provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or controlled ventilation, and to facilitate mechanical ventilation in intensive care unit (ICU) patients.  It is classified as a neuromuscular blocker within the broader category of peripheral skeletal muscle relaxants.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Neuromuscular blocking agent, Skeletal muscle relaxant.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Atracurium competitively binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, antagonizing the action of acetylcholine.  This prevents depolarization of the muscle cell membrane, leading to skeletal muscle paralysis. It is metabolized primarily through ester hydrolysis and Hofmann elimination.

## **Alternate Names** 

- Tracrium, Atracurium besilate.

- **Brand Names:** Tracrium, BFS-Atracu (and various generic versions).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Atracurium causes dose-dependent skeletal muscle relaxation by blocking neuromuscular transmission.  It does not possess hormonal activity or analgesic properties.  Onset of action is rapid, typically within 2-3 minutes after intravenous bolus administration. Duration of action is intermediate, generally lasting 20-35 minutes.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Administered intravenously.
    - **Metabolism:** Atracurium undergoes spontaneous non-enzymatic degradation in plasma and tissues via Hofmann elimination and ester hydrolysis.  This unique metabolism makes it suitable for patients with hepatic or renal impairment, as it does not rely on these organs for elimination. Laudanosine, a metabolite, may accumulate in ICU patients with prolonged infusions.
    - **Elimination:** Atracurium and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine and bile.

- **Mode of Action:** Atracurium competitively blocks the binding of acetylcholine to nicotinic cholinergic receptors at the motor endplate of the neuromuscular junction, inhibiting ion channel opening and subsequent depolarization. 

- **Receptor Binding:** Nicotinic cholinergic receptors at the neuromuscular junction.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**  
#### **Adults:**  
- **Intubation:** 0.4-0.5 mg/kg IV bolus.
- **Surgical Relaxation:** 0.4-0.5 mg/kg IV bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 0.005-0.01 mg/kg/min or intermittent boluses of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg every 15-25 minutes.


#### **Children:**  
- <1 month: Safety and efficacy not established.
- 1 month - 2 years: 0.3-0.4 mg/kg IV bolus (under halothane anesthesia).
- >2 years: Same as adult dose.  Children may require more frequent maintenance doses.


#### **Special Cases:**  
- **Elderly Patients**: Initial dose at the lower end of the range, administered slowly.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: No dose adjustment necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: No dose adjustment necessary.
- **Patients with Cardiovascular Disease**:  Initial dose of 0.3-0.4 mg/kg administered slowly over 60 seconds.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  
- **Intubation:** 0.5-0.6 mg/kg IV bolus.
- **Surgical Procedures:**  Initial bolus of 0.4-0.5 mg/kg followed by maintenance doses as needed.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Initial bolus followed by continuous infusion. Rates ranging from 0.0045-0.0295 mg/kg/min (0.27-1.77 mg/kg/hour).
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Continuous infusion of 0.000011-0.000013 mg/kg/min (0.65-0.78 mcg/kg/min), titrated to effect.
- **Emergency Situations**: Rapid sequence intubation: 0.5-0.6 mg/kg IV bolus.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**  
- Skin flushing, redness, itching, hives, injection site reaction, transient hypotension, and changes in heart rate (tachycardia or bradycardia).


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C
- Atracurium crosses the placenta but is generally considered safe for use during cesarean section in appropriate doses.  Use in other stages of pregnancy should be carefully weighed against potential risks to the fetus. 

- **Breastfeeding:**  It is unknown whether atracurium is excreted in breast milk. Caution is advised.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Competitive neuromuscular blocking agent.
- **Side Effects:** Flushing, hypotension, tachycardia/bradycardia, allergic reactions.
