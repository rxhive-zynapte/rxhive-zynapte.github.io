## **Usage**

Atropine is prescribed for various medical conditions, including:

* **Bradycardia:** Slow heart rate.
* **Preoperative medication:** To reduce salivary and bronchial secretions.
* **Antidote for poisoning:**  Specifically for organophosphate insecticides, nerve agents, certain mushrooms (e.g., *Amanita muscaria*), and anticholinesterase overdose.
* **Ophthalmic conditions:** Pupil dilation (mydriasis) for eye examinations and treatment of uveitis and amblyopia.
* **Hypersalivation:** To reduce excessive saliva production.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Anticholinergic, Antimuscarinic agent.

**Mechanism of Action:** Atropine competitively and reversibly blocks the effects of acetylcholine at muscarinic cholinergic receptors. This action inhibits parasympathetic nerve impulses, resulting in effects like increased heart rate, reduced secretions, and pupil dilation.


## **Alternate Names**

* Atropine Sulfate

**Brand Names:**

* AtroPen (auto-injector)
* Atropine-jpm (various manufacturers)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Atropine counteracts the effects of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors in the parasympathetic nervous system. This leads to:

* Increased heart rate (positive chronotropic effect)
* Decreased secretions (salivary, bronchial, sweat glands)
* Bronchodilation
* Mydriasis (pupil dilation)
* Cycloplegia (paralysis of ciliary muscle, affecting accommodation)
* Reduced gastrointestinal motility

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Rapidly absorbed after intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, and endotracheal administration.
* **Metabolism:** Partially metabolized in the liver.
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted unchanged in urine; some metabolites also excreted renally.

**Mode of Action:** Atropine acts as a competitive antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5 subtypes). It binds to these receptors, preventing acetylcholine from binding and exerting its parasympathetic effects. 

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**

* Atropine competitively binds to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
* It does not inhibit enzymes or directly modulate neurotransmitter release other than by its competitive antagonism at muscarinic receptors.
* Elimination pathways: Renal excretion (primarily unchanged) and hepatic metabolism.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Preoperative:** 0.4-0.6 mg IV/IM/SC 30-60 minutes before anesthesia; may be repeated every 4-6 hours as needed.
* **Bradycardia:** 0.5-1 mg IV every 3-5 minutes; maximum total dose: 3 mg.
* **Organophosphate poisoning:** 2-4 mg (or higher) IV/IM initially, repeated as needed based on clinical response; may require large doses (up to 50 mg) in severe cases.


#### **Children:**

* **Preoperative:** 0.01-0.02 mg/kg IV/IM/SC (maximum single dose: 0.4 mg). Adjust dose based on weight and age.  
* **Bradycardia:** 0.02 mg/kg IV every 5 minutes for 2-3 doses (minimum single dose: 0.1 mg; maximum single dose: 0.5 mg).


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and titrate cautiously due to increased risk of adverse effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary based on renal function.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised; dose adjustment may be needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration is required for patients with glaucoma, cardiac disease, gastrointestinal obstruction, urinary retention, hyperthyroidism, and prostatic hypertrophy.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Intubation:** Administer before intubation to reduce secretions.
* **Surgical Procedures:** Administer preoperatively to reduce secretions and prevent bradycardia.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:**  May be used to reduce secretions.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  For managing bradycardia and other indications as needed.
* **Emergency Situations:**  Bradycardia, organophosphate poisoning, etc.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, elderly patients, and those with certain comorbid conditions. Monitor closely for adverse effects and adjust dose accordingly.


## **Side Effects**

Dry mouth, blurred vision, mydriasis (dilated pupils), urinary hesitancy/retention, constipation, flushing, tachycardia, dizziness, nausea, and headache.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Confusion, hallucinations, delirium, coma, paradoxical bradycardia (with low doses), ventricular fibrillation,  allergic reactions, and acute angle-closure glaucoma (in susceptible individuals).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic complications from prolonged use are rare but may include cognitive impairment (especially in the elderly) and dependence (with chronic misuse).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, acute angle-closure glaucoma, paradoxical bradycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and central nervous system toxicity (confusion, hallucinations, delirium, coma).


## **Contraindications**

* **Absolute:** Hypersensitivity to atropine or belladonna alkaloids, angle-closure glaucoma (except for emergency mydriasis), and urinary or gastrointestinal obstruction.
* **Relative:**  Tachycardia, myasthenia gravis,  acute myocardial ischemia or infarction, hyperthyroidism, prostatic hypertrophy, ulcerative colitis,  and reflux esophagitis.

## **Drug Interactions**

Atropine interacts with various medications, including:

* **Anticholinergics:**  Additive anticholinergic effects.
* **Tricyclic antidepressants, antihistamines, phenothiazines:** Increased anticholinergic effects.
* **Quinidine, disopyramide:**  Additive anticholinergic and cardiac effects.
* **Amantadine:** Enhanced anticholinergic effects.
* **Levodopa:** Decreased effectiveness of levodopa.
* **Potassium chloride (oral):** May increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration.

Other interactions may occur with certain OTC drugs, supplements (e.g., herbal remedies), and food/lifestyle factors (e.g., alcohol). Consult drug interaction resources for detailed information.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (FDA).  Animal studies haven't demonstrated fetal harm, but there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Use only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:** Atropine is excreted in breast milk in trace amounts. Monitor infants for potential anticholinergic effects (e.g., dry mouth, constipation). Consider the risks and benefits.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist.
* **Side Effects:** Dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, constipation, tachycardia, dizziness.
