## **Usage**

- Avanafil is prescribed for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) in adult men.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor.
- **Mechanism of action:** Avanafil increases blood flow to the penis by inhibiting the PDE5 enzyme, which is responsible for the breakdown of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).  cGMP plays a crucial role in smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum, allowing increased blood flow and facilitating erection upon sexual stimulation.

## **Alternate Names**

- International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Avanafil
- **Brand names:** Stendra, Spedra

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Avanafil selectively inhibits PDE5, leading to increased cGMP levels in the corpus cavernosum of the penis. This results in smooth muscle relaxation, increased blood flow, and ultimately, erection upon sexual stimulation.  It does not cause an erection in the absence of sexual stimulation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations reached within 30-45 minutes.  Food, especially high-fat meals, can delay absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme in the liver.
    - **Elimination:**  Mainly excreted in feces, with a smaller portion excreted in urine.  The elimination half-life is approximately 6-17 hours.
- **Mode of action:** Avanafil competitively binds to the catalytic site of PDE5, preventing the hydrolysis of cGMP.
- **Receptor binding:**  Specifically targets PDE5.
- **Elimination pathways:** Hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4, with subsequent fecal and urinary excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: 100 mg orally taken approximately 15-30 minutes before sexual activity.
- The dose may be adjusted based on individual response and tolerability, ranging from 50 mg to a maximum of 200 mg per day.  The lowest effective dose should be used.  No more than one dose should be taken within a 24-hour period.

#### **Children:**

- Avanafil is not recommended for use in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established in this population.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is generally required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    - Mild to moderate impairment: No dosage adjustment is usually necessary.
    - Severe impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min): Avanafil is contraindicated.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
    - Mild to moderate impairment: Initiate with the lowest effective dose (50 mg) and adjust based on tolerance.
    - Severe impairment (Child-Pugh Class C): Avanafil is contraindicated.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised in patients with cardiovascular disease.  For patients on stable alpha-blocker therapy, the initial dose should be 50 mg.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Avanafil is specifically indicated for on-demand treatment of erectile dysfunction and is not intended for use in other clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary based on individual efficacy, tolerability, and concomitant medications, particularly CYP3A4 inhibitors or alpha-blockers.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Headache
- Flushing
- Nasal congestion
- Back pain

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Priapism (prolonged and painful erection)
- Sudden vision loss or hearing loss
- Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling)
- Severe hypotension

### **Long-Term Effects:**  The long-term effects of avanafil are still under investigation.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Serious ADRs such as priapism, sudden vision or hearing loss, and severe allergic reactions require immediate medical intervention.


## **Contraindications**

- Concomitant use of nitrates (e.g., nitroglycerin), nitric oxide donors, or guanylate cyclase stimulators (e.g., riociguat).
- Severe hepatic or renal impairment.
- Hypersensitivity to avanafil.
- Conditions where sexual activity is inadvisable due to cardiovascular risk.

## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:**  Strong inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, ritonavir) are contraindicated. Moderate inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin) require dose reduction to a maximum of 100 mg every 48 hours or 50 mg every 24 hours.
- **Alpha-blockers:** Can cause additive hypotensive effects.
- **Antihypertensives:**  May enhance blood pressure lowering.
- **Alcohol:**  Increases risk of hypotension and other side effects.
- **Grapefruit juice:**  Can increase avanafil levels.
- Other PDE5 Inhibitors: Concomitant use is not recommended.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Avanafil is not indicated for use in women.  
- The safety of avanafil during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been established.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** PDE5 inhibitor, increases cGMP levels, leading to smooth muscle relaxation and increased penile blood flow.
- **Side Effects:** Headache, flushing, nasal congestion, back pain, priapism (rare), sudden vision or hearing loss (rare), allergic reactions (rare), hypotension.
- **Contraindications:** Nitrates, severe hepatic/renal impairment, hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors, alpha-blockers, antihypertensives, alcohol.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Not indicated for use in women.
- **Dosage:** 100 mg (initial), 50-200 mg (adjusted), maximum once daily.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, vision and hearing changes.

## **Popular Combinations**

Avanafil is typically used as monotherapy.  Combining it with other ED treatments is not recommended.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess cardiovascular status before initiating therapy.
- **Specific Populations:**  Not for use in women, children, or patients with severe hepatic/renal impairment.  Caution in patients with cardiovascular disease.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Limit alcohol intake.
