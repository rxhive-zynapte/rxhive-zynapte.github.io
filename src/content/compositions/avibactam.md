Avibactam is not available as a standalone drug but is used in combination with other antibiotics, such as ceftazidime. This information pertains to the combination of ceftazidime/avibactam.

## **Usage**

Ceftazidime/avibactam is prescribed for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) (in combination with metronidazole), complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) including pyelonephritis, and hospital-acquired pneumonia/ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HAP/VABP) in adults and certain pediatric populations.  It is classified as a **beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination**.  Avibactam itself acts as a **beta-lactamase inhibitor**, protecting ceftazidime from degradation by bacterial enzymes, thereby extending its effectiveness against resistant strains.

## **Alternate Names**

Ceftazidime/avibactam is marketed under brand names such as **Avycaz®** and **Zavicefta®**.  There are no widely used alternate names for avibactam itself.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ceftazidime exerts its antibacterial action by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), disrupting bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to cell death.  Avibactam inhibits a wide range of beta-lactamases (enzymes produced by bacteria that degrade beta-lactam antibiotics), preventing ceftazidime's breakdown and expanding its spectrum of activity against resistant organisms.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Both ceftazidime and avibactam are administered intravenously.  They distribute widely into various body tissues and fluids, including the lungs. Ceftazidime is primarily eliminated renally as unchanged drug, while avibactam is eliminated through both renal and non-renal pathways (including metabolism).

**Mode of Action:** Avibactam acts as a **suicide inhibitor of beta-lactamases**. It forms a covalent adduct with the active site of these enzymes, irreversibly inactivating them and preventing their degradation of ceftazidime.

**Elimination:** Ceftazidime is primarily eliminated by renal excretion. Avibactam is eliminated by multiple pathways, including renal excretion (as unchanged drug and metabolites) and non-renal mechanisms involving hydrolysis and conjugation.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Normal Renal Function (Creatinine Clearance [CrCl] > 50 mL/min):** 2.5 grams (ceftazidime 2 g/avibactam 0.5 g) every 8 hours by intravenous (IV) infusion over 2 hours.
* **cIAI:** Administer with metronidazole.

#### **Children:**

* **3 months to <18 years (CrCl >50 mL/min) cIAI/cUTI including Pyelonephritis:** 62.5 mg/kg (ceftazidime 50 mg/kg, avibactam 12.5 mg/kg) IV every 8 hours (max 2g/0.5g) infused over 2 hours. Patients <18 years of age with renal impairment have separate guidelines.

#### **Special Cases:**
* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is necessary for patients over 65 years with normal renal function (CrCl > 50 mL/min). Dosage should be adjusted for renal impairment based on CrCl.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are needed based on the patient's CrCl. 

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is required.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Close monitoring is recommended. 

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing is consistent across approved clinical use cases. Refer to the Standard Dosage section. 

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on creatinine clearance (CrCl). Consult the package insert or reputable clinical resources for specific dose adjustments.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, headache, and infusion site reactions.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis), *Clostridioides difficile*-associated diarrhea, seizures, acute kidney injury, and hepatotoxicity.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Potential for development of antibiotic resistance with prolonged use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe hypersensitivity reactions and *C. difficile* infection require immediate intervention.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to ceftazidime, avibactam, or other cephalosporins. Severe hypersensitivity to any other beta-lactam antibacterial agent (penicillins, carbapenems, monobactams).

## **Drug Interactions**

Probenecid can decrease avibactam elimination and is not recommended for co-administration.  Ceftazidime may cause false-positive urine glucose tests with some methods. Use enzymatic glucose oxidase methods.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Ceftazidime is excreted in human milk in low concentrations.  The presence of avibactam in human milk is unknown.  Use with caution in breastfeeding mothers. If the drug is necessary, monitor the infant for adverse effects.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Ceftazidime inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis; avibactam protects ceftazidime from beta-lactamase degradation.
* **Side Effects:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypersensitivity reactions, *C. difficile* infection, seizures.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to ceftazidime, avibactam, cephalosporins, or other beta-lactams.
* **Drug Interactions:** Probenecid.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if clearly needed; ceftazidime is present in breast milk, avibactam's presence is unknown.
* **Dosage:**  Varies according to renal function. See Dosage section.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function (serum creatinine, CrCl), signs of hypersensitivity, and clinical response to therapy.

## **Popular Combinations**

Ceftazidime/avibactam is often used in combination with metronidazole for the treatment of cIAI.

## **Precautions**

Assess renal function, history of drug allergies (especially to beta-lactams), and monitor for signs of superinfection (e.g., *C. difficile* infection). Caution is advised when using in patients with a history of seizures.
