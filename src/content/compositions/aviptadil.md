## **Usage**

- Aviptadil is prescribed for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with severe COVID-19.  It has also been studied for other respiratory conditions like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, and sarcoidosis. Additionally, it has been used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction in some countries.
- Pharmacologically, Aviptadil is classified as a synthetic vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) analog.
- Its mechanism of action involves binding to VIP receptors, particularly VPAC1 receptors on alveolar type II cells in the lungs. This binding leads to a reduction in inflammatory cytokines, inhibits viral replication, and has vasodilatory and bronchodilating effects. It may also prevent surfactant depletion.

## **Alternate Names**

-  Aviptadil is also known as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), RLF-100, and Zyesami (trade name).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Aviptadil binds to VIP receptors, specifically VPAC1, leading to a reduction in the release of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha. This anti-inflammatory effect helps to mitigate the cytokine storm associated with ARDS and COVID-19.  It also has vasodilatory effects, primarily on the pulmonary vasculature, leading to decreased pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressure, with increased cardiac output.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Aviptadil is primarily administered intravenously or via inhalation. It has a short half-life of approximately 1-2 minutes and an apparent volume of distribution of 14 mL/kg.  Aviptadil is predominantly eliminated by the kidneys, with about 35% eliminated in the first 4 hours and 90% within 24 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Aviptadil binds to VPAC1 receptors on alveolar type II cells, which are the same cells targeted by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  This binding prevents viral replication and the inflammatory cascade that leads to lung injury.  It also affects pulmonary vasculature.
- **Receptor Binding:** Aviptadil primarily binds to VPAC1 receptors.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (for ARDS in severe COVID-19):**

- Intravenous infusion: Administered via infusion pump in escalating doses over 3 consecutive days. 
- Day 1: 0.166 mcg/kg/hr (equivalent to 1 vial)
- Day 2: 0.332 mcg/kg/hr (equivalent to 2 vials)
- Day 3: 0.498 mcg/kg/hr (equivalent to 3 vials)
- Infusion Duration: Depends on body weight.
- <60 kg: 14-hour infusions
- 60-90 kg: 12-hour infusions
- >90 kg: 10-hour infusions


#### **Children:**

- Limited data are available for pediatric use. Consult a specialist if considering Aviptadil for children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Close monitoring is recommended, and dosage adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage modifications are likely required due to the renal elimination of Aviptadil. Consult a nephrologist for guidance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** While hepatic metabolism is not the primary elimination pathway, monitor patients closely.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Specific dosage recommendations for various clinical situations (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, emergency situations) are still under investigation.  Follow local guidelines and consult with specialists.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjust dosages based on patient response and tolerance. Consider renal function, hepatic function, and other comorbid conditions.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Diarrhea
- Hypotension
- Flushing (facial or cutaneous)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (e.g., rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing, anaphylaxis)
- Severe hypotension
- Electrolyte imbalances

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Long-term effects are not fully understood due to limited data on chronic use.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Limited data are available on drug-drug interactions.
- Caution is advised when using Aviptadil with antihypertensive medications as it can potentiate hypotensive effects.
- Monitor patients closely when co-administering with corticosteroids or immunosuppressants.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
