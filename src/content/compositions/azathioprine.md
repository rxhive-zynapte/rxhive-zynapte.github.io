## **Usage**

Azathioprine is prescribed as an immunosuppressant to prevent organ rejection after transplantation (e.g., kidney, heart, liver) and to treat autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus nephritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and other inflammatory conditions like vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE/lupus), and polymyositis.  Its pharmacological classification is antimetabolite/immunosuppressant. The drug works by suppressing the immune system by interfering with the synthesis of DNA and RNA, which reduces the proliferation of immune cells (like lymphocytes) involved in the immune response.


## **Alternate Names**

Azathioprine is also known as 6-[(1-methyl-4-nitro-1H-imidazol-5-yl)thio]purine.  Brand names include Imuran, Azasan, Azamun, Azapin, and Thioprine.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Azathioprine acts as a prodrug, converting to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), which is then metabolized into active metabolites, including 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGNs). These 6-TGNs are incorporated into DNA and RNA, disrupting cell replication and function, primarily targeting rapidly dividing cells like lymphocytes, thus suppressing the immune system.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Azathioprine is well-absorbed orally. It undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism via various enzymes, including thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT). TPMT activity is crucial as it influences the balance between the production of active metabolites (6-TGN) and inactive metabolites (6-methylmercaptopurine or 6-MMP). The drug is primarily excreted through the kidneys as metabolites.  Genetic polymorphisms affecting TPMT activity can lead to varied responses and toxicity risks.

**Mode of Action:** Azathioprine's mode of action involves blocking purine synthesis and inhibiting DNA and RNA synthesis.  Its immunosuppressive effect is mediated through the incorporation of 6-TGN into the DNA, which impairs cell division and causes cell death of lymphocytes. It does not bind to specific receptors, but primarily exerts its effects through metabolic interference with purine synthesis pathways.

**Elimination Pathways:** Azathioprine undergoes complex hepatic metabolism through various pathways, including TPMT, xanthine oxidase, and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT). Metabolites are primarily excreted through the kidneys.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The initial dose is typically 1 mg/kg/day, administered orally or intravenously once daily or in two divided doses. After 6-8 weeks, the dose can be increased by 0.5 mg/kg/day every 4 weeks, not exceeding 2.5 mg/kg/day.  The maintenance dose is adjusted based on therapeutic response and tolerance, usually between 1 and 3 mg/kg/day.

#### **Children:**

Similar to adult dosing, the initial dose is usually 1 mg/kg/day, with adjustments based on response and tolerance, not exceeding 2.5 mg/kg/day. Pediatric use requires close monitoring due to increased vulnerability to side effects.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosages should be at the lower end of the range, with careful monitoring for toxicity due to age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is necessary, guided by renal function assessment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Lower doses are indicated due to impaired metabolism, and hepatic function should be monitored.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustment and close monitoring may be required based on the specific comorbid condition, such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosing of azathioprine varies with indication.  For *kidney transplantation*, the starting dose is 3-5 mg/kg/day at the time of transplant, followed by a maintenance dose of 1-3 mg/kg/day.  For *rheumatoid arthritis*, the usual starting dose is 1 mg/kg/day, and it can be increased gradually. Azathioprine is not typically used for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or in emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on patient-specific factors, such as renal or hepatic dysfunction, TPMT enzyme activity, concomitant medications, and other metabolic disorders. TPMT genotyping or phenotyping is recommended to assess the risk of myelosuppression, and doses should be reduced in patients with low or absent TPMT activity.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**
Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, abdominal pain, unusual bruising or bleeding, fatigue, hair loss, skin rash, increased sensitivity to sunlight, mouth sores.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Pancytopenia (decreased red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets), liver toxicity, pancreatitis, infections (due to immunosuppression), allergic reactions, increased risk of malignancy (lymphoma and skin cancers).

### **Long-Term Effects:**
Prolonged use can increase the risk of infections and certain cancers.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
Severe bone marrow suppression, life-threatening infections, hepatitis, pancreatitis, allergic reactions requiring immediate medical intervention.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine, pregnancy (unless benefits outweigh risks), breastfeeding (though generally considered acceptable at low doses with precautions), known malignancy, active severe infections, very low or absent TPMT activity, previous treatment with alkylating agents in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.


## **Drug Interactions**

Azathioprine interacts with numerous medications.  Allopurinol, febuxostat, and other xanthine oxidase inhibitors should be avoided or used at significantly reduced doses, as they increase the risk of myelosuppression.  Concomitant use with other immunosuppressants (e.g., ciclosporin, tacrolimus, rituximab, tofacitinib) increases the risk of infections and other side effects. Live vaccines are contraindicated, and responses to killed vaccines may be diminished.  Interactions with certain medications (e.g., warfarin, aminosalicylates, some antibiotics) can alter their effects.  Food and lifestyle factors like milk/dairy products (reduce azathioprine absorption) and alcohol (may increase liver toxicity) should be considered.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Azathioprine is generally considered acceptable during breastfeeding with appropriate precautions. It passes into breast milk at low levels, which are considered generally safe for infants. Monitoring the infant's blood counts and liver function is advised in certain situations.  It is recommended to discard breast milk for 4 hours after taking azathioprine to minimize infant exposure.  Although data suggests low risk in pregnancy, it can increase the risk of miscarriage, low birth weight, and preterm delivery. Contraception is recommended during treatment.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Immunosuppressant antimetabolite; interferes with DNA synthesis.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, bone marrow suppression, increased infection risk, liver toxicity, pancreatitis, malignancy risk.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, pregnancy (unless benefits outweigh risks), breastfeeding (with precautions), very low/absent TPMT, active infection, malignancy.

* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally acceptable during breastfeeding with precautions; use contraception during treatment; low risk in pregnancy.
* **Dosage:** 1-3 mg/kg/day, adjust based on response and tolerance; renal/hepatic impairment requires dose reduction.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Complete blood counts, liver function tests, renal function, TPMT activity.


## **Popular Combinations**

Azathioprine is sometimes used in combination with corticosteroids in certain conditions like lupus nephritis and organ transplantation.  It can also be used with other immunosuppressants, but careful monitoring for toxicity is crucial.  Its use with biologics for Inflammatory Bowel Disease is established, and often used at lower doses (e.g., 1.3 mg/kg).


## **Precautions**
Pre-screening is essential for assessing TPMT activity, renal/hepatic function, and potential drug interactions.  For pregnant women, the risks and benefits must be carefully considered. For breastfeeding mothers, monitor infant's health and consider discarding breast milk for 4 hours after the dose. For children and the elderly, close monitoring is needed due to their vulnerability to adverse effects.  Alcohol consumption should be limited.  Regular monitoring of blood counts, liver and renal function is essential throughout treatment.
