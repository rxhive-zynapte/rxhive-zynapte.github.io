## **Usage**

- Azelnidipine is prescribed for the treatment of essential hypertension (high blood pressure), specifically Stage I and Stage II hypertension.  
- **Pharmacological classification:** Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Azelnidipine primarily blocks L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle. This inhibition reduces calcium influx into cells, leading to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels). The resulting decrease in peripheral vascular resistance lowers blood pressure. It also exhibits some blocking activity on T-type calcium channels, impacting the sinoatrial (SA) node and potentially contributing to a negative chronotropic effect (reduced heart rate) and inhibition of aldosterone synthesis.

## **Alternate Names**

-  No widely used alternate names exist. It is sometimes referred to by its developmental code name CS-905.
- **Brand Names:**  Azelikem, Calnip, Azel

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Azelnidipine lowers blood pressure by inducing vasodilation through calcium channel blockade. Its selectivity for vascular tissue over cardiac tissue minimizes adverse cardiac effects. It demonstrates a slow onset and prolonged duration of action, leading to a stable antihypertensive effect. It may also exert antioxidative properties.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Azelnidipine is rapidly and dose-dependently absorbed after oral administration. The time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) is approximately 2.3â€“3.7 hours. Food may delay the time to peak plasma concentration but doesn't substantially alter the overall absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4 enzyme, with some metabolism also taking place in the small intestine. The dihydropyridine ring is oxidized during metabolism.
    - **Elimination:** Approximately 26% of the drug is excreted in urine and 63% in feces within seven days of administration. The terminal elimination half-life is around 16-32.5 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing.
- **Mode of Action:** Azelnidipine blocks the entry of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac myocytes by inhibiting L-type calcium channels.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Binds to L-type calcium channels, inhibiting calcium ion influx. Primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, making it susceptible to drug interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4, followed by excretion in both urine and feces.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: 8 mg orally once daily, after breakfast.
- Maintenance dose: 8-16 mg orally once daily, adjusted based on the patient's response.
- Maximum dose: 16 mg/day.

#### **Children:**

- Not established. Use is not recommended in children due to the lack of safety and efficacy data.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a low dose (e.g., 8 mg) and titrate cautiously while monitoring for hypotension.  
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments might be necessary based on kidney function and clinical response. Close monitoring of patients with severe renal impairment is advised, especially in the early stages of treatment and during dosage increases.  
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Initiate with a lower dose and titrate with caution. Close monitoring is recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment.  
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dose adjustments may be needed based on existing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and co-administered drugs.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for these specific medical settings have not been explicitly established. Clinical judgment and patient-specific factors should guide dosing in such situations. General dosing guidelines apply.

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations** (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest)


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments should be based on patient-specific factors like renal/hepatic dysfunction, other medical conditions, concomitant medication, and individual patient response.  Start low, go slow.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term complications are not well-documented, but monitoring of cardiovascular and metabolic parameters is advisable.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs include angioedema, severe hypotension, hepatic dysfunction, and pancreatitis. Immediate intervention is required if these occur.


## **Contraindications**

## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:**  Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors can significantly increase azelnidipine plasma levels, increasing the risk of side effects.
- **CYP3A4 Inducers:**  CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, St. John's Wort) can decrease azelnidipine plasma concentrations, potentially reducing its effectiveness.
- **Other Antihypertensives:** Combining with other antihypertensives may enhance blood pressure lowering, requiring dosage adjustments.
- **Grapefruit juice:** Avoid concurrent consumption as it inhibits CYP3A4 and may increase azelnidipine levels.
- Other medications: Itraconazole, miconazole, HIV protease inhibitors (ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir), phenytoin, phenobarbital, simvastatin, digoxin, rifampicin.
