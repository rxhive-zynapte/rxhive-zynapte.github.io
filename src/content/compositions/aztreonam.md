## **Usage**

Aztreonam is a synthetic monobactam antibiotic primarily prescribed for infections caused by susceptible gram-negative bacteria. It is effective against a broad range of gram-negative aerobes, including *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Enterobacteriaceae* species (such as *Escherichia coli*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, *Proteus mirabilis*, and *Serratia marcescens*), and *Haemophilus influenzae*.  It is indicated for various infections, including urinary tract infections, lower respiratory tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, septicemia, intra-abdominal infections, gynecological infections, and meningitis. Additionally, inhaled aztreonam is specifically indicated for the suppressive therapy of chronic *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis aged six years and older.

Its pharmacological classification is **antibiotic** (specifically, a monobactam).

Aztreonam's mechanism of action involves inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP3) of gram-negative bacteria. This binding disrupts the cross-linking of peptidoglycans, a crucial component of the bacterial cell wall, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.  It is highly resistant to hydrolysis by many narrow-spectrum Î²-lactamases, granting it effectiveness against bacteria that produce these enzymes.

## **Alternate Names**

Aztreonam is also known as aztreonam lysine (for inhalation).  Popular brand names include Azactam and Cayston.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Aztreonam exerts its bactericidal effect by disrupting the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall.  It specifically targets PBP3, which is essential for the final step of peptidoglycan cross-linking in gram-negative bacteria.  This leads to cell wall instability and eventual bacterial lysis.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Aztreonam administered intravenously or intramuscularly is rapidly and completely absorbed. Inhaled administration results in low systemic absorption.
* **Distribution:**  It is widely distributed throughout the body, including the cerebrospinal fluid, achieving therapeutic concentrations in various tissues and organs.
* **Metabolism:** Aztreonam is not extensively metabolized.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated via renal excretion, with approximately 60-80% of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 hours.  A small portion is eliminated through biliary excretion.  The elimination half-life is around 1.5-2 hours in adults with normal renal function.


**Mode of Action:** Aztreonam's mode of action involves selective binding to and inhibition of PBP3 in gram-negative bacteria. This interference with PBP3 activity leads to a deficiency in peptidoglycan synthesis and consequent cell wall instability, resulting in bacterial cell death. 


**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Aztreonam's primary mechanism is the inhibition of PBP3, a bacterial enzyme. There is no significant interaction with human receptors or neurotransmitters.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Aztreonam is predominantly eliminated through renal excretion.  A minor fraction undergoes biliary excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Intravenous/Intramuscular:** 
    * **Moderately severe systemic infections:** 1-2 g every 8-12 hours.
    * **Severe systemic or life-threatening infections:** 2 g every 6-8 hours.
    * **Urinary tract infections:** 0.5-1 g every 8-12 hours.
    * **Uncomplicated gonorrhea/cystitis (IM):** 1 g single dose.
* **Inhalation (Cayston):** 75 mg three times daily (at least 4 hours apart) for 28 days, followed by a 28-day drug-free period. This cycle can be repeated.

**Maximum daily dose:** 8 g.


#### **Children (over one week old):**

* **Intravenous:**
    * **Mild to moderate infections:** 30 mg/kg every 6-8 hours.
    * **Severe infections (2 years and older):** 50 mg/kg every 6-8 hours.
    * **Pseudomonal infections:** 50 mg/kg every 6-8 hours.
* **Maximum daily dose:** Not to exceed adult maximum (8 g).



#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Renal function should be assessed; dose adjustments may be necessary based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are crucial.  For creatinine clearance 10-30 mL/min, halve the dose after an initial loading dose. For creatinine clearance <10 mL/min, give one-fourth of the usual dose at standard intervals, with a supplemental dose (one-eighth of initial dose) after each hemodialysis session.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.  Monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider potential drug interactions and adjust other medications as needed.



### **Clinical Use Cases:**


Dosages in clinical settings generally adhere to standard recommendations based on infection severity and organism susceptibility.  Empiric therapy with concurrent coverage for gram-positive organisms may be initiated in seriously ill patients.  

* **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:** Dosing follows standard guidelines based on the infection being treated.
* **Emergency Situations:**  Standard dosing for severe or life-threatening infections applies.



### **Dosage Adjustments:**  Dose modification is required based on creatinine clearance in patients with renal impairment.


## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects:**
* Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling).
* Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
* Rash.
* Dizziness, headache.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction).
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis.
* *Clostridioides difficile* infection.
* Seizures.
* Hepatic dysfunction.
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome.


### **Long-Term Effects:**  Chronic complications are uncommon with appropriate use. Potential for *C. difficile* infection and development of antibiotic resistance with prolonged use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
* Anaphylaxis.
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis.
* Severe *C. difficile* infection.


## **Contraindications**

* Known hypersensitivity to aztreonam.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Cefoxitin/Imipenem:**  May induce beta-lactamase production in some gram-negative bacteria, leading to antagonism with aztreonam. Avoid concurrent use.
* **Oral anticoagulants:** May prolong prothrombin time. Monitor coagulation parameters.
* **Aminoglycosides:** Increased risk of nephrotoxicity.  Monitor renal function.
* **Probenecid:** Increases aztreonam serum levels.
* **Cholera and typhoid vaccines:** Aztreonam may interfere with the efficacy of live bacterial vaccines.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:** B (Animal studies have not demonstrated fetal harm, but adequate human studies are lacking).  Aztreonam crosses the placenta. Use only if clearly needed.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Aztreonam is excreted in breast milk at low concentrations (<1% of maternal serum levels).  Consider the benefits of breastfeeding alongside the potential risks to the infant.  The American Academy of Pediatrics considers aztreonam compatible with breastfeeding.
