## **Usage**

Bacillus mesentericus TO-A JPC is a probiotic bacterium primarily used to restore and maintain healthy gut flora.  It is often used in combination with other probiotic strains, such as *Streptococcus faecalis T-110 JPC*, *Clostridium butyricum TO-A*, and *Lactobacillus sporogenes (Lactic acid bacillus)*.  Its pharmacological classification is as a probiotic or biological agent.

It is indicated for conditions like:

* Infectious Diarrhea (viral, bacterial, and protozoal)
* Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea (AAD)
* Lactose Intolerance
* Restoring intestinal microflora after antibiotic treatment
* Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)
* Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
* *Helicobacter pylori* infection
* Gastroenteritis
* Dysbacteriosis
* Allergic disorders
* Obesity
* Common cold
* Eczema
* Inflammatory arthritis
* Vaginal yeast infections
* Urinary tract infections

The mechanism of action involves promoting a balanced intestinal environment, reducing the proliferation of harmful bacteria, and improving nutrient absorption.  Bacillus mesentericus inhibits the growth of pathogenic bacteria and aids in digestion by regulating abnormal movements.


## **Alternate Names**

Bacillus mesentericus is commonly found as a component of probiotic formulations.  It is often listed in combination with other probiotic strains and doesn't typically have a unique pharmaceutical name.  Some brand names that include this combination are Colonise Forte, Bifilac HP, and Vibact.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Bacillus mesentericus TO-A JPC, as a component of multi-strain probiotic formulations, primarily exerts its effects by promoting a balanced gut microbiome. This can involve competitive exclusion of pathogenic bacteria, production of antimicrobial substances, enhancement of the intestinal barrier function, and modulation of the host immune system. The specific strains *Streptococcus faecalis T-110 JPC*, *Clostridium butyricum TO-A*, and *Lactobacillus sporogenes* contribute synergistically to these effects. *Clostridium butyricum TO-A*, for example, produces butyric acid, a short-chain fatty acid crucial for colonic health. *Lactobacillus sporogenes* helps maintain a balanced microflora.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The pharmacokinetics of Bacillus mesentericus TO-A JPC, when administered orally as part of a probiotic formulation, are not fully characterized as it is not absorbed systemically. It primarily resides in the gastrointestinal tract, where it exerts its effects locally. Elimination is presumed to be through fecal excretion.  However, it's important to note that the other strains included in typical formulations may exhibit different pharmacokinetic profiles. For example, lactic acid bacillus may transiently colonize the gut.  



## **Dosage**

Bacillus mesentericus TO-A JPC is typically found in combination with other probiotic strains, and dosages vary based on the specific product formulation. Always refer to the specific product's packaging and prescribing information for the most accurate dosage information.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  One sachet or capsule containing Bacillus mesentericus TO-A JPC, typically combined with other probiotics, may be taken two to three times daily or as directed by a physician.  

#### **Children:** Consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosing in children.

#### **Special Cases:** Dosage adjustments for elderly patients, those with renal/hepatic impairment, or comorbid conditions should be determined on a case-by-case basis by a physician.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in clinical situations depends greatly on the specific product and the patient's condition.  No specific guidelines exist for these use cases for this specific probiotic component, but a physician should evaluate each scenario and make appropriate adjustments.

* **Intubation:**  Consult a physician.
* **Surgical Procedures:** Consult a physician.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** Consult a physician.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Consult a physician.
* **Emergency Situations:** Consult a physician.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications based on renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms should be considered by a physician on a case-by-case basis, as there are no established guidelines for this specific probiotic strain.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Gas
* Bloating
* Abdominal discomfort
* Nausea
* Loss of appetite
* Constipation
* Diarrhea


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Although rare, serious adverse events, like systemic infections (bacteremia, endocarditis), have been reported, especially in individuals with underlying health issues or compromised immune systems.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Limited data is available on the long-term effects of Bacillus mesentericus TO-A JPC.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe adverse reactions are rare but can include systemic infection.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation
* Critically ill patients
* Short bowel syndrome


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Antibiotics:**  Antibiotics can reduce the efficacy of probiotics.  It's generally recommended to separate administration by at least two hours.  Some specific antibiotics, such as neomycin, aminosalicylic acid, and chloramphenicol, may have further interactions.
* **Other Medications:**  Consult a physician regarding interactions with other medications like histamine H2-antagonists, omeprazole, colchicine, oral contraceptives, co-trimoxazole, sulfasalazine, and methotrexate.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult a physician before use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. While generally considered safe, limited clinical data is available specifically for Bacillus mesentericus TO-A JPC.  Caution is advised.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Promotes balanced gut flora, inhibits pathogenic bacteria.
* **Side Effects:** Gas, bloating, abdominal discomfort, nausea, constipation, diarrhea.  Rarely, systemic infection.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, critically ill patients, short bowel syndrome.
