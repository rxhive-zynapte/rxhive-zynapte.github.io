## **Usage**

*Bacillus mesentericus* is a probiotic bacterium, often found in multi-strain probiotic formulations, used to treat and prevent gastrointestinal disorders.  It is commonly prescribed for conditions like:

* Antibiotic-associated diarrhea
* Infectious diarrhea
* Gastroenteritis
* Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
* Constipation
* *Clostridium difficile* associated diarrhea
* *Helicobacter pylori* infection
* Traveler's diarrhea
* Lactose intolerance
* Dysbacteriosis (gut flora imbalance)


It is also sometimes used for conditions such as allergic disorders, obesity, common cold, eczema, inflammatory arthritis, vaginal yeast infections, and urinary tract infections. Its pharmacological classification is as a probiotic.

*Bacillus mesentericus* contributes to gut health by producing enzymes that aid digestion and by competing with harmful bacteria. It is a spore-forming bacterium, which means it can survive the harsh acidic conditions of the stomach and reach the intestines where it can exert its beneficial effects.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for *Bacillus mesentericus* itself. However, since it's often used in combination with other probiotics, different formulations have different brand names. One example is Bifilac, which contains *Streptococcus faecalis*, *Clostridium butyricum*, *Bacillus mesentericus*, and *Lactobacillus sporogenes*.  Another brand is Bactolac which also contains *Streptococcus faecalis*, *Clostridium butyricum*, *Bacillus mesentericus*, and *Lactobacillus sporogenes*.  Vebiotic is another example of a combination formulation containing *Bacillus mesentericus*.



## **How It Works**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** *Bacillus mesentericus* primarily affects the gut by improving the balance of intestinal microflora. It promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria and inhibits the growth of harmful bacteria. It does so by competing for resources and altering the gut environment (pH, production of antimicrobial substances).  It also improves the gastrointestinal ecology and supports a balanced inflammatory response. Certain strains assist in breaking down complex carbohydrates. It produces enzymes that help regulate abnormal bowel movements and improve nutrient absorption.
* **Pharmacokinetics:** *Bacillus mesentericus*, being a spore-forming bacteria, survives the acidic stomach environment. Once in the intestines, the spores germinate, and the bacteria proliferate and colonize. It is not systemically absorbed and therefore its effect is primarily limited to the intestinal tract.  Elimination occurs mostly through feces.
* **Mode of Action:** *Bacillus mesentericus* inhibits the growth of pathogenic bacteria. It does this through both direct inhibition of growth and also by regulating abnormal bowel movements.  It is also studied for potential antimicrobial properties, which may be beneficial in certain infections.
* **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Specific receptor binding or enzyme inhibition by *Bacillus mesentericus* is not well-characterized.
* **Elimination Pathways:** *Bacillus mesentericus* is eliminated primarily through feces.

## **Dosage**


Dosage depends on the specific formulation and the patient's age and condition. The information provided here is for illustrative purposes and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 
Dosage for adults varies depending on the specific product used and can range from 1 million to 2 million CFU of Bacillus mesentericus per dose, usually taken 1 to 3 times daily. Multi-strain probiotics including Bacillus mesentericus may contain different CFU of the organism, with doses often ranging from 1 million - 2 million CFU.

#### **Children:**
Dosage for children should be determined by a pediatrician, based on age, weight, and the specific product used. One study used a dose of 2g/day of a probiotic mix containing *Bacillus mesentericus* in infants for two weeks.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage should be carefully considered in elderly patients due to potential age-related physiological changes. Consult a geriatrician for specialized advice.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Specific dose adjustments are not well-established. Caution is advised, and monitoring of renal function is recommended.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Similar to renal impairment, there is no specific information on dose adjustments.  Proceed with caution and monitor liver function.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consult a physician about potential drug interactions and necessary dose adjustments.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage for specific clinical situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations is determined on a case-by-case basis by the treating physician. No general recommendations are available.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustment recommendations are lacking due to limited clinical trials on *Bacillus mesentericus* as a single agent. Always refer to the specific product's instructions or consult a physician for dosage adjustments.
