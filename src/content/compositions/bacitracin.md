## **Usage**

Bacitracin, a polypeptide antibiotic, is primarily used topically to prevent and treat bacterial skin infections in minor cuts, scrapes, and burns.  It is effective against a range of gram-positive bacteria, including *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Streptococcus pyogenes*, and some gram-negative organisms.  Systemic use (intramuscular) is restricted to treating pneumonia and empyema caused by susceptible staphylococci in infants, particularly when less toxic alternatives are ineffective.  Its pharmacological classification is antibiotic. Bacitracin works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis.  It interferes with the dephosphorylation of a lipid pyrophosphate carrier molecule, preventing the transport of peptidoglycans across the cell membrane and disrupting cell wall construction.

## **Alternate Names**

Bacitracin is also referred to as bacitracin zinc.  Brand names include BACiiM and Baciguent.  Triple antibiotic ointments frequently combine bacitracin with neomycin and polymyxin B.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Bacitracin exhibits bactericidal (kills bacteria) or bacteriostatic (stops bacterial growth) properties. Its action depends on the drug's concentration and the organism's susceptibility. It primarily targets bacterial cell wall synthesis, preventing the incorporation of peptidoglycans, crucial components for cell wall integrity.  Bacitracin can also disrupt the bacterial plasma membrane, further contributing to its antimicrobial effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Topical application results in limited systemic absorption. Intramuscular administration, however, leads to rapid and complete absorption. The drug is widely distributed in body tissues and fluids. Bacitracin is eliminated primarily via renal excretion, with slow glomerular filtration.  Metabolism details, especially regarding CYP enzyme involvement, are limited.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Topical: Apply a thin layer to the affected area 1–3 times daily.  Treatment duration should not generally exceed seven days unless otherwise directed by a physician.  Ophthalmic ointment: Administer to the affected eye(s) every 3 or 4 hours (or as directed) for bacterial conjunctivitis, typically for 7–10 days.

#### **Children:**

Topical: Same as adult dosage. Ophthalmic: Same as adult dosage.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** For topical use, no specific dosage adjustments are recommended.  Systemic use should be carefully considered due to the risk of nephrotoxicity.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Systemic bacitracin is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment or failure due to the risk of nephrotoxicity.  Topical application on large skin areas should be done with caution.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for topical or ophthalmic use.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with concurrent medical conditions, particularly those affecting renal function.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Intramuscular bacitracin is not generally used in clinical settings outside of the specific indication for infant pneumonia and empyema.  Topical bacitracin can be used for minor skin infections following procedures such as intubation, surgical procedures, or while a patient is mechanically ventilated or in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Renal impairment necessitates careful consideration. Systemic bacitracin is avoided in these patients. With topical use, limit the area of application. Specific dosage adjustments based on metabolic disorders or genetic polymorphisms are not well-defined due to the primarily topical application.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Topical: Itching, rash, burning, or stinging at the application site. Ophthalmic: Blurred vision, eye irritation.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Systemic use: Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage) manifesting as changes in urine output, blood in the urine, or back pain. Allergic reactions: Severe skin reactions (hives, itching, swelling), breathing difficulties, anaphylaxis.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Contact dermatitis with prolonged topical application.  Bacterial resistance can emerge with excessive antibiotic use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Anaphylaxis, nephrotoxicity.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to bacitracin.  Systemic use is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment or failure.

## **Drug Interactions**

Systemic bacitracin can have additive nephrotoxic effects with other nephrotoxic agents like aminoglycosides (gentamicin, neomycin, kanamycin), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  Neuromuscular blocking agents may have prolonged effects with concurrent systemic bacitracin.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Topical bacitracin is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, limiting the application area is prudent. Systemic use should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, as safety data are limited.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis and can disrupt bacterial cell membranes.
* **Side Effects:** Topical: Itching, rash, burning, stinging. Systemic: Nephrotoxicity, allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to bacitracin, renal impairment (systemic use).
* **Drug Interactions:**  Nephrotoxic drugs (additive effects), neuromuscular blockers (prolonged blockade).
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Topical use is generally safe; systemic use should be avoided unless essential.
* **Dosage:** Topical: Apply 1–3 times daily. Ophthalmic: Apply every 3–4 hours. Systemic (infants): 900–1000 units/kg/day IM divided.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function (with systemic use).

## **Popular Combinations**

Bacitracin is frequently combined with neomycin and polymyxin B in topical triple antibiotic ointments to broaden the spectrum of antibacterial coverage.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess for prior hypersensitivity.  Avoid contact with eyes (except for ophthalmic formulations).  Monitor for allergic reactions.
* **Specific Populations:**
    * **Pregnant Women:** Topical use is generally safe.
    * **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Topical use is generally safe.
    * **Children & Elderly:** Safe for topical use as directed.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** No specific lifestyle restrictions are typically necessary with topical use.
