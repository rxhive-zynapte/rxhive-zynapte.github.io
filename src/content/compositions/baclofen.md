## **Usage**

Baclofen is primarily prescribed for the management of spasticity resulting from multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injuries, and other spinal cord diseases.  It is classified as a skeletal muscle relaxant and acts as a central nervous system depressant. Baclofen's mechanism of action involves inhibiting the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, leading to reduced muscle tone and spasm frequency.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Baclofen" is the generic name, it is marketed under various brand names, including Lioresal, Gablofen, Ozobax, and Fleqsuvy.


## **How It Works**

### Pharmacodynamics

Baclofen acts primarily on GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors in the spinal cord. By activating these receptors, it inhibits both monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes, leading to a decrease in muscle tone and spasticity.  The precise cellular mechanism involves increased potassium conductance and decreased calcium influx in presynaptic terminals, which reduces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters like glutamate and aspartate.

### Pharmacokinetics

Baclofen is readily absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1-2 hours. It has a relatively low protein binding capacity and is widely distributed throughout the body.  The liver minimally metabolizes baclofen, and it is primarily excreted unchanged through the kidneys. The elimination half-life is typically 2-4 hours, requiring multiple daily doses.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Initial:** 5 mg orally three times a day for 3 days.
* **Titration:** Increase by 5 mg every 3 days as tolerated.
* **Maintenance:** 20-80 mg daily, divided into 3-4 doses. The maximum recommended daily dose is 80 mg.

#### **Children (12 years and older):**

Follow adult dosing guidelines, starting with a low dose and titrating cautiously.

#### **Children (under 12 years):**

Dosage must be determined by a physician based on weight and individual needs.



#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose (e.g., 5 mg twice daily) and titrate cautiously due to increased sensitivity to side effects. Monitor renal function closely.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce the dose and monitor closely for toxicity. Dose adjustments should be based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, although significant dose adjustments are typically not necessary due to minimal hepatic metabolism. Monitor for adverse events.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Carefully assess potential drug interactions and adjust dosage as needed, particularly in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or other conditions requiring concomitant medications.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Baclofen's oral formulation is not typically employed for acute management in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Intrathecal baclofen administration is preferred for severe spasticity unresponsive to oral therapy.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are necessary for patients with renal impairment, with adjustments based on creatinine clearance. Close monitoring for adverse events is essential in these patients.  For elderly patients, initiate therapy with a low dose and titrate gradually, observing closely for increased sensitivity to side effects.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, fatigue, headache, nausea, constipation, insomnia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Seizures, hallucinations, confusion, respiratory depression, hypotension, urinary retention, allergic reactions (e.g., hives, dyspnea, angioedema).


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Tolerance may develop with prolonged use, requiring dosage adjustments. Withdrawal symptoms (seizures, hallucinations, hyperthermia) can occur with abrupt discontinuation.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), CNS depression, paradoxical worsening of spasticity, rhabdomyolysis.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to baclofen, intrathecal administration of oral formulations. Use caution in patients with epilepsy, psychotic disorders, stroke, Parkinson's disease, renal impairment.

## **Drug Interactions**

CNS depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids), tricyclic antidepressants, MAO inhibitors, antihypertensives. Monitor for additive sedative effects and potential for respiratory depression or hypotension.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category:  Not assigned (FDA).  Baclofen crosses the placenta, and while animal studies showed adverse effects at high doses, human data is limited. Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus. Baclofen is excreted in breast milk in small amounts. Monitor infants for potential side effects like drowsiness, feeding difficulties, and hypotonia.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonist, leading to decreased excitatory neurotransmitter release and reduced muscle spasticity.
* **Side Effects:** Drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, confusion, nausea, seizures (rare), hallucinations (rare).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, intrathecal administration of oral formulation.
* **Drug Interactions:** CNS depressants, tricyclic antidepressants, MAOIs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution; monitor infant.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 20-80 mg/day divided; Children (12+):  Same as adult; Children (<12):  Physician-determined.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, mental status, respiratory rate, blood pressure.

## **Popular Combinations**

Baclofen is sometimes combined with physical therapy and other rehabilitation strategies for managing spasticity.

## **Precautions**

Pre-screening for renal dysfunction, epilepsy, psychiatric disorders. Avoid abrupt discontinuation. Caution in elderly patients and those operating machinery.  Inform patients about potential drug and alcohol interactions.
