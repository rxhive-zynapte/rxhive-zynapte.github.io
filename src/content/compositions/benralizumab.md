## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Benralizumab is prescribed as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma in adult and pediatric patients (6 years and older) inadequately controlled despite high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β-agonists.  It is also indicated for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) in adults.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Monoclonal antibody (anti-IL-5), immunomodulator.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Benralizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that directly binds to the interleukin-5 receptor alpha subunit (IL-5Rα) on eosinophils. This binding leads to antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and apoptosis (programmed cell death) of eosinophils, effectively reducing their numbers in the blood and airways. Eosinophils are key inflammatory cells in asthma and EGPA pathophysiology.


## **Alternate Names**

- **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Benralizumab
- **Brand Name:** Fasenra


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** By depleting eosinophils, benralizumab reduces airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness, leading to improved asthma control and a decrease in exacerbation frequency. In EGPA, it reduces organ damage associated with eosinophilic inflammation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Following subcutaneous administration, benralizumab exhibits dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. Absorption is relatively slow, with a half-life of approximately 3.6 days. Absolute bioavailability is estimated to be around 58%.
    - **Metabolism:** As a monoclonal antibody, benralizumab is primarily eliminated through catabolism into small peptides and amino acids, similar to endogenous IgG.  It is not metabolized by CYP450 enzymes.
    - **Elimination:** Benralizumab clearance is not dependent on renal or hepatic function.

- **Mode of Action:** Binds with high affinity to the IL-5Rα on the surface of eosinophils. This binding triggers ADCC, primarily mediated by natural killer (NK) cells, and also induces direct apoptosis of eosinophils. 
- **Receptor Binding:**  Specifically targets the IL-5Rα.

- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily by catabolism into small peptides and amino acids; not dependent on renal or hepatic pathways.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 30 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses, then every 8 weeks thereafter.

#### **Children (6 to 11 years):** Dose is based on body weight. Prescribing information should be consulted for specific pediatric dosing guidance.

#### **Children and Adolescents (12 years and older):** Same as adult dosing.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific dose adjustments are generally recommended. However, clinical judgment should be used based on the patient's individual circumstances.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Benralizumab is not indicated for:

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations** (e.g., status asthmaticus, cardiac arrest)


### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific dosage adjustments are required for renal or hepatic impairment, elderly patients, or specific comorbid conditions.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Headache, pharyngitis (sore throat), fever, injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling, itching), fatigue, hypersensitivity reactions (rash, urticaria).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Anaphylaxis, angioedema.

### **Long-Term Effects:**
Limited long-term data are available. Ongoing studies are evaluating the long-term safety profile of benralizumab.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Anaphylaxis, angioedema, severe hypersensitivity reactions.



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to benralizumab or any of its components.


## **Drug Interactions**

Limited clinical data are available on drug interactions with benralizumab. Some potential interactions have been identified, primarily with other immunomodulators.  Consult a comprehensive drug interaction resource for the most up-to-date information.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Limited data available. Monoclonal antibodies cross the placenta, especially during the third trimester. Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. A pregnancy exposure registry is available.
- **Breastfeeding:**  It is unknown if benralizumab is excreted in human milk.  Consider the benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother's need for the drug.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  IL-5Rα-directed cytolytic monoclonal antibody, depletes eosinophils.
- **Side Effects:** Headache, pharyngitis, injection site reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylaxis (rare).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to benralizumab.
- **Drug Interactions:** Limited data available.  Refer to a drug interaction resource.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Limited data in pregnancy; unknown if excreted in breast milk.
- **Dosage:** 30 mg SC q4weeks x 3 doses, then q8weeks.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Eosinophil counts, asthma control, adverse events.


## **Popular Combinations**

Benralizumab is typically used as add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists. It is not usually combined with other biologics for asthma.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Monitor for hypersensitivity reactions, especially after the first dose.  Screen for parasitic infections before starting therapy.
- **Specific Populations:** See Pregnancy and Breastfeeding sections.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** No specific lifestyle considerations are generally associated with benralizumab therapy.
