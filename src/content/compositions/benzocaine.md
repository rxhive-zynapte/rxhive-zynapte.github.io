## **Usage**

Benzocaine is a local anesthetic (topical) used to relieve pain and itching caused by conditions such as mouth sores, sore throat, canker sores, teething pain, minor burns, sunburn, insect bites or stings, poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, minor cuts, or scratches.  It belongs to the pharmacological class of local anesthetics, specifically ester local anesthetics. Benzocaine works by reversibly stabilizing the neuronal membrane, which decreases its permeability to sodium ions. This action blocks nerve impulse initiation and conduction, leading to a localized numbing effect.


## **Alternate Names**

Benzocaine is also known as ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.  Brand names include Anbesol, Baby Orajel, Cepacol, Dermoplast, Hurricaine, Orabase, Orajel, Solarcaine, Topicaine, and others.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Benzocaine acts by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels on neuronal membranes. This inhibits the depolarization necessary for nerve impulse transmission, preventing pain signals from reaching the central nervous system.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Benzocaine is poorly absorbed through intact skin. Absorption is significantly increased through mucous membranes or broken skin.
* **Metabolism:**  Primarily metabolized in the plasma and, to a lesser extent, in the liver by cholinesterase through hydrolysis.
* **Elimination:** Excreted in the urine as metabolites.

**Mode of Action:** Benzocaine binds to the intracellular portion of voltage-gated sodium channels, stabilizing them in their inactive state. This prevents sodium influx into the neuron, hindering depolarization and subsequent nerve impulse propagation.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Benzocaine's primary mechanism is sodium channel blockade. It does not directly bind to receptors, inhibit enzymes, or modulate neurotransmitters.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of metabolites after plasma and hepatic hydrolysis.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Topical application of a 5-20% concentration, 3-4 times daily, as needed. For lozenges, 1 lozenge dissolved slowly in the mouth every 2 hours as needed (generally, use less than 2 days).  For sprays, apply 1-3 sprays to the affected area, up to 4 times daily.

#### **Children:** Use in children younger than 2 years of age is generally not recommended due to the risk of methemoglobinemia. For children 2 years and older, dosage should be determined by a healthcare professional and is typically lower than adult doses. Lozenges are typically for children 5 years and older.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients**:  Use with caution due to increased risk of methemoglobinemia. Monitor for signs and symptoms.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment**: No specific dosage adjustments are typically necessary but caution is advised.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**:  No specific dosage adjustments are typically necessary but caution is advised.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Use with caution in patients with asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, or heart disease due to an increased risk of methemoglobinemia.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Benzocaine is not typically used in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  It is primarily used for topical pain relief.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on patient-specific factors, including age, weight, the affected area's size, and the specific condition being treated. Always follow the advice of a healthcare professional.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Mild stinging, burning, or itching at the application site; skin tenderness; redness of the skin; dry white flakes where the medicine was applied.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Methemoglobinemia (manifested by cyanosis, headache, fatigue, confusion, rapid heart rate, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, pale, blue, or gray skin); allergic reactions (hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat).

### **Long-Term Effects**

No specific long-term effects have been documented with topical benzocaine use, but prolonged use should be avoided unless under the supervision of a physician.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Methemoglobinemia is a serious ADR that requires immediate medical intervention.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to benzocaine or other ester-type local anesthetics; secondary bacterial infection of the treated area; children under 2 years of age (for certain formulations); application to large areas of broken or damaged skin.



## **Drug Interactions**

Benzocaine may interact with sulfonamides, potentially antagonizing their therapeutic effect. Anticholinesterases may inhibit benzocaine metabolism. Certain medications can increase the risk of methemoglobinemia when combined with benzocaine (e.g., dapsone, nitrates, other oxidizing agents).



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category: C. Animal studies have not been reported.  Benzocaine is generally considered safe for topical use during pregnancy when used as directed and only if clearly needed. Avoid applying benzocaine to the breasts or nipples during breastfeeding, as infants may ingest the drug and develop methemoglobinemia.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Blocks voltage-gated sodium channels, inhibiting nerve impulse transmission.
* **Side Effects:** Stinging, burning, itching, redness, methemoglobinemia (rare but serious).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, secondary bacterial infection, certain age groups.
* **Drug Interactions:** Sulfonamides, anticholinesterases, oxidizing agents.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category C; avoid applying to breasts/nipples.
* **Dosage:** 5-20% topical application, 3-4 times daily.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Observe for signs of methemoglobinemia.


## **Popular Combinations**

Benzocaine is often combined with menthol in topical preparations for enhanced pain relief and a cooling sensation.


## **Precautions**

Pre-screen for allergies to benzocaine or PABA. Avoid use in infants under 2 years old (for certain formulations).  Use with caution in the elderly and individuals with asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, or heart disease.
