      How does Betahistine work?**


      **A:** Betahistine improves inner ear microcirculation primarily through
      H1 agonism and H3 antagonism. This increases blood flow in the stria
      vascularis and reduces endolymphatic pressure, thereby relieving symptoms
      of Ménière's disease.

## **Usage**

- Betahistine is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic treatment of Ménière's disease.  Ménière's disease is characterized by a triad of symptoms: vertigo (often accompanied by nausea and vomiting), tinnitus (ringing or buzzing in the ears), and hearing loss (fluctuating and sensorineural).
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Histamine analogue/Histamine H3 receptor antagonist/Histamine H1 receptor agonist.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Betahistine improves microcirculation in the inner ear by acting as a partial H1 receptor agonist and an H3 receptor antagonist. This increases blood flow to the stria vascularis and reduces endolymphatic pressure, which is thought to be responsible for the symptoms of Ménière's disease.

## **Alternate Names**

- Betahistine dihydrochloride
- **Brand Names:** Serc, Betaserc, Hiserk

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Betahistine acts as a partial agonist at H1 receptors, leading to vasodilation and increased blood flow in the inner ear.  It also acts as an antagonist at H3 receptors, reducing histamine release and further contributing to improved inner ear blood flow.  It also appears to have agonistic effects at H3 receptors in the vestibular nuclei. These actions collectively help to alleviate the symptoms of Ménière's disease.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Betahistine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1-3 hours. It is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily to 2-pyridylacetic acid (2-PAA).  Excretion is mainly through the kidneys, with the majority being excreted within 24 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Betahistine primarily acts on histamine receptors in the inner ear and the brainstem. It has an agonistic effect on the H1 receptor, which causes blood vessel dilation and subsequently improves blood circulation in the stria vascularis. Betahistine has an antagonistic effect on the H3 receptor, which inhibits the regulation of histamine in the central and autonomic nervous systems. This dual effect helps to reduce endolymphatic pressure and improve the symptoms of Ménière's disease. 
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** H1 receptor agonism, H3 receptor antagonism. 
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion, with rapid metabolism to 2-PAA in the liver.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The usual starting dose is 8-16 mg taken three times a day, preferably with meals. The dose can be adjusted based on individual response, up to a maximum of 48 mg per day. Tablets can be halved for more precise dosing if available.

#### **Children:**

- Betahistine is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  While limited clinical trial data exists, post-marketing experience suggests that dose adjustments are generally not necessary in elderly patients. However, caution should be exercised, especially in patients with comorbidities.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustments are outlined in the available information, but caution is recommended due to primary renal excretion.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments are outlined in the available information, but caution is recommended as betahistine is metabolized in the liver.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with peptic ulcer disease, asthma, or a history of allergic skin conditions. Patients with phaeochromocytoma should not take betahistine.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Betahistine is not indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It is specifically indicated for Ménière's disease.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient response and tolerability. Considerations include renal function, hepatic function, and comorbidities.  Dosage should be titrated upwards starting from the lower end of the recommended range.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Headache, nausea, dyspepsia (indigestion), mild gastrointestinal upset.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (e.g., skin rash, itching, swelling), hypersensitivity reactions, severe hypotension.

### **Long-Term Effects**

No significant long-term side effects have been identified in the available resources.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Significant ADRs requiring immediate intervention are rare but may include severe allergic reactions and severe hypotension.


## **Contraindications**

- Phaeochromocytoma
- Hypersensitivity to betahistine or any of its components.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Antihistamines may antagonize the effects of betahistine.
- Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) should be used with caution as they may potentiate the effects of betahistine.
- No clinically significant interactions with commonly prescribed medications (e.g., antibiotics, anticoagulants, antihypertensives), OTC drugs, supplements, or food are listed within the provided source material. 

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** The safety of betahistine during pregnancy has not been established. Use only if clearly needed and under the supervision of a physician.
- **Breastfeeding:** It is unknown whether betahistine passes into breast milk.  Use with caution during breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Improves inner ear microcirculation through H1 agonism and H3 antagonism.
- **Side Effects:**  Headache, nausea, dyspepsia.
- **Contraindications:** Phaeochromocytoma, hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:**  Antihistamines, MAOIs.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution.
- **Dosage:** 8-16 mg three times daily, up to 48 mg/day.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Vertigo frequency and severity, tinnitus intensity, hearing acuity.

## **Popular Combinations**

Limited information on specific drug combinations is available.  Some studies have mentioned combination with diuretics to manage fluid balance. Clinically, betahistine may be used with other symptom management medications (antiemetics and anti-nausea medicine).

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess for history of peptic ulcer disease, asthma, or allergic conditions.  Monitor blood pressure.
- **Specific Populations:** Caution in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Not recommended in children under 18. Use caution in the elderly.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:**  May cause drowsiness; caution with driving or operating machinery until effects are known.
