## **Usage**

Bethanechol is prescribed for the treatment of urinary retention (difficulty urinating) that may occur postoperatively, postpartum, or due to neurogenic bladder atony. It belongs to the pharmacological classification of *cholinergic agonists* or *parasympathomimetics*, specifically a *muscarinic agonist*. It mimics the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. This action stimulates detrusor muscle contraction and bladder emptying.  Bethanechol increases the tone of the detrusor urinae muscle, facilitating bladder emptying.

## **Alternate Names**

Bethanechol is also known as bethanechol chloride. Brand names include Urecholine, Duvoid, and Myotonachol.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Bethanechol primarily stimulates muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts. This results in increased detrusor muscle tone and contractions, facilitating bladder emptying. In the GI tract, it increases motility and secretions.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Well-absorbed orally, though less effectively than by subcutaneous administration. Taking it on an empty stomach enhances absorption.
* **Metabolism:**  Minimal hepatic metabolism. It is not metabolized by CYP enzymes.
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.

**Mode of Action:** Bethanechol binds directly to muscarinic cholinergic receptors (M2 and M3 subtypes) on the detrusor muscle of the bladder, activating them. This leads to increased phosphoinositide turnover, release of intracellular calcium, and ultimately smooth muscle contraction, causing bladder emptying. It does not inhibit acetylcholinesterase.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral:** 10-50 mg three or four times a day. The initial dose is 5–10 mg, which can be repeated hourly until a satisfactory response or up to a maximum single dose of 50 mg.
* **Subcutaneous:** 2.5–5 mg three or four times daily. It is crucial to administer bethanechol subcutaneously; intravenous or intramuscular routes are contraindicated due to potential serious adverse effects.

#### **Children:**
* **Oral:** 0.3–0.6 mg/kg/day divided three to four times a day.  It is generally recommended to administer the dose 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals to minimize gastrointestinal upset. Maximum dose is 0.4 mg/kg or 10 mg per dose. Safety and efficacy have not been fully established in the pediatric population. It is typically given for GERD treatment or for cases of urinary retention. The use of bethanechol in pediatrics is considered off-label in some cases.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and titrate cautiously, monitoring for side effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are indicated in the manufacturer's labeling.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are indicated in the manufacturer's labeling, although the metabolic disposition of bethanechol is not fully understood.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with asthma, peptic ulcer disease, hyperthyroidism, hypotension, bradycardia, coronary artery disease, epilepsy, Parkinsonism, and recent bladder surgery.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Bethanechol does not have approved or recommended dosages for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It is primarily used for urinary retention.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments might be needed in patients with pre-existing conditions or taking interacting medications.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Abdominal cramps/pain
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Increased salivation
* Increased urination
* Flushing

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Hypotension
* Bradycardia
* Bronchospasm/asthmatic attacks
* Seizures (rare)


### **Long-Term Effects**

No specific long-term side effects have been identified, but prolonged use may exacerbate underlying conditions like peptic ulcers or asthma.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs include severe hypotension, bronchospasm, and allergic reactions.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to bethanechol

* **Cholinesterase inhibitors:** Additive cholinergic effects (e.g., donepezil, galantamine).
* **Beta-blockers:** Increased risk of bradycardia and hypotension.
* **Procainamide, quinidine:** May enhance cholinergic effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (animal studies show adverse effects, but there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women).  Use only if clearly needed, weighing the potential benefits against the potential risks.
* **Breastfeeding:** Unknown if excreted in breast milk. Use with caution and monitor infants for cholinergic effects (diarrhea, increased tearing, excessive salivation, or urination).

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonist.
* **Side Effects:**  Abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, increased salivation/urination, flushing, sweating, headache, dizziness. Rarely: hypotension, bronchospasm, seizures.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer, asthma, bradycardia, hypotension, CAD, epilepsy, parkinsonism, GI/GU obstruction, recent bladder surgery.
* **Drug Interactions:** Anticholinergics, cholinesterase inhibitors, beta-blockers.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category C; use with caution. Excretion in breast milk unknown.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 10–50 mg PO TID/QID or 2.5-5 mg SC TID/QID.  Pediatrics: 0.3-0.6 mg/kg/day divided TID/QID (off-label).
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory status, urinary output.


## **Popular Combinations**

Bethanechol is not typically used in combination with other medications, and no specific drug combinations are recommended in standard clinical practice.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess for allergies,  contraindications, and potential drug interactions before initiating therapy.
* **Specific Populations:**  Caution in elderly, pregnant/breastfeeding women, and children.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid alcohol due to increased risk of drowsiness.
