## **Usage**

Bilastine is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (both seasonal and perennial) and urticaria (hives).  It falls under the pharmacological classification of second-generation antihistamines.  Bilastine works by selectively blocking peripheral histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors. This action inhibits the effects of histamine, a chemical mediator released during allergic reactions, thereby reducing allergy symptoms.

## **Alternate Names**

While "bilastine" is the established generic name, it's marketed under various brand names, including Blexten, Bilaxten, and Ilaxten.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Bilastine exerts its therapeutic effect by selectively antagonizing peripheral H<sub>1</sub> receptors. It doesn't bind to muscarinic receptors and demonstrates limited penetration into the central nervous system, resulting in a lower risk of sedation compared to first-generation antihistamines.  

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Bilastine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) in approximately 1.13 hours.  Food and fruit juices, especially grapefruit juice, can reduce its bioavailability.
* **Metabolism:** Bilastine undergoes minimal metabolism in the liver.
* **Elimination:** It is primarily eliminated unchanged through feces (approximately 67%) and urine (approximately 33%), predominantly via renal clearance. The mean elimination half-life is around 14.5 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing.

**Mode of Action:** Bilastine acts as a competitive antagonist at peripheral H<sub>1</sub> receptors. It binds to these receptors, preventing histamine from binding and triggering the downstream cascade that leads to allergic symptoms.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The standard dose for adults and adolescents 12 years and older is 20 mg (one tablet) once daily.

#### **Children:**
* **6-11 years (weighing at least 20 kg):** 10 mg once daily, available as an orodispersible tablet or oral solution.
* **Under 6 years:** The safety and efficacy have not been established for children under 6.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is needed.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is required as bilastine isn't extensively metabolized in the liver.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific dose adjustments mentioned for other diseases.

### **Clinical Use Cases:**

Bilastine is not indicated for use in situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary indication is for managing allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, abdominal pain, dry mouth, fatigue.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), QT prolongation, torsades de pointes (rare).

### **Long-Term Effects:**
No specific long-term adverse effects have been identified.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to bilastine.
* History of QT prolongation or torsades de pointes, including congenital long QT syndrome.

## **Drug Interactions**

Bilastine may interact with:

* **P-glycoprotein Inhibitors:** (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin, cyclosporine, ritonavir, diltiazem) can increase bilastine plasma levels.
* **Grapefruit juice and other fruit juices:** May decrease bioavailability of bilastine.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Limited data available; use with caution and only if clearly needed.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Excretion in human breast milk is unknown; not recommended during breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Selective peripheral H<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist.
* **Side Effects:** Headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, abdominal pain, dry mouth, and fatigue. Rarely QT prolongation and torsades de pointes.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to bilastine, history of QT prolongation or torsades de pointes.
* **Drug Interactions:** P-glycoprotein inhibitors, grapefruit juice.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution in pregnancy; not recommended while breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** Adults and adolescents ≥12 years: 20 mg once daily. Children 6-11 years (≥20 kg): 10 mg once daily.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for any signs of hypersensitivity reactions or cardiac effects, especially in patients at risk for QT prolongation.

## **Popular Combinations:**

No commonly recommended or specific combination therapies are available for Bilastine. 

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess for hypersensitivity, renal or hepatic impairment, and concomitant medications.
* **Pregnant Women and Breastfeeding Mothers:**  Use cautiously or avoid during pregnancy and avoid during breastfeeding.
