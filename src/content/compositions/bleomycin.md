## **Usage**

Bleomycin is an anti-neoplastic medication used to treat several types of cancer, including:

* Squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck, skin, penis, cervix, and vulva
* Hodgkin's lymphoma
* Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
* Testicular cancer
* Malignant pleural effusions (as a sclerosing agent)

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Antineoplastic agent, specifically a glycopeptide antibiotic with cytotoxic properties.

**Mechanism of Action:** Bleomycin exerts its antineoplastic effects primarily by causing DNA strand breaks and inhibiting DNA synthesis. It also appears to chelate metal ions, potentially contributing to its cytotoxic activity.


## **Alternate Names**

Bleomycin sulfate.

**Brand Names:** Blenoxane, Bleo 15k.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Bleomycin's primary mechanism of action involves binding to DNA and inducing single- and double-strand breaks, preventing cell replication.  It does not appear to significantly affect RNA or protein synthesis.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Absorption varies depending on the route of administration. Intravenous administration results in rapid and complete systemic availability. Intramuscular and subcutaneous routes show good absorption. Intrapleural administration leads to partial systemic absorption (around 45%).
* **Metabolism:**  Bleomycin is metabolized minimally, primarily by a hydrolase enzyme, bleomycin hydrolase, which is present in various tissues but at lower concentrations in the skin and lungs.  
* **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion (60-70% as unchanged drug), hence dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal impairment.  A small amount might be excreted in breastmilk.


**Mode of Action:** Bleomycin binds to DNA, leading to free radical formation, ultimately causing DNA fragmentation and inhibiting DNA synthesis.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Bleomycin's main action is direct DNA damage; it does not primarily act through receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion, with a small amount of metabolism via the bleomycin hydrolase.


## **Dosage**

Bleomycin dosing is complex and requires careful consideration of patient-specific factors.  Consult current protocols and guidelines for detailed information and appropriate regimen.  Dosing is expressed in International Units (IU) or sometimes in units (U).  1 mg is approximately equivalent to 1 IU or 1 U.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Squamous cell carcinoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, testicular carcinoma:** 0.25 to 0.5 units/kg (10 to 20 units/m²) IV, IM, or SC weekly or twice weekly.
* **Hodgkin's Disease:** Similar to above, followed by a maintenance dose of 1 unit daily or 5 units weekly IV or IM after 50% response.
* **Malignant Pleural Effusion:** 60 units in 50-100 mL of normal saline as a single intrapleural instillation.  May repeat at intervals if fluid reaccumulates.

#### **Children:**  Not recommended for pediatric use due to limited safety and efficacy data. Use only in exceptional circumstances at specialized facilities, adapting adult dosing based on body surface area.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients (≥60 years):** Reduce the total cumulative dose due to increased risk of pulmonary toxicity.  Specific adjustments are based on age (see below).
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Adjust the dosage based on creatinine clearance.  Significant dose reduction is needed for creatinine clearance <50 mL/min.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is typically necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider comorbid conditions such as pulmonary or cardiovascular disease, which may increase the risk of adverse events.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Bleomycin dosing in these settings should be guided by established clinical protocols:

* **Intubation:** Not specifically indicated for intubation.
* **Surgical Procedures:** Not typically administered during surgical procedures.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** No specific dosage adjustments related to mechanical ventilation.  Monitor for pulmonary toxicity, especially with high FiO2.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** No specific ICU dosing guidelines.  Close monitoring is essential.
* **Emergency Situations:** Not typically used in emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**
Adjustments based on renal function, age, and other clinical considerations are crucial.  Lifetime cumulative dose should generally not exceed 400 units due to the risk of pulmonary fibrosis. For elderly patients, adjust the total dose as follows:

* **≥80 years:**  100,000 IU total, 15,000 IU/week.
* **70-79 years:** 150,000 - 200,000 IU total, 30,000 IU/week.
* **60-69 years:** 200,000 - 300,000 IU total, 30,000 - 60,000 IU/week.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Fever and chills (approximately 50% of patients)
* Skin reactions (rash, hyperpigmentation, itching, nail changes)
* Mucositis/Stomatitis
* Anorexia and weight loss
* Nausea and vomiting
* Alopecia (hair loss)
* Pulmonary function changes


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Pulmonary fibrosis (potentially fatal)
* Anaphylactoid reactions (hypotension, confusion, wheezing, chills)
* Raynaud's phenomenon


### **Long-Term Effects**

* **Oxygen therapy and other drugs affecting pulmonary function:** Increased risk of pulmonary toxicity
* **Live vaccines:** Reduced vaccine efficacy and risk of infection
* **Phenytoin:** Reduced phenytoin absorption


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
