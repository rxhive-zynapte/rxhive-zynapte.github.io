## **Usage**

Borax, also known as sodium borate, sodium tetraborate, or disodium tetraborate, is primarily used as a household cleaner and pesticide.  While it has been used in some cosmetics and as an ingredient in making slime, these uses are now less common due to safety concerns. Medically, boric acid (a related compound) is sometimes used in vaginal suppositories to treat yeast infections. Borax itself does not have FDA-approved medical uses.  It's important to distinguish between borax (sodium tetraborate) and boric acid, which are related but have different chemical properties and toxicities.

It does not fit neatly into a single pharmacological classification. Its uses as a cleaning agent and pesticide are based on its chemical properties rather than a specific drug-like effect.  Boric acid, however, could be classified as an antiseptic/antifungal when used medically.

The mechanism of action of borax as a cleaning agent involves its alkaline pH, which helps to saponify fats and oils, making them easier to remove. As a pesticide, borax is thought to disrupt insect metabolism. Boric acid's antifungal properties are attributed to its ability to inhibit fungal growth.

## **Alternate Names**

- Sodium borate
- Sodium tetraborate
- Disodium tetraborate

There are many brand names for cleaning products containing borax, too numerous to list here.  It is crucial to consult the product label to determine the specific boron-containing compound and its concentration.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics (Borax):**  Borax is not typically ingested or administered in a way that produces systemic pharmacodynamic effects.  Its primary actions are chemical, related to its alkalinity and ability to react with certain substances.

**Pharmacokinetics (Borax):**  If ingested, borax is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract. It is excreted primarily by the kidneys.  Information on its metabolism is limited.  

**Pharmacodynamics (Boric Acid - when used medically):**  Boric acid exerts a local antiseptic and antifungal effect.  

**Pharmacokinetics (Boric Acid):**  When used vaginally, boric acid is absorbed to some degree. It is primarily excreted by the kidneys, with a half-life of approximately 20 hours.


## **Dosage**

Borax does not have standard medical dosages. Boric acid, however, is typically administered vaginally as a suppository for yeast infections (consult a healthcare professional for specific dosage information on Boric Acid). Due to potential toxicity concerns surrounding borax exposure, it is not recommended for internal use or application on skin without medical supervision. The provided sources highlight the importance of avoiding ingestion or unnecessary contact with borax, particularly in pregnant women, infants, and children.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects (Borax exposure):**

- Skin irritation (redness, itching, burning)
- Eye irritation
- Respiratory irritation (coughing, throat irritation)
- Nausea and vomiting (if ingested)
- Diarrhea (if ingested)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects (Borax exposure):**

- Kidney damage (high doses)
- Shock and death (high doses)
- Reproductive and developmental harm (high doses)

### **Long-Term Effects (Borax exposure):**

-  Hormonal disruptions (potential)
-  Male reproductive issues (potential)


## **Contraindications**

- Known hypersensitivity to borax
- Pregnancy (potential risk to the fetus)
- Breastfeeding (potential exposure to the infant)

## **Drug Interactions**

Limited data is available on specific drug interactions with borax.  However, it can react with certain metal salts. Consult a healthcare professional for any specific concerns regarding interactions with other medications.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Borax should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential risks to the fetus and infant.
