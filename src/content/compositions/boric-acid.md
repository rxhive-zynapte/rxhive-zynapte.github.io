## **Usage**

Boric acid is primarily prescribed for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (yeast infections), particularly cases that are recurrent or resistant to standard azole antifungal treatments. It also has mild antiseptic properties and is used in some topical preparations for minor skin infections or irritations.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antiseptic, antifungal.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Boric acid's exact mechanism of action against *Candida* species is not fully understood, but it's thought to disrupt cell membrane integrity and inhibit fungal growth. Its antiseptic properties stem from its weak acidic nature.

## **Alternate Names**

- Boracic acid
- Hydrogen borate
- Orthoboric acid
- Boricum acidum (homeopathic name)

Brand names vary depending on the formulation and country. Some examples include Hylafem pH (vaginal suppositories) and pH-D Feminine Health (vaginal suppositories).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Boric acid exerts fungistatic and mild antiseptic effects.  In vaginal applications, it helps restore the normal vaginal pH, creating an environment less conducive to *Candida* growth.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - *Absorption:* Vaginal absorption is minimal, resulting in low systemic exposure. Topical absorption through intact skin is also limited.
    - *Metabolism:* Boric acid is not significantly metabolized in the body.
    - *Elimination:* Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Elimination half-life ranges from 13-24 hours.

- **Mode of Action:**  Boric acid's antifungal action likely involves disruption of fungal cell membranes and interference with metabolic processes.  Its antiseptic action arises from its weak acidic nature.

- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  No significant interactions are known.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Vaginal Yeast Infections:** One 600 mg boric acid suppository inserted vaginally once daily, preferably at bedtime, for 14 days. For acute infections, a shorter course of 3-6 days might be sufficient. Some sources suggest lower doses (300mg) to reduce local irritation.

#### **Children:**

Boric acid is generally NOT recommended for children under 12 years of age unless specifically directed by a physician.  Pediatric dosing guidelines are not well-established and should be determined on a case-by-case basis by a doctor, considering the child's age, weight, and the specific condition being treated.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required for elderly patients, but caution is advised, especially in those with renal impairment.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be necessary due to reduced clearance. Close monitoring is essential.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific adjustments are usually required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider individual patient factors and comorbid conditions when determining the appropriate dosage and duration of treatment.


### **Clinical Use Cases:**

Boric acid is not typically used in the clinical settings of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary use is for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis.


### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments may be required based on patient-specific factors, including renal function, age, and the severity of the infection. Consult specialist literature and guidelines for detailed recommendations.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Vaginal burning or irritation
- Watery vaginal discharge
- Local skin reactions (redness, itching) with topical application


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions (hives, rash, swelling)
- Severe vaginal irritation or inflammation
- Systemic toxicity (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps) with significant absorption or ingestion, which can occur in cases of open vaginal sores or misuse.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic complications from prolonged vaginal use are rare but may include alterations in vaginal flora.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Clinically significant ADRs are rare but can include severe allergic reactions or systemic toxicity.  Prompt discontinuation and supportive care are essential.



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to boric acid
- Pregnancy
- Breastfeeding (consult doctor, limited data on safety)
- Open sores or wounds in the vaginal area
- Children under 12 years old (unless directed by a physician)


## **Drug Interactions**

Limited information on specific drug interactions is available.  Inform patients to disclose all medications, including OTC drugs and supplements, to their healthcare provider.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Contraindicated.  Boric acid can be toxic to the developing fetus.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Not recommended. Limited data exists on safety, potential transfer to breast milk, and effects on the nursing infant.




## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Disrupts fungal cell membrane integrity, inhibits fungal growth, restores vaginal pH.
- **Side Effects:** Vaginal irritation, watery discharge, local skin reactions.  Rarely, allergic reactions or systemic toxicity.
- **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, breastfeeding, hypersensitivity, open wounds in the vaginal area, children under 12.
- **Drug Interactions:** Limited data available.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy, not recommended during breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:**  600 mg vaginal suppository once daily for up to 14 days.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Resolution of symptoms, signs of local irritation or allergic reactions.


## **Popular Combinations:**

Boric acid is typically used alone for vaginal yeast infections.


## **Precautions**

- Ensure correct diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis before initiating treatment.
- Avoid use in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.
- Discontinue use if severe irritation or allergic reaction occurs.
- Keep out of reach of children.
