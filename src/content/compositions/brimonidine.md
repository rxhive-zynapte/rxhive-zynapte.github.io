      What is the recommended dosage for Brimonidine?**

      **A:** For adults with glaucoma or ocular hypertension: one drop in the
      affected eye(s) three times daily, approximately 8 hours apart.  For
      adults with ocular redness: one drop in the affected eye every 6 to 8
      hours (maximum 4 times/day).  Specific dosing for children and special
      populations should be determined by a physician.

## **Usage**

- Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution is prescribed for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. It is also used to relieve redness of the eye caused by minor eye irritations.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Brimonidine lowers IOP primarily by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow.

## **Alternate Names**

- Brimonidine tartrate
- **Brand Names:** Alphagan® P, Lumify™, Alphagan®

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Brimonidine binds to alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the eye, leading to decreased aqueous humor production and increased uveoscleral outflow, thus lowering IOP.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Brimonidine is absorbed through the cornea and conjunctiva.  Peak ocular hypotensive effect occurs approximately two hours after instillation. Systemic absorption is low. Metabolism occurs primarily in the liver, and elimination is mainly through renal excretion. 
- **Mode of Action:** Activation of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors.
- **Receptor Binding:** Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism with renal excretion.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

One drop in the affected eye(s) three times daily, approximately 8 hours apart (for glaucoma or ocular hypertension).
One drop in the affected eye every 6 to 8 hours, maximum 4 times/day (for redness of the eye).

#### **Children:**
- For glaucoma or ocular hypertension: Children 2 years of age and older: One drop in the affected eye 3 times a day, about 8 hours apart. Children younger than 2 years of age: Use is not recommended due to potential toxicity.
- For redness of the eye: Children 5 years of age and older: One drop in the affected eye every 6 to 8 hours. Children younger than 5 years of age: Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.



#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Use with caution. Close monitoring may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Close monitoring may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, depression, orthostatic hypotension, Raynaud's phenomenon, or thromboangiitis obliterans.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Brimonidine is not typically used in the clinical scenarios listed (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, Emergency Situations).  Its primary indication is for topical ophthalmic use in glaucoma and ocular hypertension.  Other medications are preferred for systemic sedation or in emergency/critical care settings.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Close monitoring is recommended in these patient populations.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Ocular: Blurred vision, burning/stinging, foreign body sensation, ocular hyperemia, pruritus, allergic conjunctivitis, conjunctival folliculosis.
- Systemic: Dry mouth, headache, fatigue, drowsiness, dizziness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Hypotension
- Bradycardia
- Apnea (in infants)
- Syncope


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Limited data is available on long-term effects, but chronic complications are uncommon with topical ocular use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to brimonidine or any component of the formulation.
- Neonates and infants (under 2 years of age).
- Patients receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor therapy.


## **Drug Interactions**

- CNS depressants (additive sedative effects)
- Antihypertensives/Cardiac glycosides (may potentiate hypotensive effects)
- Tricyclic antidepressants (may blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine)


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  C
- **Fetal Risks:** Use only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
- **Breastfeeding:** Not known if excreted in human milk. Exercise caution.  Consider potential risk to the nursing infant.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, decreases aqueous humor production and increases uveoscleral outflow.
- **Side Effects:** Ocular irritation, dry mouth, headache, fatigue.  Rarely: hypotension, bradycardia, apnea (infants).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, neonates/infants, MAO inhibitors.
- **Drug Interactions:** CNS depressants, antihypertensives, tricyclic antidepressants.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; potential fetal risk; unknown if excreted in human milk.
- **Dosage:**  One drop in affected eye(s) three times daily (glaucoma/ocular hypertension); One drop every 6-8 hours (ocular redness).
- **Monitoring Parameters:** IOP, heart rate, blood pressure.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Brimonidine/Timolol: Fixed combination for synergistic IOP lowering in glaucoma/ocular hypertension.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Monitor IOP, cardiovascular parameters, and for allergic reactions.
- **Specific Populations:** Use with caution in pregnant/breastfeeding women, children, and the elderly.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** May cause drowsiness; avoid driving or operating machinery if affected.
