## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Bromfenac ophthalmic solution is primarily prescribed for the treatment of postoperative ocular inflammation and reduction of ocular pain in patients who have undergone cataract surgery.  It can also be used to treat inflammation and pain after other eye surgeries.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID)
- **Mechanism of Action:** Bromfenac works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes, which are responsible for the production of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins contribute to inflammation and pain. By inhibiting COX enzymes, bromfenac reduces the production of these inflammatory mediators, thereby decreasing pain and inflammation in the eye.

## **Alternate Names**

- Bromfenac sodium
- **Brand Names:**  BromSite, Bromday, Prolensa, Xibrom, Yellox

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Bromfenac reduces ocular pain and inflammation by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.  The topical application minimizes systemic effects.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  
    - **Absorption:** When applied as eye drops, bromfenac is absorbed into the ocular tissues, achieving therapeutic concentrations in the aqueous humor. Systemic absorption is minimal, leading to low plasma concentrations.
    - **Metabolism:**  While the specific metabolic pathways of topical bromfenac are not fully elucidated, systemic bromfenac is primarily metabolized in the liver.
    - **Elimination:**  Systemic bromfenac is primarily excreted via the kidneys.  The elimination pathway of topical bromfenac is not definitively characterized.
- **Mode of Action:** Bromfenac binds to and inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, decreasing prostaglandin production.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion for systemically administered bromfenac; the elimination pathway of topical bromfenac is not well-defined.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- One drop in the affected eye(s) once daily (Prolensa, Bromday) or twice daily (BromSite, some generics), starting 1 day before cataract surgery, continued on the day of surgery, and for up to 14 days postoperatively.  Another regimen uses twice daily dosing starting the day *after* surgery for 14 days.
- Yellox is dosed twice daily *after* cataract extraction for up to 14 days.


#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients.  Use is generally avoided.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustments are typically necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Not specifically studied; caution advised.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Not specifically studied; caution advised.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution should be exercised in patients with diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, dry eye syndrome, bleeding disorders, asthma or sulfite allergy, or history of corneal issues or multiple eye surgeries.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation:** Not applicable.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Used primarily for cataract surgery; can be used after other ocular surgeries.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not applicable.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Not applicable.
- **Emergency Situations:** Not applicable.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dosage adjustments may be required based on patient-specific factors such as renal or hepatic dysfunction or other comorbidities, though limited data is available on these adjustments.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Increased sensitivity to light

- Patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma, rhinitis, or urticaria

## **Drug Interactions**

- **Other NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen):** Increased risk of bleeding
- **Anticoagulants/Antiplatelets (warfarin, clopidogrel):** Increased risk of bleeding
- **Corticosteroids:** May increase the risk of corneal adverse effects and slow down healing.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (0.07% and 0.09% solutions); Not assigned (0.075% solution). Not recommended during the third trimester. Use in the first and second trimesters only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk.
- **Fetal risks:** Potential for premature closure of ductus arteriosus.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Drug excretion in human milk unknown. Caution advised.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits COX-1 and COX-2, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and subsequent inflammation.
- **Side Effects:** Common: Increased light sensitivity, eye irritation. Serious: Corneal complications, bleeding.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to bromfenac or other NSAIDs, aspirin-sensitive asthma/rhinitis/urticaria.
- **Drug Interactions:** Other NSAIDs, anticoagulants, corticosteroids.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Not recommended in third trimester; caution advised if breastfeeding.

- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for signs of corneal complications, bleeding, or allergic reactions.

## **Popular Combinations**

-  Often used alone.  Concomitant use with other eye drops is possible but requires careful administration with adequate spacing between instillations (at least 5 minutes).

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Avoid contact of the dropper tip with any surface. Assess allergy history. Patients should not wear contact lenses during treatment.
- **Specific Populations:**  Use with caution in pregnant or breastfeeding women. Safety and efficacy in children not established. Use caution in the elderly and those with certain medical conditions.
