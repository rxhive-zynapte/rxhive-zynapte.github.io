## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Bromhexine is prescribed for respiratory disorders associated with productive cough, such as acute and chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, bronchiectasis, emphysema, and other conditions where mucus secretion is excessive or impaired.  It is a mucolytic agent, meaning it helps to thin and loosen mucus in the airways.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Mucolytic, expectorant.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Bromhexine works by breaking down the structure of mucopolysaccharides in the mucus, reducing its viscosity. This facilitates easier expectoration (coughing up) of phlegm and clears the airways. It may also stimulate the serous glands in the respiratory tract, increasing the volume of less viscous secretions, further aiding in mucus clearance.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:** Bisolvon is a common international nonproprietary name (INN).
- **Brand Names:** Bisolvon is a widely recognized brand name. Other brand names may vary depending on the region.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Bromhexine reduces mucus viscosity and increases its volume, thereby promoting mucociliary clearance in the respiratory tract. This leads to easier expectoration and relief from productive cough.  
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Bromhexine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration.
    - **Metabolism:** It undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver, primarily to ambroxol (an active metabolite).  
    - **Elimination:**  Bromhexine and its metabolites are mainly excreted in the urine. The elimination half-life can range from 6.6 to 31.4 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** At the molecular level, bromhexine depolymerizes mucopolysaccharide fibers in mucus, decreasing its viscosity. It does not directly bind to receptors or inhibit enzymes but alters the physical properties of mucus.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** No significant receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation has been observed.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion. It is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP enzymes, to various metabolites, including ambroxol.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Oral:** 8-16 mg three to four times daily. In some cases, the dose can be increased to 16 mg three times daily, especially during the first week of treatment.
- **Intravenous/Intramuscular:** 4mg two to three times a day.
- **Inhalation:** 4mg (2ml solution), diluted approximately 2.5 times with saline and inhaled three times daily.

#### **Children:**

- **Under 1 year:** 2 mg twice daily.
- **1-5 years:** 4 mg twice daily.
- **6-10 years:** 4 mg four times daily or 2.5-5ml syrup three times a day.
- **12-14 years and patients <50kg**: 24mg daily in three doses
- **12 years and older**: Adult dose

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be needed, considering age-related decline in organ function. Start with a low dose and adjust as necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be required for patients with severe renal dysfunction.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised in patients with severe liver disease. Dosage adjustments may be needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Adjust dosage according to the specific condition, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or asthma.

### **Clinical Use Cases:**

- **Intubation:** May be used to facilitate airway clearance prior to or after intubation.
- **Surgical Procedures:** May be used to prevent or treat postoperative pulmonary complications associated with impaired mucus secretion and transport.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Can be used to thin secretions in patients on mechanical ventilation to aid in suctioning.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** May be used for managing secretions in critically ill patients.
- **Emergency Situations:**  Not typically indicated for emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- Adjust dose based on patient-specific factors such as renal/hepatic impairment, metabolic disorders, and other relevant comorbid conditions.
- Consult with specialists for individualised dosage adjustments.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia (indigestion).
- Headache, dizziness.
- Skin rash, sweating.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis).
- Angioedema, anaphylaxis.
- Bronchospasm.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- No specific long-term effects have been commonly reported.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

-  Report any severe skin reactions or signs of allergic reaction immediately and discontinue use.
- Monitor liver function tests periodically.

## **Contraindications**

- Known hypersensitivity to bromhexine.
- Active gastric or duodenal ulcer (relative contraindication).
- Severe hepatic or renal impairment (use with caution and dose adjustment).
- Pregnancy, especially the first trimester (use only if clearly needed).
- Breastfeeding (bromhexine is excreted in breast milk).

## **Drug Interactions**

- **Antibiotics:**  Bromhexine may increase the concentration of antibiotics in bronchial secretions, potentially enhancing their efficacy in respiratory tract infections.
- **Other Medications:** No clinically significant interactions with commonly prescribed medications have been consistently reported. However, inform your healthcare provider about all concurrent medications to avoid potential interactions.
- **OTC Drugs and Supplements:** Consult your healthcare provider before combining bromhexine with other OTC medications or supplements, especially those with expectorant or antitussive properties.
- **Food and Lifestyle Factors:**  No specific food or lifestyle interactions have been documented.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Limited data are available on the safety of bromhexine during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester. Use only if potential benefits outweigh the risks.
- **Fetal Risks, Teratogenicity, and Developmental Concerns:**  Animal studies have not shown teratogenic effects, but there is insufficient data in pregnant women to assess fetal risk.
- **Drug Excretion in Breast Milk:** Bromhexine is excreted in breast milk.  Avoid use during breastfeeding due to the potential for adverse effects in the infant.
- **Alternative Safer Options:**  Discuss with a physician for alternative safer mucolytics if necessary during pregnancy or lactation.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Breaks down mucopolysaccharides, reducing mucus viscosity and promoting mucociliary clearance.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, skin rash. Rarely: severe skin reactions, angioedema, bronchospasm.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, active peptic ulcer, severe liver/kidney disease, pregnancy (especially first trimester), breastfeeding.
