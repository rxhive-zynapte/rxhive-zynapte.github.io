## **Usage**

Bromocriptine is prescribed for various medical conditions, including:

* **Hyperprolactinemia:** High levels of prolactin in the blood.
* **Acromegaly:** Excess growth hormone production.
* **Parkinson's Disease:**  A neurodegenerative disorder affecting movement.
* **Type 2 Diabetes:**  Sometimes used off-label.
* **Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome:** A rare but serious reaction to antipsychotic medications.
* **Suppression of postpartum lactation (for medical reasons):** When breastfeeding is not advisable.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Dopamine agonist.

**Mechanism of Action:** Bromocriptine mimics the action of dopamine, a neurotransmitter, in the brain.  It primarily activates dopamine D2 receptors, inhibiting prolactin secretion and improving motor control in Parkinson's disease.

## **Alternate Names**

* **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Bromocriptine
* **Brand Names:** Parlodel, Cycloset (for type 2 diabetes)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Bromocriptine's primary effect is dopamine receptor agonism, particularly at D2 receptors. This leads to:

* **Inhibition of Prolactin Release:**  Reduces prolactin levels, treating hyperprolactinemia-related conditions.
* **Improved Motor Control:** Restores dopamine balance in the brain, alleviating Parkinsonian symptoms.
* **Blood Sugar Regulation:**  May improve insulin sensitivity and glucose control (mechanism not fully understood).

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Well-absorbed orally, enhanced when taken with food.
* **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4.
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted in bile and feces; a small portion is eliminated renally.


**Mode of Action:** Bromocriptine binds to and activates dopamine D2 receptors, leading to downstream effects such as inhibition of prolactin release and modulation of neuronal activity in the basal ganglia (relevant to Parkinson's disease).


**Receptor Binding:** Primarily binds to dopamine D2 receptors.


**Elimination Pathways:** Hepatic metabolism (CYP3A4) followed by biliary excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Starting Dose:** Typically 1.25 mg to 2.5 mg once daily with food at bedtime.
* **Titration:** The dose can be gradually increased every 2â€“7 days based on the patient's response and tolerance.
* **Maintenance Dose:** Varies depending on the condition being treated, typically ranging from 2.5 mg to 30 mg per day, taken in divided doses with meals.
* **Maximum Dose:** Usually not more than 100 mg/day (lower for certain conditions, consult specific guidelines).

#### **Children (7-17 years):**

* **Prolactinomas:** 1 mg two or three times daily, gradually increasing as needed.
* **Maximum Dose:** 5 mg/day for children aged 7-12 years; 20 mg/day for adolescents aged 13-17 years.
* **Pediatric Endocrinology Specialist:** Should be involved in the management of children and adolescents receiving bromocriptine.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and titrate cautiously, considering age-related changes in organ function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary but no specific guidelines are available; careful monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment is likely needed due to reduced metabolism; close monitoring is essential.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized dosing based on the specific comorbidity.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Bromocriptine's dosage in these settings would generally follow the standard dosage guidelines, with adjustments as needed based on patient response and tolerance:

* **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not specifically indicated.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** No specific dosing adjustments unless related to existing conditions treated with bromocriptine.
