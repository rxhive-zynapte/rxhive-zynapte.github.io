## **Usage**

Budesonide is a corticosteroid prescribed for various inflammatory conditions. Its uses include:

*   **Asthma:** Controller medication for long-term management and prevention of asthma symptoms.  It's not used for acute asthma attacks.
*   **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD):**  Used in combination with formoterol to control and prevent COPD symptoms.
*   **Allergic Rhinitis:**  Nasal spray formulation used to relieve symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and congestion.
*   **Crohn's Disease:**  Used to induce and maintain remission in mild to moderate Crohn's disease affecting the ileum and ascending colon.
*   **Eosinophilic Esophagitis:**  Oral suspension or tablets are used to treat inflammation in the esophagus.
*   **Ulcerative Colitis:** Oral formulation used to induce remission.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Corticosteroid (Glucocorticoid)

**Mechanism of Action:** Budesonide acts by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm of cells. This complex then translocates to the nucleus and modulates gene transcription, leading to decreased inflammation. It works by suppressing the immune system, reducing inflammatory mediator production, and inhibiting inflammatory cell migration.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely used alternate names for budesonide itself, although many brand names exist depending on the formulation and country.

**Brand Names:** Pulmicort, Rhinocort, Entocort EC, Uceris, Tarpeyo, Symbicort (budesonide/formoterol), Breyna (budesonide/formoterol).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Budesonide exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors. This binding leads to:

*   **Decreased production of inflammatory mediators:**  Reduces the production of cytokines, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes.
*   **Inhibition of inflammatory cell migration:** Prevents the movement of neutrophils, eosinophils, and other inflammatory cells to the site of inflammation.
*   **Suppression of the immune system:** Reduces the activity of the immune system, lessening the inflammatory response.
*   **Decreased vascular permeability:**  Reduces leakage of fluid and proteins from blood vessels into the inflamed tissue.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  

*   **Absorption:**  Absorption varies depending on the route of administration.  Oral bioavailability is low due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Inhalation and intranasal routes have higher local bioavailability.
*   **Distribution:** Distributes widely throughout the body.
*   **Metabolism:**  Primarily metabolized by the liver via CYP3A4 enzymes.
*   **Elimination:**  Excreted mainly in the urine and feces as metabolites.


**Mode of Action:** Budesonide's action is primarily through genomic mechanisms, meaning it affects gene expression.  The drug binds to glucocorticoid receptors, leading to altered transcription of various genes involved in inflammation.

**Receptor Binding:** Budesonide binds with high affinity to glucocorticoid receptors.

**Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Does not have direct enzyme inhibitory effects, but can alter the expression of enzymes involved in inflammation. No direct neurotransmitter modulation actions.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4, followed by excretion in urine and feces.


## **Dosage**

Budesonide dosage varies widely depending on the condition being treated, the patient's age, and the formulation used. The following are general guidelines and not a substitute for physician judgment:

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   **Asthma (Inhalation):**  200-400 mcg twice daily initially, titrated up to 1600 mcg/day if needed. Maintenance doses usually range from 100-400 mcg twice daily.
*   **COPD (Inhalation with Formoterol):** 160/4.5 mcg two inhalations twice daily.
*   **Crohn's Disease (Oral):** 9 mg once daily in the morning for up to 8 weeks. Maintenance: 6 mg once daily for up to 3 months.
*   **Ulcerative Colitis (Oral):** 9 mg once daily in the morning for up to 8 weeks.
*   **Eosinophilic Esophagitis (Oral):** 1-2 mg twice daily, depending on the formulation.


#### **Children:**

*   **Asthma (Inhalation):** Starting dose depends on age and severity.  Nebulizer:  0.25-1 mg twice daily. Dry powder inhaler: 100-200 mcg twice daily.
*   **Croup (Nebulizer):**  Single dose of 2 mg, or two 1 mg doses 30 minutes apart. May repeat every 12 hours up to 36 hours.
*   **Crohn's Disease (Oral):**  9 mg once daily for up to 8 weeks for children over 8 years and weighing over 25 kg, followed by 6 mg once daily for two weeks.
*   **Eosinophilic Esophagitis (Oral):** Use and dose must be determined by a doctor for children under 11 years of age.


#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustment is typically required for inhaled budesonide.  However, other factors like comorbidities and organ function should be considered.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment needed for inhaled budesonide.  Oral budesonide should be used with caution.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Reduce oral budesonide dosage in moderate hepatic impairment. Contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.  No dosage adjustment usually needed for inhaled budesonide, but caution is advised.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments may be needed based on the specific comorbidity (e.g., diabetes, osteoporosis).


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Budesonide is not indicated for the clinical use cases listed (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations). It is not used in these acute situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments may be needed based on individual patient factors, including renal/hepatic function, concomitant medications (especially CYP3A4 inhibitors), and response to therapy.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   **Inhalation:** Headache, throat irritation, hoarseness, cough, oral candidiasis, respiratory infections.
*   **Oral/Rectal:** Headache, nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, back pain, gas, indigestion.
*   **Nasal:**  Nasal irritation, epistaxis, pharyngitis.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Adrenal suppression, growth retardation (in children), pneumonia, glaucoma, cataracts, hyperglycemia, immunosuppression.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

*   Osteoporosis, decreased bone mineral density, increased risk of infections.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

*   Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., rash, angioedema), paradoxical bronchospasm.



## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to budesonide.
*   Status asthmaticus (inhaled formulations).
