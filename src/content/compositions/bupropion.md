  - q: >-
      How should Bupropion be discontinued?**


      **A:**  Generally, it is recommended to gradually taper the dose of
      bupropion rather than abruptly discontinuing it, especially after
      prolonged use. This can help minimize potential withdrawal symptoms.  A
      specific tapering schedule should be individualized based on patient
      factors and clinical judgement.

## **Usage**

Bupropion is prescribed for:
- Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
- Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)
- Smoking Cessation (as an aid)
- Off-label uses include Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and sometimes in combination with mood stabilizers in patients with both ADHD and Bipolar Disorder.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Aminoketone antidepressant, atypical antidepressant.

**Mechanism of Action:** Bupropion's exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it is believed to work primarily through the inhibition of dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake, increasing their levels in the synaptic cleft. It also has some weak effect on serotonin reuptake inhibition and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonism.

## **Alternate Names**

**International and Regional Variations:**  Amfebutamone (previous name)

**Brand Names:** Wellbutrin, Wellbutrin SR, Wellbutrin XL, Aplenzin, Zyban, Buproban, Forfivo XL


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Bupropion's primary effect is to increase the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine, thereby improving mood, motivation, and energy levels. It also exhibits some nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonism, which may play a role in its effectiveness for smoking cessation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Well-absorbed orally, but the extent of absorption can be affected by food.
* **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2B6, to three active metabolites: hydroxybupropion, threohydrobupropion, and erythrohydrobupropion. These metabolites have longer half-lives than the parent drug and contribute to its clinical effects.
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted in the urine, with small amounts eliminated in the feces.
* **Half-life:** Bupropion's half-life is approximately 10-20 hours, depending on the formulation and metabolism. However, its active metabolites have significantly longer half-lives. 

**Mode of Action:**  Bupropion inhibits the dopamine transporter (DAT) and the norepinephrine transporter (NET), preventing their reuptake into the presynaptic neuron. This increases the concentration of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft, leading to enhanced postsynaptic signaling. Bupropion also appears to be a non-competitive antagonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, reducing cravings and withdrawal symptoms associated with nicotine dependence.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Primarily DAT and NET inhibition, with some weak nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonism. Weak effects on the serotonin transporter (SERT). Metabolism involves CYP2B6.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Immediate-release (IR):** Initial: 100 mg twice daily. Increase after 3 days to 100 mg three times daily. Maximum dose: 450 mg/day (single doses not to exceed 150 mg).
* **Sustained-release (SR):** Initial: 150 mg once daily. Increase after 3 days to 150 mg twice daily. Maximum dose: 400 mg/day (single doses not to exceed 200 mg).
* **Extended-release (XL):** Initial: 150 mg once daily. Increase after 4 days to 300 mg once daily. Maximum dose: 450 mg/day.  A 450 mg XL formulation is available for patients already titrated to 300 mg/day of another formulation.
* **Aplenzin (hydrobromide):**  Initial: 174 mg once daily. Increase after 7 days to 348 mg once daily. Maximum dose: 522 mg/day.

#### **Children (off-label use for ADHD):** Initial: 3 mg/kg/day in divided doses. Titrate gradually to a maximum of 6 mg/kg/day or 300 mg/day (whichever is less). Single doses should not exceed 150 mg. Monitor closely for side effects.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and titrate more slowly due to potential age-related changes in drug clearance.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce dose and/or frequency.  450 mg XL is not recommended.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Reduce dose and/or frequency depending on severity. Consult product information for specific recommendations based on Child-Pugh score and formulation.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with a history of seizures, eating disorders, or those undergoing abrupt discontinuation of alcohol or other CNS depressants.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Bupropion is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU.  It is primarily used for the outpatient treatment of depression, SAD, and smoking cessation.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient factors such as:

* Renal or hepatic impairment
* Age
* Concomitant medications (especially CYP2B6 inhibitors/inducers)
* Tolerance and side effects
* Therapeutic response


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term side effects are generally similar to the common side effects. There is a potential for weight changes (either gain or loss) with prolonged use.

* **Levodopa and amantadine:** Increased risk of adverse effects.
* **Nicotine replacement therapy:**  May increase blood pressure.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
