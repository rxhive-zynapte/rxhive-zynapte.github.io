      What is the role of Buserelin in assisted reproduction?**


      **A:**  Buserelin is used to suppress the natural production of LH and
      FSH, allowing for controlled ovarian stimulation with exogenous
      gonadotropins. This helps prevent premature ovulation and improves the
      chances of successful IVF.

## **Usage**

- Buserelin is primarily prescribed for hormone-responsive conditions like prostate cancer, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and central precocious puberty. It's also used in assisted reproduction for female infertility.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Buserelin initially stimulates the pituitary gland to release gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)). However, continuous administration leads to downregulation of GnRH receptors, resulting in suppressed LH and FSH release, effectively creating a hypogonadal state (similar to castration).  This reduces the production of sex hormones like testosterone and estrogen.

## **Alternate Names**

- Suprefact
- Suprecur

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Buserelin mimics the action of GnRH, initially causing a surge in LH and FSH. Chronic administration desensitizes the pituitary gland, suppressing gonadotropin and sex hormone production. This effect leads to reduced growth of hormone-dependent tissues like prostate tissue in prostate cancer and endometrial tissue in endometriosis.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Varies depending on the route of administration. Subcutaneous injection has high bioavailability (around 70%), while nasal administration has lower bioavailability (1-3%).
    - **Metabolism:**  Metabolized by peptidases in the liver, kidneys, GI tract, and pituitary gland.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through renal excretion, with some biliary excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Prostate Cancer (Subcutaneous):** 500 mcg three times daily for one week, followed by 200 mcg once daily.
- **Endometriosis (Nasal):** 150 mcg/spray into each nostril three times daily.  Treatment duration is typically six months but can extend up to nine months.
- **Ovulation Induction (Subcutaneous/Intranasal):** 200-500 mcg daily, adjusted according to individual patient response.  Up to 500 mcg twice daily may be necessary. Once pituitary downregulation is achieved (serum estradiol < 180 pmol/L and progesterone < 3 nmol/L), gonadotropin stimulation is initiated alongside continued Buserelin administration.

#### **Children (Central Precocious Puberty):**

- **Nasal:**  Initial dose of 1200 mcg/day, divided into several administrations. The dose may be adjusted or switched to subcutaneous administration as needed.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Close monitoring recommended due to increased risk of adverse effects. Dose adjustments may be needed.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Careful monitoring is necessary. Dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance may be required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Close monitoring is necessary; dose adjustment might be required.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Buserelin is primarily used in outpatient or specialist clinic settings, not typically in acute care situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or emergency situations. Its use is centered around managing chronic conditions like prostate cancer and endometriosis or in assisted reproduction.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Hot flashes
- Decreased libido
- Vaginal dryness
- Mood changes
- Headache
- Injection site reactions (pain, swelling, itching)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions (rash, breathing difficulties, swelling)
- Pituitary apoplexy
- Osteoporosis (with long-term use)
- Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (in women undergoing assisted reproduction)


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to buserelin or GnRH analogues.
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding.
- Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding.
- Non-hormone-dependent prostate cancer.
- Prior orchiectomy (surgical removal of testicles).

## **Drug Interactions**

- Drugs that affect pituitary or gonadal function.
- Concomitant use with hormonal contraceptives can diminish the efficacy of Buserelin.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** X (contraindicated).
- Buserelin is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of fetal harm.
- Breastfeeding is contraindicated as Buserelin passes into breast milk.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** GnRH agonist, initially stimulating and then suppressing gonadotropin and sex hormone release.
- **Side Effects:** Hot flashes, decreased libido, mood changes, headache, injection site reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, pregnancy, breastfeeding, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding.
- **Drug Interactions:** Drugs affecting pituitary or gonadal function.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.

## **Popular Combinations**

- In assisted reproduction, Buserelin is used in combination with gonadotropins (FSH and LH) for ovulation induction.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Assess for allergies and pre-existing conditions.  Confirm negative pregnancy test before initiating treatment in women of reproductive age.
- **Specific Populations:**  Caution is advised in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  Buserelin is contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding.
