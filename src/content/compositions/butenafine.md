## **Usage**

Butenafine is a broad-spectrum antifungal medication primarily prescribed for the topical treatment of superficial fungal infections of the skin. These infections include:

* **Tinea pedis (athlete's foot):** Affecting the skin between and around the toes.
* **Tinea cruris (jock itch):**  Affecting the groin area.
* **Tinea corporis (ringworm):** Affecting the body (excluding scalp, groin, hands, and feet).
* **Tinea versicolor (pityriasis versicolor):**  A common fungal infection causing discolored patches of skin.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Butenafine is classified as an allylamine antifungal agent.

**Mechanism of Action:** Butenafine inhibits squalene epoxidase, a crucial enzyme in fungal ergosterol biosynthesis. Ergosterol is an essential component of fungal cell membranes. By inhibiting squalene epoxidase, butenafine disrupts ergosterol production, leading to increased cell membrane permeability and ultimately fungal cell death.


## **Alternate Names**

Butenafine hydrochloride is the chemical name.  There are no widely recognized international or regional variations of the name.

**Brand Names:** Butenafine is marketed under various brand names including:

* Lotrimin Ultra
* Mentax


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Butenafine exerts fungicidal activity by targeting squalene epoxidase, a key enzyme in the fungal ergosterol biosynthesis pathway.  This inhibition leads to squalene accumulation and ergosterol deficiency, disrupting the integrity of the fungal cell membrane and causing cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Minimal systemic absorption occurs following topical application.
* **Metabolism:**  Butenafine is metabolized in the liver primarily via hydroxylation.
* **Elimination:** Excretion is biphasic, with a half-life of approximately 35 hours (alpha phase) and over 150 hours (beta phase). Primarily excreted through urine and faeces.

**Mode of Action:**  Butenafine specifically targets squalene epoxidase, a crucial enzyme responsible for converting squalene to squalene epoxide, a critical step in ergosterol biosynthesis. This inhibition leads to the accumulation of squalene and depletion of ergosterol within the fungal cell membrane, compromising membrane structure and function, resulting in cell death.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, Neurotransmitter Modulation:** The primary mechanism of action involves the highly selective and potent inhibition of squalene epoxidase. There is no evidence of direct receptor binding or neurotransmitter modulation.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism followed by renal and faecal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Tinea corporis/cruris:** Apply a thin layer of 1% cream once daily for 1-3 weeks or until clinical resolution.
* **Tinea pedis:** Apply to affected skin between and around toes twice daily for 1 week or once daily for 4 weeks.
* **Tinea versicolor:** Apply a thin layer of 1% cream once daily for 2 weeks.

#### **Children:**

* Safety and efficacy in children under 12 years of age have not been established.
* Children 12 years and older:  Same as adult dosing.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustment is generally required.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustment is typically necessary due to minimal systemic absorption.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustment is generally required due to minimal systemic absorption.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific recommendations exist; clinical judgment is advised based on individual patient conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Butenafine is indicated solely for topical treatment of superficial mycoses; it has no role in systemic infections and is not applicable in settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Generally, no dosage adjustments are necessary for elderly patients, renal impairment, or hepatic dysfunction.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Burning or stinging sensation
* Itching

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe burning, stinging, or irritation after using butenafine should prompt discontinuation and medical evaluation.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

No specific long-term side effects have been reported.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe skin reactions are rare but necessitate immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

* **Fetal risks, teratogenicity, and developmental concerns:**  Limited data are available. Use during pregnancy only if clearly needed and after careful risk-benefit assessment.
* **Drug excretion in breast milk and potential neonatal side effects:** It is unknown whether butenafine is excreted in breast milk. Consult a healthcare professional if breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibition of squalene epoxidase, leading to fungal cell death.
* **Side Effects:**  Burning/stinging, itching, erythema, contact dermatitis (rare).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to butenafine.
* **Drug Interactions:** No significant interactions reported.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution. Category C.
* **Dosage:**  Apply topically once or twice daily, as indicated by the specific infection.
