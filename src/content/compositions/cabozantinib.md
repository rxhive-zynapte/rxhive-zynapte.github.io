## **Usage**

Cabozantinib is prescribed for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and medullary thyroid cancer (MTC).  It is classified as a kinase inhibitor, specifically a multikinase inhibitor, targeting  receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, MET, AXL, RET, KIT, and TIE2.  The mechanism of action involves inhibiting these RTKs, which play a crucial role in tumor growth, angiogenesis (blood vessel formation), and metastasis.

## **Alternate Names**

Cabozantinib is marketed under the brand names Cabometyx (tablets) and Cometriq (capsules).

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cabozantinib exerts its anti-cancer effects by inhibiting multiple RTKs involved in tumor growth and progression.  This inhibition leads to a decrease in tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastatic potential.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Cabozantinib is absorbed orally, with food increasing its absorption.  It's recommended to take the medication at least one hour before or two hours after a meal.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4, with minor contributions from CYP1A2 and CYP2C9.
* **Elimination:** Excreted primarily via feces, with a small portion eliminated in urine. The half-life ranges from 55 to 99 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing.

**Mode of Action:** Cabozantinib binds to the ATP-binding pockets of target RTKs, preventing phosphorylation and activation, thereby disrupting downstream signaling pathways essential for tumor growth and spread.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Cabozantinib acts as a competitive inhibitor of the target RTKs.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Predominantly hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4, with fecal excretion as the primary route of elimination.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **RCC (Cabometyx):** 60 mg orally once daily.  For combination therapy with nivolumab, 40 mg orally once daily.
* **HCC (Cabometyx):** 60 mg orally once daily.
* **MTC (Cometriq):** 140 mg orally once daily (as capsules).
* **DTC (Cabometyx):** 60 mg orally once daily for BSA ≥ 1.2 m<sup>2</sup>. 40 mg orally once daily for BSA < 1.2 m<sup>2</sup>.

#### **Children:**

* **DTC (Cabometyx):**  For patients 12 years and older, dosing is based on BSA as mentioned above. Use in children younger than 12 years has not been established. For other indications, use and dose must be determined by the doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustment is recommended, but caution is advised due to potential age-related decline in organ function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in mild or moderate renal impairment. Not recommended in severe renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No dose adjustment is needed for mild impairment.  For moderate impairment (Child-Pugh B), reduce the dose to 40 mg once daily.  Avoid use in severe impairment (Child-Pugh C).
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Exercise caution in patients with hypertension, cardiac conditions, history of bleeding, or GI issues.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Cabozantinib is not typically used in the context of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest. Its primary use is in the targeted therapy of specific cancers as outlined above.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be required due to adverse events or drug interactions. Common dose reductions are to 40 mg daily and then to 20 mg daily or 20 mg every other day, depending on tolerability.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Diarrhea, fatigue, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE), decreased appetite, hypertension, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, constipation.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Hemorrhage, GI perforations, fistulas, thrombotic events, hypertensive crisis, hepatotoxicity, adrenal insufficiency, proteinuria, osteonecrosis of the jaw, impaired wound healing, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), hypocalcemia.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Potential long-term effects include chronic complications related to the above-mentioned rare but serious side effects.  Reduced fertility has also been observed.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any of the rare but serious side effects mentioned above constitute clinically significant ADRs requiring immediate intervention.


## **Contraindications**

No absolute contraindications. Relative contraindications include severe hepatic impairment, recent history of severe hemorrhage, and pregnancy.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** Co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin) can increase cabozantinib exposure. Dose adjustments may be necessary.
* **CYP3A4 Inducers:** Co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine) can decrease cabozantinib exposure and potentially reduce efficacy.
* **Other Interactions:**  Avoid concomitant use with St. John’s wort.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Pregnancy category D (Australia); not assigned (US FDA), based on evidence suggesting potential fetal harm.  Cabozantinib can cause fetal harm and is contraindicated during pregnancy.  Effective contraception is essential during and for at least 4 months after treatment.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Cabozantinib may be excreted in breast milk.  Breastfeeding is contraindicated during and for at least 4 months after treatment.
