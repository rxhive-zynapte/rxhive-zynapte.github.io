## **Usage**

Calcitonin is primarily prescribed for the following medical conditions:

*   **Paget's Disease of Bone:**  A chronic bone disorder characterized by excessive bone breakdown and disorganized bone formation. Calcitonin helps to regulate bone turnover, reducing bone pain and other symptoms.
*   **Postmenopausal Osteoporosis:** Calcitonin can help slow bone loss in women after menopause, reducing the risk of fractures.
*   **Hypercalcemia:**  A condition marked by elevated calcium levels in the blood. Calcitonin helps lower blood calcium levels.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Calcitonin is classified as an antiresorptive agent, specifically a calcitonin.

**Mechanism of Action:** Calcitonin primarily works by inhibiting osteoclast activity. Osteoclasts are cells responsible for breaking down bone tissue. By suppressing their activity, calcitonin reduces bone resorption and helps stabilize bone metabolism.

## **Alternate Names**

*   **Calcitonin-salmon (synthetic form commonly used)**
*   **Miacalcin (brand name)**
*   **Fortical (brand name)**

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Calcitonin binds to calcitonin receptors on osteoclasts, directly inhibiting their bone-resorbing activity. This leads to a decrease in serum calcium levels and a reduction in bone turnover markers. Calcitonin also increases renal excretion of calcium, phosphate, and other electrolytes.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Well absorbed after subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) injection. Nasal spray absorption is variable.
*   **Metabolism:**  Metabolized primarily in the kidneys.
*   **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion.

**Mode of Action:** Calcitonin interacts with specific receptors on the surface of osteoclasts. This binding triggers intracellular signaling cascades that reduce osteoclast activity and promote their apoptosis (programmed cell death).


**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily eliminated through renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   **Paget's Disease:** 100 IU SC/IM daily or 50 IU twice daily. Maintenance: 50-100 IU every 1-3 days. Nasal spray: 200 IU daily, alternating nostrils.
*   **Postmenopausal Osteoporosis:** 100 IU SC/IM every other day. Nasal spray: 200 IU daily, alternating nostrils.
*   **Hypercalcemia:**  Initial dose: 4 IU/kg SC/IM every 12 hours. May increase to 8 IU/kg every 12 hours, or up to 8 IU/kg every 6 hours in severe cases.

#### **Children:** Use and dosage must be determined by a doctor, considering the potential risks to bone growth and development. Calcitonin is generally not recommended for pediatric use.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dose adjustments based on age are required.  However, careful monitoring for side effects is recommended.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary in patients with severe renal impairment due to decreased clearance.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments are necessary.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor carefully for interactions with other medications or underlying medical conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

*   The clinical use cases primarily revolve around the treatment of Paget's disease, postmenopausal osteoporosis, and hypercalcemia. 
*   Calcitonin is not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU care, or emergency situations outside of hypercalcemic crisis management.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary based on patient response, renal function, and other individual factors.  Monitor serum calcium levels, bone turnover markers, and potential side effects to guide dose adjustments.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Flushing
*   Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling)
*   Nasal irritation (with nasal spray)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
*   Hypocalcemia (low blood calcium)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

*   Increased risk of malignancies with prolonged use (especially with nasal spray)


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

*   Anaphylaxis
*   Severe hypocalcemia

## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to calcitonin-salmon
*   Hypocalcemia

## **Drug Interactions**

*   Lithium: Calcitonin may reduce lithium levels.
*   Cardiac glycosides (e.g., digoxin): Dosage adjustments may be needed.
*   Calcium channel blockers:  Dosage adjustments may be needed.
*   Bisphosphonates: Additive calcium-lowering effect possible.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

*   **Pregnancy:** Limited data available.  Use only if clearly needed and potential benefit outweighs risk.
*   **Breastfeeding:** Calcitonin is present in breast milk, but infant absorption is likely limited.  Not recommended during breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits osteoclast activity, reduces bone resorption, and increases renal calcium excretion.
*   **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, flushing, injection site reactions, nasal irritation, allergic reactions, hypocalcemia.
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, hypocalcemia.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Lithium, cardiac glycosides, calcium channel blockers, bisphosphonates.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; not recommended during breastfeeding.
*   **Dosage:** Varies depending on condition; see Dosage section.
*   **Monitoring Parameters:** Serum calcium levels, bone turnover markers.

## **Popular Combinations**

Calcitonin is sometimes used in combination with calcium and vitamin D supplementation, particularly in the treatment of osteoporosis.

## **Precautions**

*   Perform skin testing before initiating therapy in patients with suspected hypersensitivity.
*   Monitor for allergic reactions, especially during initial doses.
*   Monitor serum calcium levels periodically.
*   Limit treatment duration to minimize the risk of malignancies.
