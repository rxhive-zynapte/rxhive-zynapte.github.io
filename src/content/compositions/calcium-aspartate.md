## **Usage**

Calcium aspartate is primarily prescribed for the treatment and prevention of hypocalcemia (low calcium levels in the blood). It is also used as a calcium supplement in conditions like osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and during periods of increased calcium demand such as growth, pregnancy, and lactation.

It is classified as a mineral supplement.

Its mechanism of action involves providing a source of calcium that can be readily absorbed by the body to restore or maintain normal calcium levels.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for calcium aspartate. However, it may sometimes be referred to as calcium L-aspartate hydrate. Brand names may vary depending on the region and manufacturer.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Calcium is crucial for various physiological functions, including nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, bone formation, and blood clotting. Aspartate is an amino acid that may enhance calcium absorption.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Calcium aspartate is administered orally and absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract.  Absorption can be influenced by factors such as vitamin D levels, gastric pH, and the presence of certain foods. Calcium is primarily excreted by the kidneys.  Aspartate is metabolized in the body.

**Mode of Action:** Calcium aspartate dissociates into calcium and aspartate ions. Calcium ions then participate in various cellular processes, including muscle contraction, nerve transmission, and bone mineralization.  

**Elimination pathways:** Calcium is excreted mainly through the kidneys, with a small amount lost through the feces and sweat. Aspartate, being an amino acid, undergoes metabolism within the body.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard adult dosage is typically 1.2 g of calcium aspartate per day, divided into 2 or 3 doses.

#### **Children:**

Dosage in children should be determined by a pediatrician and based on the child's age, weight, and clinical condition.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal function.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is necessary in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advised, though specific dose adjustments might not be routinely required.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustment may be needed depending on the specific comorbid conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Specific dosage guidelines for clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not universally established and should be determined on a case-by-case basis by the attending physician.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be required based on individual patient factors such as renal or hepatic dysfunction and other underlying health conditions.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Constipation, bloating, gas, nausea, and stomach upset.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), hypercalcemia (high calcium levels), cardiac arrhythmias (in susceptible individuals).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Potential long-term effects of chronic high calcium intake include kidney stones and cardiovascular issues.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe hypercalcemia requiring urgent medical attention.



## **Contraindications**

Hypercalcemia, severe renal failure, renal calculi (kidney stones), hypersensitivity to calcium aspartate.


## **Drug Interactions**

Calcium can interact with certain medications, including some antibiotics (tetracyclines, quinolones), bisphosphonates, levothyroxine, and thiazide diuretics.  It can also interact with certain foods. Concomitant administration of iron supplements may reduce the absorption of both calcium and iron. Alcohol consumption may influence calcium metabolism.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Calcium aspartate is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding when used within the recommended dosage range. Adequate calcium intake is essential for both maternal and fetal health during pregnancy and lactation.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Provides supplemental calcium, essential for numerous physiological functions.

* **Side Effects:** Constipation, bloating, gas, nausea, hypercalcemia (rarely).

* **Contraindications:** Hypercalcemia, severe renal failure, renal calculi.

* **Drug Interactions:** Tetracyclines, quinolones, bisphosphonates, levothyroxine.

* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe within recommended doses.

* **Dosage:** Adults: 1.2g/day divided into 2-3 doses. Pediatric: As per pediatrician's recommendation.

* **Monitoring Parameters:** Serum calcium levels, renal function tests.


## **Popular Combinations**

Calcium aspartate is often combined with vitamin D to enhance calcium absorption.


## **Precautions**

Patients with a history of kidney stones or renal impairment should be closely monitored. Serum calcium levels should be regularly checked, especially during long-term therapy.  Dietary sources of calcium and other medications containing calcium should be considered when determining the appropriate dose of calcium aspartate.
