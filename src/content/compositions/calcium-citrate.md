      How is calcium citrate different from intravenous calcium?**


      **A:** Calcium citrate is an oral supplement used for chronic calcium
      deficiency, while intravenous calcium (e.g., calcium gluconate or calcium
      chloride) is utilized for acute hypocalcemia requiring immediate
      correction.

## **Usage**

Calcium citrate is primarily prescribed to prevent or treat hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels) in individuals with insufficient dietary calcium intake. It is also used to manage conditions resulting from hypocalcemia, including:

*   Osteoporosis (bone loss)
*   Osteomalacia/rickets (weak bones)
*   Hypoparathyroidism (decreased parathyroid gland activity)
*   Latent tetany (a specific muscle disease)

It's also prescribed to ensure adequate calcium intake in specific populations like pregnant or breastfeeding women, postmenopausal women, and individuals taking certain medications (e.g., phenytoin, phenobarbital, or prednisone).  Calcium citrate may help prevent renal calculi formation by binding oxalate in the gut.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Calcium supplement, mineral supplement

**Mechanism of Action:**  Calcium is essential for various physiological processes, including nerve and muscle function, bone health, and blood clotting. Calcium citrate provides a readily absorbable source of calcium, increasing serum calcium levels and mitigating the effects of hypocalcemia.



## **Alternate Names**

Calcium citrate is sometimes referred to as tricalcium dicitrate.

**Brand Names:** Citracal, Caltrate, Os-Cal, Oysco, Cal-Cee, Cal-C-Cap, Cooper CompleteÂ® Calcium Citrate.



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Calcium is a crucial component of bone structure and plays a vital role in nerve transmission, muscle contraction, and blood coagulation. It also acts as a cofactor for various enzymes. Calcium citrate supplementation replenishes calcium stores, improving bone mineral density and supporting normal physiological functions.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Calcium citrate is absorbed in the small intestine, enhanced by the presence of food.
*   **Metabolism:** It doesn't undergo significant metabolism.
*   **Elimination:** Calcium is primarily excreted renally (through the kidneys) with some fecal elimination.

**Mode of Action:** Calcium influences cellular processes by modulating ion channels, acting as a second messenger, and interacting with calcium-binding proteins like calmodulin. It doesn't typically involve receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or direct neurotransmitter modulation.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily renal excretion.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   RDA: 1000 mg/day (19-50 years); 1200 mg/day (women > 50 years and men > 70 years); 1000 mg/day (men 51-70 years).
*   Hypocalcemia prevention: 1000 mg/day in divided doses.
*   Osteoporosis prevention: 1000-1500 mg/day in divided doses.

#### **Children:**

*   RDA: Varies by age (see sources).
*   Hypocalcemia: Neonates: 50-150 mg/kg/day divided every 4-6 hours (max 1g/day); Children: 45-65 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:**  May require higher doses due to reduced absorption.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance is essential. Close monitoring of calcium levels is needed.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific adjustments are typically needed.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consult product information.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Calcium citrate is generally not indicated for acute medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Intravenous calcium gluconate or calcium chloride is preferred in these settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage modifications might be required for renal impairment, certain malabsorption syndromes, or concomitant medications that affect calcium metabolism.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Constipation, upset stomach, gas, belching


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium), nausea/vomiting, loss of appetite, weight loss, mental/mood changes, bone/muscle pain, headache, increased thirst/urination, weakness, fatigue, allergic reactions (rash, itching, hives, swelling)


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Kidney stones (with excessive intake), milk-alkali syndrome (with very high, chronic dosing)

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe hypercalcemia requiring medical intervention, allergic reactions.



## **Contraindications**

*   Hypercalcemia
*   Hypercalciuria
*   Severe renal impairment
*   Kidney stones (history)
*   Hypersensitivity to calcium citrate or any components
*   Ventricular fibrillation
*   Hypophosphatemia


## **Drug Interactions**

Calcium citrate can decrease the absorption of several medications, including:

*   Bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate)
*   Tetracycline antibiotics (e.g., doxycycline, minocycline)
*   Quinolone antibiotics (e.g., ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin)
*   Levothyroxine
*   Digoxin
*   Eltrombopag

Concurrent use with thiazide diuretics can increase the risk of hypercalcemia.  Calcium citrate may also interact with certain phosphate binders and cellulose sodium phosphate. Consult a drug interaction checker for detailed information. Separate doses of interacting medications as far as possible from calcium citrate administration.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category:  Generally considered safe during pregnancy when used as directed; however, excessive intake should be avoided.

Calcium citrate appears in breast milk and is considered safe during breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** Provides supplemental calcium for various physiological processes.
*   **Side Effects:** Constipation, upset stomach, hypercalcemia (rarely).
*   **Contraindications:** Hypercalcemia, severe renal impairment, kidney stones.
*   **Drug Interactions:**  Several drug interactions, including antibiotics, levothyroxine, and digoxin.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe when used as directed.
*   **Dosage:**  Varies based on age, condition, and individual needs (see Dosage section).
*   **Monitoring Parameters:** Serum calcium levels, especially in patients with renal impairment.

## **Popular Combinations**

Calcium citrate is often combined with vitamin D to enhance calcium absorption.

## **Precautions**

*   Pre-existing conditions: Assess renal function and history of kidney stones.
*   Pregnant women: Monitor calcium levels to avoid excessive intake.
*   Breastfeeding mothers: Generally safe but monitor infant for constipation.
*   Children & elderly: Follow age-specific dosage recommendations.
