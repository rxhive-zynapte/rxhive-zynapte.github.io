## **Usage**

Calcium gluconate is prescribed for the treatment and prevention of hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels).  It is also used to treat conditions arising from calcium deficiency such as hypocalcemic tetany and hypoparathyroidism. Additionally, it is used in the management of hypermagnesemia (high blood magnesium levels) and hyperkalemia (high blood potassium levels), specifically for antagonizing cardiac toxicity in hyperkalemia. It can also be used in cardiac arrest due to hypermagnesemia, hyperkalemia or calcium channel blocker overdose and for hydrofluoric acid burns. Its pharmacological classification is as an electrolyte supplement and a mineral supplement. It works by directly providing a source of calcium to replenish depleted stores and restore normal physiological functions dependent on calcium.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely used alternate names for calcium gluconate. Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and region but commonly include names like Kalcium Glukonat and Calcium Sandoz.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Calcium plays a vital role in numerous physiological processes including nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, blood coagulation, and bone formation.  Calcium gluconate elevates serum calcium levels, correcting the deficit and alleviating symptoms of hypocalcemia like muscle spasms, tetany, and cardiac arrhythmias. In hyperkalemia, calcium stabilizes the cardiac cell membrane, protecting against the adverse effects of elevated potassium.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:**  Oral absorption is incomplete and variable, influenced by factors like vitamin D, pH, and dietary components. Intravenous administration delivers calcium directly into the bloodstream resulting in rapid action.
* **Metabolism:** Calcium is not metabolized in the conventional sense.
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted by the kidneys. Some calcium is eliminated in feces and through sweat.

**Mode of Action:** Calcium exerts its effects by binding to various proteins, including calcium-binding proteins like calmodulin, which regulate numerous enzymes and cellular processes. It also acts on cell membrane ion channels, influencing membrane excitability and neurotransmitter release.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** No specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation has been attributed to calcium gluconate as its action involves replenishing calcium, a ubiquitous ion crucial for numerous physiological functions.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Hypocalcemia:**  IV bolus: 1-2 g (10-20 mL of a 10% solution) over 10-20 minutes. This may be repeated every 10-60 minutes until symptoms resolve. Continuous IV infusion: Initiate at 5.4 to 21.5 mg/kg/hour. 
* **Hyperkalemia with ECG changes:** 1-3g IV over 2-5 minutes. Repeat dose every 5-10 minutes if ECG changes persist.
* **Hypermagnesemia:** 1-2g IV over 5-10 minutes.

#### **Children:**

* **Hypocalcemia:**  IV bolus: 50-200 mg/kg/dose (0.5 to 2 mL/kg/dose of a 10% solution), diluted to 50 mg/mL, administered over 30-60 minutes. Maintenance: 0.5-1.5 mmol/kg/day of elemental calcium.
* **Hyperkalemia:** 20-50 mg/kg/dose over 5-10 minutes.
* **Cardiac arrest:**  60-100 mg/kg/dose every 10 minutes (max 3000mg/dose)



#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Similar to adult dosing, but monitor closely due to potential for age-related decline in renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose reduction may be necessary; monitor calcium levels closely.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dose adjustments are generally not needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider underlying conditions and potential drug interactions when adjusting dosage.

### **Clinical Use Cases:**

* **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations:** Dosage adjusted based on the patient’s specific needs and clinical presentation of hypocalcemia. Monitor calcium levels closely and titrate the dose to effect.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Renal/Hepatic Dysfunction, Metabolic Disorders, or Genetic Polymorphisms:** Specific guidelines for dose adjustments are based on the severity of dysfunction and clinical response.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Constipation
* Bradycardia (with rapid administration)
* Local reactions at the injection site

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Cardiac arrhythmias

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term effects are uncommon with appropriate use but can include nephrocalcinosis with excessive oral intake.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe bradycardia or other cardiac arrhythmias, tissue necrosis with extravasation, and allergic reactions require immediate intervention.
