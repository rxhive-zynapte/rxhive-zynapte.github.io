      What is the recommended dosage for Calcium Leucovorin?**


      **A:** The dosage varies significantly based on the indication.  For
      leucovorin rescue after high-dose methotrexate, 10-15 mg/m² IV every 6
      hours for 10 doses is commonly used.  For megaloblastic anemia, up to 1 mg
      daily IM or IV is administered. In colorectal cancer, 200 mg/m² IV is
      commonly used with 5-FU. Always consult relevant protocols and adjust
      dosing based on patient factors.

## **Usage**

Calcium leucovorin, the calcium salt of folinic acid (also known as citrovorum factor), is prescribed for the following medical conditions:

* **Leucovorin Rescue:** Diminishing the toxicity and counteracting the effects of impaired methotrexate elimination and inadvertent overdosages of methotrexate and other folic acid antagonists. This is commonly used in high-dose methotrexate therapy for conditions like osteosarcoma.
* **Megaloblastic Anemia:** Treating megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible.  It is important to note that it's not effective for pernicious anemia or other megaloblastic anemias caused by vitamin B12 deficiency.
* **Advanced Colorectal Cancer:** Used in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in palliative treatment.
* **Overdosage of Folic Acid Antagonists:** Calcium folinate can be used to treat overdosages of folic acid antagonists like pyrimethamine or trimethoprim.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Antidote, vitamin, chemotherapeutic agent (in combination with 5-FU)

**Mechanism of Action:** Calcium leucovorin is a reduced folate, meaning it bypasses the metabolic step inhibited by methotrexate and other folate antagonists. This allows for continued synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, essential for DNA and RNA synthesis, thus rescuing normal cells from the toxic effects of the antifolate drugs. In combination with 5-fluorouracil, it enhances the cytotoxic effect by stabilizing the binding of 5-fluorouracil to its target enzyme, thymidylate synthase.



## **Alternate Names**

* Folinic acid
* Citrovorum factor

**Brand Names:**  Wellcovorin



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Calcium leucovorin readily enters cells and is converted to 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, the active form of folate needed for DNA and RNA synthesis. In colorectal cancer treatment, it enhances the binding of 5-fluorouracil to thymidylate synthase, thereby increasing its cytotoxic effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Rapidly absorbed following intramuscular (IM) and intravenous (IV) administration. Oral absorption is saturable and less efficient at higher doses.
* **Metabolism:** Converted to active metabolites, primarily 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, in the liver.
* **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion, with a small percentage eliminated in bile.

**Mode of Action:**  Calcium leucovorin is a reduced form of folic acid and bypasses the dihydrofolate reductase enzyme, which is inhibited by methotrexate and other antifolate drugs. It is readily converted to various cofactors essential for purine and thymidylate synthesis, allowing normal cells to continue DNA replication and other cellular processes even in the presence of folate antagonists. With 5-FU, it enhances cytotoxicity by stabilizing the complex of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, thymidylate synthase, and 5-fluorodeoxyuridylate, thereby potentiating the inhibition of thymidylate synthase.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Calcium leucovorin acts as a substrate for various enzymes involved in folate metabolism. It does not directly bind to receptors or modulate neurotransmitters. Its primary action is to overcome the effects of antifolate drugs by providing cells with the necessary reduced folates for metabolic processes. It enhances the inhibition of thymidylate synthase by 5-FU.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion, both as unchanged drug and metabolites. Some biliary excretion also occurs.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Leucovorin Rescue:** 10-15 mg/m² IV every 6 hours for 10 doses, starting 24 hours after the beginning of methotrexate infusion. Oral administration may be used after the first IV dose.  Dosage and duration may vary based on methotrexate levels.
* **Megaloblastic Anemia:** Up to 1 mg daily IM or IV. Oral dosages are typically 15 mg daily.
* **Advanced Colorectal Cancer (with 5-FU):** Various regimens exist, commonly involving 200 mg/m² IV infusion followed immediately by 5-fluorouracil.

#### **Children:**

Dosing is based on body surface area (BSA) and specific treatment protocols.  Pediatric dosages are generally calculated in mg/m² similarly to adult dosing.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary due to decreased renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction or increased dosing intervals may be required based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution should be exercised, although specific dose adjustments are not typically recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider potential drug interactions and adjust dosages accordingly.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage varies widely depending on the specific indication, clinical protocol, and patient factors. Please refer to the relevant protocol for specific recommendations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are made primarily based on renal function, methotrexate levels (in leucovorin rescue), and patient response. Close monitoring of renal function and serum methotrexate concentrations is crucial for safe and effective use.
