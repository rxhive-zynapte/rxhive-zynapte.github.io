## **Usage**

Calcium orotate is primarily prescribed to prevent or treat hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels) in individuals with insufficient dietary calcium intake.  It is also used to manage conditions arising from hypocalcemia, such as osteoporosis, osteomalacia/rickets, hypoparathyroidism, and latent tetany. It may be prescribed to specific populations with increased calcium needs, such as pregnant or breastfeeding women, postmenopausal women, and individuals taking medications like phenytoin, phenobarbital, or prednisone. It can be categorized as a mineral supplement. Calcium orotate helps transport calcium into cells, facilitating its absorption and utilization, especially in bone and cartilage tissue.

## **Alternate Names**

While "calcium orotate" is the standard generic name, sometimes combined with the orotate component. Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and geographical location.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Calcium is crucial for numerous physiological processes, including nerve and muscle function, bone health, and blood clotting.  Calcium orotate delivers calcium in a form that facilitates its absorption into cells.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Orotic acid, a natural metabolite, enhances calcium's transport across cell membranes.  This improves intracellular uptake, particularly in bone and cartilage.  Specific details on absorption, metabolism, and excretion of calcium orotate aren't readily available in the sources. The precise mechanism for enhanced absorption due to orotate isn't clearly established. General calcium elimination primarily occurs through renal excretion, with some fecal and sweat loss.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Standard dosage recommendations for calcium orotate range from 1-2 tablets daily, preferably with meals. The tablet strength often contains 740 mg calcium orotate, which provides around 100 mg of elemental calcium. This dosage might change depending on the individual's needs and the specific product.

#### **Children:**

Dosages for children haven't been established. It is essential to consult with a pediatrician before administering calcium orotate to children.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments are not typically necessary based solely on age, but consideration of coexisting conditions and renal function is important.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Exercise caution with severe renal impairment. Dose adjustments may be necessary, and close monitoring of calcium and phosphorus levels is essential.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage modifications are mentioned for hepatic impairment, but general caution is warranted.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider individual patient factors like concomitant medications, and other medical issues, and consult a physician.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage adjustments in clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations are not specifically mentioned for calcium orotate. Treatment follows general calcium and patient management principles in those settings.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are individualized based on factors such as renal function, other medical conditions, and concomitant medications. Consultation with a physician is crucial for determining the optimal dosage.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Common side effects may include gastrointestinal issues such as bloating, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, constipation, and diarrhea.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Rare side effects might include allergic reactions (skin rash, itching, difficulty breathing) and an increased risk of kidney stones.


### **Long-Term Effects**

The sources did not provide information on potential long-term effects from prolonged use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs requiring immediate attention include severe allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) and hypercalcemia.

## **Contraindications**

Calcium orotate is contraindicated in patients with hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels) or known hypersensitivity to any components of the formulation.

## **Drug Interactions**

Calcium orotate may interact with several medications, including:

* Bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate): Decreased bisphosphonate absorption.
* Tetracycline antibiotics (e.g., doxycycline): Decreased tetracycline absorption.
* Quinolone antibiotics (e.g., ciprofloxacin): Decreased quinolone absorption.
* Digoxin: Potential for altered digoxin effects.
* Cellulose sodium phosphate: Potential interaction.
* Certain phosphate binders (e.g., calcium acetate): Potential interaction.
* Levothyroxine: Decreased levothyroxine absorption.
* Estramustine: Potential interaction.
Concomitant use with thiazide diuretics may increase the risk of hypercalcemia. Alcohol, caffeine, and soft drinks may inhibit calcium absorption.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Calcium orotate is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, it is crucial to consult with a doctor to ensure appropriate dosage and avoid potential interactions.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Facilitates calcium transport into cells, enhancing absorption and utilization, especially in bone and cartilage.
* **Side Effects:** Bloating, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, constipation, diarrhea, allergic reactions, increased risk of kidney stones.
* **Contraindications:** Hypercalcemia, hypersensitivity to components.
* **Drug Interactions:** Bisphosphonates, tetracyclines, quinolones, digoxin, cellulose sodium phosphate, phosphate binders, levothyroxine, estramustine, thiazide diuretics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe, but consult a physician for appropriate dosage and potential interactions.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 1-2 tablets (740 mg calcium orotate) daily, preferably with food. Pediatric dosage hasn't been established.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Serum calcium and phosphorus levels, especially in patients with renal impairment.


## **Popular Combinations**

Calcium orotate is sometimes combined with vitamin D3 to further improve calcium absorption and bone health.

## **Precautions**

General precautions include screening for allergies, metabolic disorders, and organ dysfunction. Exercise caution in patients with kidney disease or history of kidney stones.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women, children, and the elderly should consult their doctor. Lifestyle considerations: Limit alcohol, caffeine, and soft drinks.
