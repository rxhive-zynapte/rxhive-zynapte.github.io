## **Usage**

Calcium Pantothenate, the calcium salt of Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), is primarily prescribed for the prevention and treatment of Pantothenic acid deficiency.  While rare, this deficiency can manifest as paresthesia, dysesthesia, and irritability. It is also used to support overall health and well-being, as Pantothenic acid is essential for various metabolic processes, including energy production, hormone synthesis, and the formation of red blood cells.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Vitamin, water-soluble, Vitamin B complex.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Pantothenic acid is a precursor to coenzyme A (CoA) and acyl carrier protein. CoA is vital for energy production from carbohydrates, fats, and proteins through the Krebs cycle and fatty acid oxidation. It also plays a crucial role in the synthesis of cholesterol, steroid hormones, and neurotransmitters.

## **Alternate Names**

- Pantothenic Acid
- Vitamin B5
- Calcium-pantothenate
- Dexpanthenol (a related chemical often used topically).

There are many brands manufacturing medications which contain Calcium Pantothenate.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Calcium Pantothenate acts as a precursor of CoA. CoA plays a role in energy metabolism, as well as cholesterol, steroid hormones, and neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - **Absorption:** Readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral ingestion.
    - **Metabolism:** Converted to CoA intracellularly.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted primarily in the urine unchanged. No major hepatic metabolism is involved. No known interactions with specific CYP enzymes.


- **Mode of Action:** Pantothenic acid is phosphorylated to 4′-phosphopantothenate, then combined with cysteine and ATP to form 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine. This condenses with ATP to produce dephospho-CoA, which is finally phosphorylated to CoA.


- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Does not directly bind to receptors. Acts as a substrate and precursor for CoA biosynthesis. Indirectly involved in neurotransmitter modulation through CoA's role in acetylcholine synthesis.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion, with minimal hepatic involvement.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

5 mg/day orally. Some practitioners recommend up to 500 mg daily for demanding lifestyles or treating specific conditions. This can be achieved through time-release tablets.

#### **Children:**  Dosing is dependent on age, from 1.7 mg/day for infants under 6 months up to 5 mg/day for teenagers. Consult pediatric guidelines for detailed dosing recommendations.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments, however, start with a lower dose and monitor for side effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment is unlikely as it is primarily excreted in the urine. However, consult a nephrologist.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor patients with diabetes for any changes in blood sugar levels. No specific adjustments for cardiovascular disease are indicated.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific medical settings are currently not well-defined. The primary clinical use is for pantothenic acid deficiency.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Not typically necessary but, use caution with patients with renal disease due to the calcium component. Always consider individual patient factors and consult specialized guidelines if needed.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Generally well-tolerated. High doses (above 10 g/day) may cause mild diarrhea.



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions such as skin rash, itching, swelling, dizziness, or difficulty breathing (though extremely rare).



### **Long-Term Effects**

No known long-term adverse effects.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Rare. Allergic reactions require urgent attention.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to pantothenic acid or components of the formulation.


## **Drug Interactions**

Generally well-tolerated, but some mild interactions exist. Consult a comprehensive drug interaction database for further information.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding at recommended daily allowances (RDA): 6 mg/day during pregnancy, and 7 mg/day during breastfeeding. Always consult a healthcare professional for guidance.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Precursor to CoA, essential for energy metabolism, hormone and neurotransmitter synthesis.
- **Side Effects:** Generally well-tolerated; high doses may cause diarrhea; rare allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:** Minimal interactions, generally well-tolerated.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Safe at RDA; consult physician for higher doses.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 5 mg/day. Pregnancy: 6 mg/day. Breastfeeding: 7 mg/day.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** None routinely required.


## **Popular Combinations**

Often included in B-complex vitamin formulations. Combining with other B vitamins can have synergistic effects in supporting overall metabolic function.


## **Precautions**

Pre-existing renal disease; monitor calcium levels and kidney function. Always consider allergy potential and individual patient factors.
