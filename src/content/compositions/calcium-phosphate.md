## **Usage**

- Calcium phosphate is primarily used to prevent and treat calcium deficiencies. It's also prescribed for conditions like hypocalcemia (low blood calcium) and osteoporosis (weak and brittle bones).
- **Pharmacological classification**: Mineral supplement, calcium replacement agent.
- **Mechanism of action**: Calcium phosphate provides a source of calcium and phosphate, essential minerals for bone formation, nerve function, muscle contraction, and other bodily processes. It works by supplementing dietary intake or correcting deficiencies to maintain optimal calcium and phosphate levels.

## **Alternate Names**

- Tricalcium phosphate, calcium phosphate tribasic.
- Brand names: Posture, PhosLo (calcium acetate).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Calcium is vital for various physiological functions including bone mineralization, muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, blood clotting, and enzyme regulation. Phosphate plays a role in bone health, energy metabolism, acid-base balance, and cell signaling.
- **Pharmacokinetics**:
    - *Absorption*: Calcium absorption from the gut is influenced by factors like vitamin D, dietary components, and the form of calcium supplement.  Smaller doses (500 mg or less) are absorbed more efficiently. Food also enhances absorption, although calcium citrate is absorbed well with or without food.
    - *Metabolism*: Calcium is not metabolized in the conventional sense. It is distributed throughout the body, with the majority stored in bones.  Phosphate homeostasis is regulated by the kidneys, intestines, and bones, influenced by hormones like parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D, and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23).
    - *Elimination*: Excess calcium and phosphate are excreted primarily by the kidneys.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Prevention of deficiency:  1000-1200 mg of elemental calcium per day (equivalent to 2500-3000 mg of calcium phosphate). Divide doses if exceeding 600 mg of calcium.
- Treatment of deficiency: Determined by the prescriber based on the severity of the deficiency.

#### **Children:**

- Dosage varies depending on age:
    - 1-3 years: 700 mg/day
    - 4-8 years: 1000 mg/day
    - 9-18 years: 1300 mg/day
- Pediatric safety considerations: Avoid exceeding the tolerable upper intake level (UL) to prevent adverse effects.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: 1200 mg/day for women over 50 and men over 70. Monitor calcium levels and adjust dosage as needed.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Careful monitoring and dosage adjustment are essential due to potential difficulties with calcium and phosphate excretion. Avoid calcium-based phosphate binders in patients with hypercalcemia or low PTH levels. Restrict total calcium intake to a maximum of 2000 mg/day, including dietary calcium.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Generally, no specific dosage adjustment is required. 
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Individualized assessment and dosage modification might be necessary.
