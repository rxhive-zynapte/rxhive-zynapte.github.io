## **Usage**

- Camostat is prescribed for the remission of acute symptoms in chronic pancreatitis and for the treatment of postoperative reflux esophagitis.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Serine protease inhibitor.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Camostat inhibits several serine proteases, including trypsin, kallikrein, and TMPRSS2. This action reduces the activity of pancreatic enzymes and diminishes pancreatic inflammation in chronic pancreatitis. It also inhibits TMPRSS2, which plays a role in viral cell entry, including SARS-CoV-2.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:** Camostat mesilate (mesylate refers to the salt form).
- **Brand Names:** Foipan, Foypan.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Camostat reduces pancreatic enzyme activity, thereby decreasing inflammation in the pancreas. It also blocks the entry of certain viruses into host cells.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Orally administered camostat is rapidly absorbed and metabolized to its active metabolite, 4-(4-guanidinobenzoyloxy)phenylacetate (GBPA).
    - **Metabolism:**  Camostat mesylate is hydrolyzed by carboxyesterase to GBPA. GBPA is further hydrolyzed by arylesterase to 4-guanidinobenzoic acid (GBA).
    - **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated via renal excretion (89.8-95.6%) with a small amount excreted in feces (1.0-1.7%). The half-life is approximately 3.8-4.7 hours, and clearance is 4.5-7.3 mL/min/kg.
- **Mode of Action:**  Camostat and GBPA competitively and reversibly bind to the active site of serine proteases. GBA binds covalently.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Inhibits serine proteases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, kallikrein, and TMPRSS2.
