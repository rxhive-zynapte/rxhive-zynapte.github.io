## **Usage**

- Camphor is prescribed for the topical relief of minor muscle aches, pain, and itching. It's also used in vapor rubs to relieve cough and congestion.  It acts as a counterirritant, creating a warming or cooling sensation that distracts from the original discomfort.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Topical analgesic, counterirritant, antitussive (when inhaled).

## **Alternate Names**
-  Cemphire, Cinnamomum camphora.
- **Brand Names:** Vicks VapoRub, BenGay, Tiger Balm (often in combination with other ingredients).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Camphor stimulates nerve endings in the skin that are sensitive to temperature and pain. This creates a sensation of warmth or coolness, masking the perception of pain and itching. When inhaled, it can act as a mild anesthetic and decongestant on the respiratory tract.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Camphor is readily absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine.
- **Mode of Action:**  Topically, camphor activates TRPM8 receptors, which are involved in cold sensation. It can also modulate other receptors and ion channels, leading to a complex interplay of sensory effects. When inhaled, it can mildly depress the central nervous system.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism followed by renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
Topical: Apply a thin layer of camphor-containing product (e.g., ointment, cream, or balm) to the affected area 3-4 times daily. For vapor rubs, follow product instructions.
