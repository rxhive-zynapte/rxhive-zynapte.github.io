## **Usage**

Camylofin is an antispasmodic drug primarily prescribed to relieve smooth muscle spasms in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. It's commonly used to treat conditions such as:

* **Intestinal colic:** Pain caused by spasms in the intestines.
* **Biliary colic:** Pain caused by gallstones blocking the bile duct.
* **Renal colic:** Pain caused by kidney stones.
* **Dysmenorrhea:** Painful menstrual cramps.

Its pharmacological classification is antispasmodic.

Camylofin's mechanism of action involves a dual effect: a direct papaverine-like effect on smooth muscle and a mild atropine-like anticholinergic effect. It relaxes smooth muscles by inhibiting phosphodiesterase IV, leading to increased intracellular cyclic AMP, and by reducing acetylcholine binding to muscarinic receptors.

## **Alternate Names**

The generic name is Camylofin dihydrochloride. Brand names may vary depending on the region and include Anafortan, Anaspas, Carespas, and others.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Camylofin exerts its effects by causing direct relaxation of smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal, biliary, renal, and uterine systems. This reduces spasms and the associated pain.  The drug's effect is a combination of two mechanisms: a direct papaverine-like myotropic action on the smooth muscle, and a weaker atropine-like anticholinergic action.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Information on the pharmacokinetics of Camylofin, such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, is limited in the provided sources.  It is known to be administered orally, intramuscularly, and intravenously. Further information is required for a complete understanding of the pharmacokinetic profile.

**Mode of Action:** At the cellular level, Camylofin's myotropic effect is caused by inhibiting the enzyme phosphodiesterase IV. This inhibition results in an increase of intracellular cyclic AMP, leading to a decrease in intracellular calcium levels and subsequent smooth muscle relaxation. The anticholinergic component of Camylofin's mechanism involves inhibiting the binding of acetylcholine to muscarinic receptors. This diminishes the cholinergic stimulation of smooth muscle contraction, further contributing to its antispasmodic effect.

**Elimination Pathways:** Detailed information regarding Camylofin's elimination pathways is not specified in the provided sources.  Further investigation is necessary to gain insights into its excretion and metabolism.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard adult dosage is 25mg, taken up to three times daily, either orally or by injection (IM or IV).

#### **Children:**

Dosage for children should be determined by a healthcare provider and is typically calculated based on body weight (0.285 to 0.857 mg/kg every 8 hours). One source indicates that the medicine may be appropriate starting in infancy. Another source advises it should not be used in children under 12. This conflict should be clarified with a specialist. 

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients**: Caution should be exercised in elderly patients due to potential increased sensitivity to anticholinergic effects, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions like urinary retention and constipation.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment**:  Dose adjustments might be needed based on kidney function; consultation with a healthcare professional is crucial.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**:  Caution is warranted in patients with liver disease; dose modifications may be required under medical supervision.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**:  Patients with glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, mechanical stenoses of the GI or urinary tract, tachyarrhythmias, ulcerative colitis, pyloric stenosis, and obstructive lung disease should use camylofin with caution or avoid it altogether. Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with cardiovascular disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not specified in the provided sources. Dosage will be determined by the healthcare professional based on patient condition.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments might be necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and other underlying health conditions. Consultation with a healthcare professional is important for determining appropriate dosing in such cases.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Dry mouth
* Constipation
* Nausea and vomiting
* Dizziness and drowsiness
* Blurred vision

* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Granulocytopenia
* Irregular Heart Rate

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term effects are not explicitly discussed in the given source texts.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs include hypersensitivity reactions and cardiac irregularities.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to Camylofin or its components.

* Urinary retention.


## **Drug Interactions**

Camylofin can interact with several medications, including:

* Anticholinergic agents (atropine, scopolamine)
* Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, clomipramine)
* Antipsychotics (olanzapine, clozapine)
* Opioid analgesics (morphine, fentanyl)
* Medications affecting heart rhythm (digoxin)
* Amantadine
* Warfarin
* Methotrexate
* Isoniazid and rifampicin
* Alcohol (should be avoided)

Consult a healthcare professional for a comprehensive evaluation of potential drug interactions based on individual patient medication profiles.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of Camylofin during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established. It should only be used if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks, under strict medical supervision.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Dual action: direct smooth muscle relaxation and anticholinergic effect.
* **Side Effects:** Dry mouth, constipation, nausea, dizziness, blurred vision, skin rash. Serious side effects are rare but can include allergic reactions and cardiac issues.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, GI/urinary obstructions, certain other conditions.
* **Drug Interactions:** Anticholinergics, tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotics, opioids, cardiac medications.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 25mg up to three times daily (oral or injection). Pediatric dosage should be determined by a doctor.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor vital signs, particularly heart rate and rhythm. Observe for signs of anticholinergic side effects (e.g., urinary retention, constipation).

## **Popular Combinations**

Camylofin is often combined with paracetamol (acetaminophen), diclofenac, nimesulide or mefenamic acid for enhanced analgesic effects in managing pain associated with abdominal cramps and dysmenorrhea.
