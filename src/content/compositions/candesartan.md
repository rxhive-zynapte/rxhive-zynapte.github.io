      What is the recommended dosage for Candesartan?**


      **A:**  The standard adult dose for hypertension is 8-32 mg once daily.
      For heart failure, it is 4-32 mg once daily. Pediatric dosing for
      hypertension is based on weight: <50 kg, 4-8 mg/day; ≥50 kg, 8-16 mg/day.
      Elderly patients and those with renal/hepatic impairment may require lower
      starting doses.

      How does Candesartan differ from an ACE inhibitor?**


      **A:** Both lower blood pressure by affecting the
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), but Candesartan acts by
      blocking angiotensin II receptors, while ACE inhibitors prevent the
      formation of angiotensin II.  Candesartan may be better tolerated by
      patients who develop a cough with ACE inhibitors.

      What is the mechanism of action of Candesartan in heart failure?**


      **A:** In heart failure, Candesartan blocks the deleterious effects of
      angiotensin II, which can contribute to cardiac remodeling and worsening
      heart function. By blocking angiotensin II at the AT1 receptor,
      candesartan reduces vasoconstriction, decreases aldosterone secretion, and
      improves cardiac output, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality.

      signs of angioedema or worsening renal function, and avoiding potassium
      supplements unless specifically prescribed. Advise female patients of
      childbearing age about the potential for fetal harm and the need to use
      reliable contraception.

## **Usage**

Candesartan is prescribed for:
- Hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults and children 6 to <18 years of age.
- Heart failure in adults with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), especially when Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are not tolerated or as add-on therapy to ACE inhibitors when symptoms persist and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) cannot be used.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB)

**Mechanism of Action:** Candesartan blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that causes blood vessels to constrict and raises blood pressure. By blocking angiotensin II receptors, candesartan causes vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), leading to lower blood pressure.  It also reduces the workload on the heart, making it easier to pump blood.

## **Alternate Names**

**Generic Name:** Candesartan cilexetil

**Brand Names:** Atacand, others

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Candesartan exerts its antihypertensive effect primarily by selectively blocking angiotensin II at the AT1 receptor subtype. This leads to decreased vasoconstriction and reduced aldosterone secretion, thus reducing blood pressure. In heart failure patients, this translates to improvement of cardiac performance and reduced morbidity and mortality.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
- **Absorption:** Well absorbed orally. The bioavailability of candesartan after oral administration is approximately 15%.
- **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver via O-deethylation to the pharmacologically active metabolite candesartan.
- **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated in the urine and feces (about two thirds and one third of the dose, respectively).


**Mode of Action:** Candesartan competitively binds to the AT1 receptor, preventing angiotensin II from binding and exerting its vasoconstricting effects. This inhibition at the receptor level leads to vasodilation and a decrease in blood pressure.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Renal and hepatic elimination; less than 5% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Hypertension:** Initial dose is 8 mg once daily, adjustable up to 32 mg/day as a single dose or in two divided doses.
* **Heart Failure:** Initial dose is 4 mg once daily, doubled at intervals of at least two weeks as needed, up to a maximum of 32 mg once daily.

#### **Children (6 to <18 years, Hypertension):**

* **<50 kg:** Initial dose: 4-8 mg/day; maximum: 8 mg/day.
* **≥50 kg:** Initial dose: 8-16 mg/day; maximum: 32 mg/day.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Start with a lower dose, particularly if volume depleted. Careful monitoring of renal function is recommended.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Initial dose of 4 mg daily; titrate according to response. Limited experience in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <15 mL/min).
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Initial dose 4 mg daily for mild to moderate impairment. Contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment. 
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dose adjustment may be needed.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Candesartan's primary uses are hypertension and heart failure. The dosage in these settings is addressed under "Standard Dosage" above.  Candesartan does not have direct applications for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.  Its use in these cases is limited to the management of comorbid conditions such as hypertension or heart failure.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary based on patient-specific factors such as renal/hepatic dysfunction, volume depletion, response to therapy, and concomitant medications.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
- Back pain
- Dizziness
- Upper respiratory tract infections (URTI)
- Cold- or flu-like symptoms

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
- Angioedema

- Renal impairment (worsening of kidney function)
- Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels)

### **Long-Term Effects:**
- Chronic renal impairment may occur with prolonged use, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney disease.
