## **Usage**

Capecitabine is an antineoplastic antimetabolite specifically classified as a fluoropyrimidine carbamate.  It is prescribed for the treatment of various cancers, including:

*   **Colon Cancer:** Adjuvant treatment of Dukes' C colon cancer after complete resection of the primary tumor.
*   **Colorectal Cancer:** First-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, often in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Also used in the peri-operative setting for rectal cancer, with or without radiation therapy.
*   **Breast Cancer:**  Treatment of metastatic breast cancer, particularly in patients who have received prior anthracycline or taxane therapy. It may be used as a single agent or in combination with docetaxel.
*   **Esophageal, Gastric (Stomach), or Gastroesophageal Junction Cancers:** In combination with other cancer treatments for cases where the cancer has spread or cannot be surgically removed.

Capecitabine's mechanism of action involves its conversion to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) within tumor tissues. 5-FU disrupts DNA and RNA synthesis, inhibiting cancer cell growth and division.

## **Alternate Names**

*   **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Capecitabine
*   **Brand Name:** Xeloda®

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Capecitabine itself is a prodrug, meaning it is inactive until metabolized. It undergoes a three-step enzymatic conversion, culminating in the formation of 5-FU preferentially within tumor tissues.  5-FU is an antimetabolite that inhibits thymidylate synthase, a key enzyme in DNA and RNA synthesis.  This inhibition leads to impaired cell division and ultimately apoptosis (cell death) in rapidly dividing cancer cells.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:**  Orally administered capecitabine is rapidly and extensively absorbed. Food may decrease the rate but not the extent of absorption.
*   **Metabolism:** Capecitabine undergoes a three-step enzymatic conversion: First, it is converted to 5'-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine (5'-DFCR) by carboxylesterase in the liver.  Then, 5'-DFCR is converted to 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5'-DFUR) by cytidine deaminase, primarily in the liver and tumor tissues. Finally, 5'-DFUR is converted to the active 5-FU by thymidine phosphorylase, which is present in higher concentrations in tumor tissue compared to healthy tissues. This targeted activation minimizes systemic exposure to 5-FU and reduces its associated side effects.
*   **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated via the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** The primary mode of action is through the inhibition of thymidylate synthase by its metabolite, 5-FU. This interferes with DNA and RNA synthesis, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Dosage is calculated based on body surface area (BSA) and typically administered within 30 minutes after a meal.

*   **Monotherapy (Metastatic Breast Cancer, Adjuvant Colon Cancer, Metastatic Colorectal Cancer):** 1250 mg/m² orally twice daily for 14 days followed by a 7-day rest period. This 21-day cycle is repeated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
*   **Adjuvant Colon Cancer:** Treatment is usually continued for a total of 6 months.
*   **Combination Therapy:** Starting doses are generally reduced when capecitabine is part of a combination regimen. The exact dose depends on the specific combination used and should be determined by the treating physician. Refer to the specific combination therapy guidelines (e.g., XELOX, CAPEDOCE) for detailed dosage information.
*   **Rectal Cancer (Peri-operative):** With concurrent radiation: 825 mg/m² orally twice daily. Without radiation: 1250 mg/m² orally twice daily.

#### **Children:**

There is no established standard dosage for children. Use in pediatric patients is generally avoided, except in specific clinical trials under strict supervision.



#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Close monitoring is recommended, as elderly patients, especially those over 80, are more susceptible to side effects. Dosage adjustments may be needed.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is necessary for patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.  Capecitabine is contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Careful monitoring is advised in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment due to liver metastases. No data are available for patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution should be exercised in patients with pre-existing heart conditions, as capecitabine can exacerbate cardiac issues.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Capecitabine's dosage in clinical use cases, including intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations, would be determined based on the underlying cancer being treated and the specific combination regimen used, if any. There are no specific dosage guidelines unique to these clinical settings.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are necessary based on patient-specific factors such as:

*   **Renal/Hepatic Dysfunction:**  As detailed above, dose reductions are often required.
*   **Myelosuppression:**  Capecitabine can cause a decrease in blood cell counts. Dosage adjustments or treatment interruptions may be necessary based on the severity of myelosuppression.
*   **Hand-Foot Syndrome:** Dose reductions are recommended for severe hand-foot syndrome.
*   **Other Toxicities:** Other significant adverse effects may necessitate dosage modifications or temporary cessation of treatment.
*   **Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase (DPD) Deficiency:** Patients with DPD deficiency are at increased risk of severe toxicity.  Genetic testing for DPD deficiency should be considered before starting treatment, especially in cases of unexplained toxicity. Dose adjustments or avoidance of capecitabine may be necessary.


## **Side Effects**

*   Diarrhea
*   Nausea and Vomiting
*   Fatigue
*   Hand-Foot Syndrome (Palmar-Plantar Erythrodysesthesia)

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic complications from prolonged use can include secondary cancers, cardiac dysfunction, and pulmonary fibrosis.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs requiring immediate intervention include severe allergic reactions, cardiotoxicity, severe myelosuppression, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, severe diarrhea/dehydration, hepatic and renal dysfunction, and DPD deficiency-related toxicity.

## **Drug Interactions**

Capecitabine has numerous drug interactions, including:

*   **Anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin):** Altered metabolism of both drugs.
*   **CYP450 substrates:**  Capecitabine is not extensively metabolized by CYP450 enzymes, but its metabolite 5-FU can interact with CYP2C9 substrates.
*   **Brivudine:**  Concomitant use is contraindicated due to the increased risk of severe toxicity.
*   **Leucovorin:**  Can enhance the effects of capecitabine, potentially increasing toxicity.
*   **Other Chemotherapy Drugs:**  Combination therapy with other myelosuppressive agents can increase the risk of bone marrow suppression.


Interactions with OTC drugs, supplements, food, and lifestyle factors (e.g., alcohol, smoking, grapefruit juice) are not as well-defined, but it's important to consider the potential for interactions.
