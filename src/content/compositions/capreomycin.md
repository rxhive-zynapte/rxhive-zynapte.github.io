## Usage

Capreomycin sulfate is an antimycobacterial agent indicated for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) caused by capreomycin-susceptible strains of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, when primary agents (isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, aminosalicylic acid, and streptomycin) have been ineffective or cannot be used due to toxicity or the presence of resistant tubercle bacilli.  It is classified as a cyclic polypeptide antibiotic.

Capreomycin inhibits protein synthesis in susceptible *M. tuberculosis* strains, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death. It works by binding to the bacterial ribosome, specifically to the 30S subunit, and interfering with the process of translation.

## Alternate Names

Capreomycin is also known as Capastat Sulfate (brand name).

## How It Works

**Pharmacodynamics:** Capreomycin exerts its bactericidal effect by inhibiting protein synthesis in susceptible mycobacteria. It binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit, interfering with the formation of the initiation complex and causing misreading of messenger RNA.  This ultimately disrupts protein synthesis and leads to bacterial cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Capreomycin is not absorbed orally and must be administered intramuscularly (IM) or intravenously (IV).
* **Distribution:** After IM or IV administration, capreomycin distributes widely into extracellular fluids but has limited penetration into cerebrospinal fluid.
* **Metabolism:** Capreomycin is not significantly metabolized.
* **Excretion:** Primarily eliminated unchanged by the kidneys through glomerular filtration. The elimination half-life is approximately 3-6 hours in patients with normal renal function.

**Elimination Pathways:** Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination.

## Dosage

### Standard Dosage

#### Adults:

* **Initial:** 1 g IM/IV daily (not to exceed 20 mg/kg/day) for 60-120 days.
* **Maintenance:** 1 g IM/IV 2-3 times/week. Total treatment duration for tuberculosis should be 12-24 months.

#### Children:

* `<15 years old and <40 kg:` 15-30 mg/kg IV/IM daily (maximum 1 g/day) for 2-4 months followed by 15-30 mg/kg twice weekly (maximum 1 g/day).
* `>15 years old and >40 kg:` 15 mg/kg IV/IM daily (maximum 1 g/day) for 2-4 months followed by 15 mg/kg 2-3 times/week (maximum 1 g/dose).
* Capreomycin is always used in conjunction with other antitubercular agents in children.

#### Special Cases:

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage reduction may be necessary based on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustment is necessary based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific dose adjustments are typically needed as capreomycin is primarily renally eliminated. However, close monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution advised in patients with pre-existing hearing impairment.


### Clinical Use Cases

Capreomycin is specifically indicated for drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis. Its use in other clinical settings (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations) is not established or recommended.

### Dosage Adjustments

Dose modifications are required for patients with renal impairment.


## Side Effects

### Common Side Effects:

* Nephrotoxicity (e.g., elevated BUN, creatinine)
* Ototoxicity (hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo)
* Electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia)
* Pain and induration at injection site


### Rare but Serious Side Effects:

* Renal failure
* Permanent hearing loss
* Severe allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)


### Long-Term Effects:

* Chronic kidney disease
* Permanent hearing impairment


### Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):

* Renal failure
* Severe allergic reactions



## Contraindications

* Hypersensitivity to capreomycin
* Pre-existing auditory or vestibular dysfunction



## Drug Interactions

Numerous drug interactions are possible with capreomycin, particularly with other nephrotoxic or ototoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides (amikacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, tobramycin), polymyxins (colistin, polymyxin B), and vancomycin. Neuromuscular blocking agents like atracurium, cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium, and vecuronium can have additive effects with capreomycin, increasing the risk of respiratory depression.


## Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C
* Fetal risks include teratogenicity, particularly in the first trimester.
* Excretion in breast milk: Unknown. Caution advised when administered to nursing mothers.



## Drug Profile Summary

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits protein synthesis in susceptible mycobacteria by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit.
* **Side Effects:** Nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, electrolyte disturbances, injection site reactions, allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to capreomycin, pre-existing auditory or vestibular dysfunction.
* **Drug Interactions:** Aminoglycosides, polymyxins, vancomycin, neuromuscular blocking agents.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category C; caution advised.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 1 g IM/IV daily for 60-120 days followed by 1 g IM/IV 2-3 times/week; Pediatric dosing based on weight, maximum 1g/day. Adjustments needed for renal impairment.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function (BUN, creatinine), serum electrolytes (potassium, magnesium, calcium), audiometry.

## Popular Combinations

Capreomycin is typically used in combination with other second-line anti-TB drugs, tailored to the individual patient's resistance profile. These may include ethionamide, cycloserine, para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS), fluoroquinolones, and bedaquiline or linezolid in some cases.


## Precautions

* Renal function, hearing, and electrolyte monitoring are crucial.
* Pre-existing renal or auditory impairment requires careful consideration and dose adjustments.
* Use with caution in pregnant or breastfeeding women.
* Safety and efficacy in children have not been fully established.
