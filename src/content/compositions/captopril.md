## **Usage**

Captopril is prescribed for:
- Hypertension (high blood pressure)
- Heart failure
- Diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease caused by diabetes)
- Left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction (heart attack)

**Pharmacological Classification:** Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.

**Mechanism of Action:** Captopril blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor.  This leads to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), reduced blood pressure, and decreased workload on the heart.  It also reduces aldosterone secretion, which leads to decreased sodium and water retention.

## **Alternate Names**

Captopril is the generic name.  Brand names include Capoten.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Captopril's primary effect is to lower blood pressure and reduce cardiac afterload (the resistance the heart must overcome to pump blood).  It achieves this by preventing the formation of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, leading to vasodilation and a decrease in blood pressure.  It also reduces aldosterone secretion, leading to a decrease in sodium and water retention.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
- **Absorption:** Absorbed rapidly from the gastrointestinal tract, absorption reduced by food.
- **Metabolism:** Minimal hepatic metabolism.
- **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion, with a half-life of about 2 hours.


**Mode of Action:** Captopril competitively inhibits ACE, preventing the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.


**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Inhibits ACE enzyme activity.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion as captopril and captopril disulfide metabolite.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Hypertension:** Initial dose 25 mg orally two to three times a day.  Titrate upwards at 1-2 week intervals as needed to a maximum of 450 mg/day.
- **Heart Failure:** Initial dose 6.25-12.5 mg orally two or three times a day.  Titrate up to a target maintenance dose of 50 mg three times a day or higher as tolerated, to a maximum of 450 mg/day.
- **Post-Myocardial Infarction:** Initial dose 6.25 mg orally once as early as three days post-MI, followed by 12.5 mg three times daily. Increase to 25 mg three times daily, and then to a target dose of 50 mg three times daily over several weeks as tolerated, to a maximum of 450 mg/day.
- **Diabetic Nephropathy:** 25 mg orally three times a day, titrated as needed.


#### **Children:**

- Neonates: 0.05-0.1 mg/kg/dose every 8-24 hours, titrate up to 0.5 mg/kg/dose every 6-24 hours.
- Infants: 0.15-0.3 mg/kg/dose, titrate upward to a maximum of 6 mg/kg/day in divided doses.
- Children: 0.3-0.5 mg/kg/dose, titrate to a maximum of 6 mg/kg/day in divided doses every 6-12 hours.
- Adolescents: 12.5-25 mg/dose every 8-12 hours, may increase by 25 mg/dose every 1-2 weeks to a maximum of 450 mg/day.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate therapy with a lower starting dose (e.g., 6.25 mg twice daily) and titrate cautiously due to potential for reduced renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce dosage based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary depending on the specific comorbidity.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Captopril is not typically indicated for use in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or intensive care unit (ICU) use for the primary purpose of those conditions. It might be continued or adjusted during those situations for existing conditions like heart failure or hypertension.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be required in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, or in patients with certain comorbidities. Titrate cautiously in these populations and monitor closely.
