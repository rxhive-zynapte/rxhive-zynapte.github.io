## **Usage**

Carbazochrome is a hemostatic agent primarily used to control capillary bleeding. It is prescribed for various conditions characterized by capillary fragility or increased permeability, such as:

* Epistaxis (nosebleeds)
* Retinal hemorrhage
* Hemoptysis (coughing up blood)
* Gastrointestinal hemorrhage
* Hematuria (blood in urine)
* Uterine bleeding
* Hemorrhoids
* Post-surgical bleeding
* Bleeding from wounds
* Thrombocytopenic purpura (although its effectiveness in this condition is debated)

Its pharmacological classification is hemostatic agent.

Carbazochrome's mechanism of action involves interacting with α-adrenoreceptors on the surface of platelets.  This interaction promotes platelet aggregation (clumping) and adhesion, which helps form a platelet plug at the site of bleeding, effectively stopping blood loss.  It also exhibits some capillary-stabilizing properties, which further contribute to its hemostatic effects.


## **Alternate Names**

* Adrenochrome monosemicarbazone
* Adrenostazin

Brand names vary depending on the region. Examples include:

* Apricol Forte
* CKP
* Styptochrome
* Stadren
* Stopcrome



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Carbazochrome primarily affects platelet function by interacting with α-adrenoreceptors on platelets. This leads to increased platelet aggregation and adhesion, forming a platelet plug at the bleeding site.  It also exerts some vasoconstricting effects on capillaries.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Information on the pharmacokinetics of carbazochrome is limited.  Absorption, metabolism, and elimination pathways have not been fully elucidated.  Available data suggests it's administered orally, intramuscularly (IM), subcutaneously (SC), or intravenously (IV). Elimination pathways are not definitively established but likely involve hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.

**Mode of Action:** Carbazochrome binds to α-adrenoreceptors on platelets, triggering a cascade of intracellular events, including activation of phospholipase C (PLC), leading to increased inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) production.  This ultimately results in elevated intracellular calcium levels, promoting actin polymerization and myosin light chain kinase activation. These changes facilitate platelet shape change, aggregation, and adhesion.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Carbazochrome primarily acts via α-adrenoreceptor binding on platelets. It does not exhibit significant enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation.


## **Dosage**

The dosage of carbazochrome varies depending on the patient's age, condition, and the route of administration.  It's crucial to follow the prescribing physician's instructions.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral:** 10-30 mg three times daily.
* **IM/SC:** 10 mg daily.
* **IV:** 25-100 mg daily by injection or infusion.

#### **Children:**

Dosage in children should be determined by a physician, considering the child's weight and age. Generally, a lower dose than the adult dose is recommended.  Safety and efficacy in children have not been extensively studied.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary due to potential age-related decline in renal and hepatic function. Start with a lower dose and monitor closely.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution is advised. Dose adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Limited information is available. Use cautiously and monitor closely.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient factors and adjust the dose accordingly.

### **Clinical Use Cases:**

Specific dosage guidelines for these clinical scenarios are not well established, and clinical experience guides practice.  Consult with experienced colleagues or specialists for dosage recommendations.

* **Intubation:** Not typically indicated.
* **Surgical Procedures:** Pre-operative administration of 2-6 ml IM injection (1.5 mg/2ml concentration); post-operative administration of 1-2 ml IM injection every 2 hours.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not typically indicated.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  Dosage is based on the patient's condition and bleeding risk.
* **Emergency Situations:** Dosage varies based on the specific situation.


### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dose adjustments are made based on patient-specific factors, such as renal/hepatic impairment, other medical conditions, and response to therapy. Close monitoring is important, especially in patients with comorbidities.
