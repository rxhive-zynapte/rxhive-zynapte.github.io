## **Usage**

Carbenicillin, a semisynthetic penicillin, is classified as an extended-spectrum penicillin antibiotic. It is primarily prescribed for treating infections caused by gram-negative bacteria, particularly *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Proteus*, and *Enterobacter* species. Its use is mainly focused on urinary tract infections (UTIs), including cystitis and prostatitis. It's important to note that the oral form of carbenicillin (carbenicillin indanyl sodium) is no longer readily available in many countries like the United States. Primarily, it's now available as carbenicillin disodium for intravenous or intramuscular administration.  Carbenicillin's bactericidal effect is due to its inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis.  It binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), enzymes involved in the final steps of peptidoglycan synthesis. This binding disrupts cell wall integrity, leading to bacterial cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

Carbenicillin is also known as carbenicillin disodium (for injection) and carbenicillin indanyl sodium (for oral administration, although less common now). A common brand name for the oral form was Geocillin. However, brand names may vary regionally, and it is essential to verify the active ingredient to confirm it's carbenicillin.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Carbenicillin disrupts bacterial cell wall synthesis, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death. It achieves high concentrations in the urine, making it particularly effective against UTIs.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:** The oral form (carbenicillin indanyl sodium) is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and hydrolyzed to carbenicillin. The extent of absorption can be affected by food; therefore it's usually taken on an empty stomach. Intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) administration bypasses absorption, directly entering the bloodstream.
* **Metabolism:**  Minimal metabolism occurs.
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. This accounts for its efficacy in UTIs. Dosage adjustments are required in patients with renal impairment. Small amount is excreted in breast milk.

**Mode of Action:** Carbenicillin binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in the bacterial cell wall.  These proteins are crucial enzymes for the transpeptidation and carboxypeptidation reactions in the final stages of peptidoglycan synthesis.  By inhibiting PBPs, carbenicillin prevents cross-linking of peptidoglycan chains, weakening the cell wall and causing bacterial lysis.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The intravenous/intramuscular dosage varies considerably depending on the severity and site of the infection. For systemic infections, typical doses range from 200 to 300 mg/kg per day given by IV infusion, divided into four to six doses. Doses up to 400 mg/kg/day may be necessary for severe infections. The oral dosage form is significantly less commonly used and primarily limited to UTIs where it is 1-2 tablets (382 -764 mg) taken four times daily.

#### **Children:**

For children, a typical dose is 50 to 400 mg/kg/day given IV/IM divided into 4-6 doses.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary due to age-related decline in renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are crucial based on creatinine clearance. For CrCl 10 to 50 mL/min, 382 to 764 mg orally every 12 to 24 hours is recommended. Its use is not recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance less than 10 mL/min.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Care should be taken in patients with a history of seizures, bleeding disorders, or electrolyte imbalances.

### **Clinical Use Cases:**

The clinical use cases described below primarily apply to the injectable formulation (carbenicillin disodium).

* **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:** Carbenicillin may be used for prophylaxis or treatment of infections in these settings, with dosage adjusted based on patient-specific factors.
* **Emergency Situations:** Higher doses are often necessary for serious infections such as septicemia, depending on susceptibility testing results.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage should be modified in patients with renal impairment as noted above.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, unpleasant taste, flatulence, glossitis, abdominal cramps, dry mouth.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing, angioedema, anaphylaxis), seizures, abnormal bleeding or bruising, pain or difficulty urinating, signs of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) such as severe diarrhea, bloody stools, or stomach cramps.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia), anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, eosinophilia, interstitial nephritis are potential long-term effects with high doses.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Anaphylaxis, severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome), interstitial nephritis, seizures.

## **Contraindications**

Known hypersensitivity to penicillins or other beta-lactam antibiotics.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Probenecid:** Increases carbenicillin blood levels.
* **Methotrexate:** Carbenicillin may reduce the excretion of methotrexate, potentially increasing its toxicity.
* **Oral contraceptives:**  May decrease the efficacy of oral contraceptives.
* **Aminoglycosides:**  Synergistic effects when used in combination for certain infections, but should not be mixed directly in IV solutions due to inactivation.
* **Anticoagulants:**  May enhance the effects of anticoagulants, increasing the risk of bleeding.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** FDA Pregnancy Category B.  Caution should be exercised, and carbenicillin should only be used if clearly needed.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Excreted in breast milk in small amounts. While generally considered safe, monitor the infant for diarrhea or thrush.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to PBPs.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, allergic reactions, seizures, bleeding disorders.
* **Contraindications:** Penicillin or beta-lactam hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:** Probenecid, methotrexate, oral contraceptives, aminoglycosides, anticoagulants.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Category B; caution advised.  Excreted in breast milk.
* **Dosage:** Varies with infection severity and route of administration. See above sections.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Renal function, liver function (long-term), electrolytes, complete blood count (long-term).

## **Popular Combinations**

Carbenicillin is sometimes combined with aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin) for synergistic effects against *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and other gram-negative bacteria. However, they should not be mixed directly in the same IV solution due to inactivation.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess renal function, monitor for hypersensitivity reactions.
* **Specific Populations:** Pregnant women (use only if necessary), breastfeeding mothers (monitor infant).
* **Children & Elderly:** Dosage adjustments.
