## **Usage**

Carbidopa is prescribed in combination with levodopa for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and related conditions like postencephalitic parkinsonism and symptomatic parkinsonism which may be caused by carbon monoxide or manganese intoxication.  Carbidopa itself doesn't treat Parkinson's; it enhances levodopa's effectiveness.

It is classified as a decarboxylase inhibitor.

Carbidopa works by blocking the enzyme dopa decarboxylase, which breaks down levodopa in the peripheral tissues before it can reach the brain.  This allows more levodopa to cross the blood-brain barrier and be converted to dopamine, the neurotransmitter deficient in Parkinson's disease.

## **Alternate Names**

Carbidopa is primarily known by its generic name.  It is rarely used alone and is most frequently combined with levodopa in various formulations.  Some common brand names containing carbidopa-levodopa combinations include: Sinemet, Parcopa, Sinemet CR, Rytary, Duopa, Crexont, and Dhivy. Lodosyn is available as carbidopa monotherapy.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Carbidopa doesn't have inherent activity on the central nervous system. Its action lies in increasing levodopa availability in the brain.  This leads to increased dopamine levels, alleviating Parkinsonian symptoms like bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Carbidopa is readily absorbed after oral administration.
* **Metabolism:** Minimal metabolism of carbidopa itself occurs.
* **Elimination:**  Carbidopa is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Some excretion occurs via the biliary route (liver). Carbidopa doesn't involve CYP450 enzymes during its clearance.

**Mode of Action:** Carbidopa competitively inhibits the enzyme dopa decarboxylase in peripheral tissues. It doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore doesn't interfere with levodopa's conversion to dopamine in the brain.


## **Dosage**

Carbidopa is almost always administered with levodopa. Dosage is expressed in terms of both carbidopa and levodopa components.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Carbidopa dosage depends heavily on the patient's condition, levodopa requirements, and the specific carbidopa-levodopa formulation used.

* **Immediate-release tablets:** Initial dosages can range from 25 mg carbidopa/100 mg levodopa three times a day to higher dosages (up to 200 mg carbidopa, divided into multiple doses), depending on individual needs.

* **Controlled-release or extended-release formulations:** Dosages vary based on the specific product. Consult the prescribing information for precise starting and maintenance doses.

#### **Children:**

The use and dosage in children must be determined by a doctor. Pediatric dosing has to consider age, weight, and disease severity.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and titrate cautiously due to age-related changes in drug metabolism and clearance.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Careful monitoring is necessary, with cautious dose adjustments.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Similar to renal impairment, dosage modification may be necessary.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual case management and adjust the dosage based on comorbid diseases and other medications.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Carbidopa isn't directly used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or emergency situations.  Its role remains supportive to levodopa therapy, even in the ICU.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on individual patient response and tolerability. Consider factors like renal/hepatic function, other medical conditions, and concurrent medications.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, lightheadedness, and dyskinesias (involuntary movements) are commonly reported.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Low blood pressure upon standing (orthostatic hypotension), irregular heartbeats, and psychotic episodes are rare but potentially serious.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term use can exacerbate dyskinesias and motor fluctuations (wearing-off phenomenon).


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, hallucinations, and severe low blood pressure can occur and necessitate immediate medical intervention.



## **Contraindications**

Carbidopa is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to it or levodopa, narrow-angle glaucoma, and those taking non-selective MAO inhibitors.

## **Drug Interactions**

Carbidopa can interact with several medications, including:

* **Non-selective MAO inhibitors:** Can lead to hypertensive crises (a dangerous elevation of blood pressure).

* **Antihypertensives:** May potentiate their effects.

* **Antipsychotics:** Can interfere with levodopa’s therapeutic action.

* **Iron salts:** May decrease carbidopa-levodopa absorption.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Carbidopa's safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been fully established. It should be used only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus or infant.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Dopa decarboxylase inhibitor in peripheral tissues, increasing levodopa availability in the brain.

* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, dyskinesias, orthostatic hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias.

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, narrow-angle glaucoma, non-selective MAO inhibitors.

* **Drug Interactions:** MAO inhibitors, antihypertensives, antipsychotics.

* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use cautiously if potential benefit outweighs risk.


## **Popular Combinations**

Carbidopa is most popularly combined with levodopa (Sinemet, Rytary, Duopa).  Entacapone or opicapone may be added for extended therapeutic effect (Stalevo).


## **Precautions**

Monitor patients carefully for blood pressure changes, cardiac function, and psychiatric effects. Exercise extra caution in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, or endocrine disease.
