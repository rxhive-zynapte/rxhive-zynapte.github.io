## **Usage**

Carbocisteine is prescribed as adjunctive therapy for respiratory tract disorders characterized by excessive and viscous mucus secretions. This includes conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and other conditions where mucus clearance is impaired.  It is classified as a mucolytic agent.  Carbocisteine works by reducing the viscosity of mucus, making it easier to expectorate.  The exact mechanism is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve altering the structure of glycoproteins in the mucus.

## **Alternate Names**

Carbocisteine is also known as carbocysteine. Brand names include Mucodin, Solmux, Transbronchin, Tusilexil, Tussantiol, and Viscoteina.  Availability may vary by region.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Carbocisteine reduces the elasticity and viscosity of mucus by breaking disulfide bonds in mucoproteins. This facilitates easier expectoration and improves mucus clearance from the airways. It may also reduce goblet cell hyperplasia, thus decreasing mucus production.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:** Carbocisteine is rapidly and well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but its bioavailability is low (<10%) due to significant first-pass metabolism.
* **Distribution:** It distributes into lung tissue and respiratory mucus. The volume of distribution is approximately 60-105 L.
* **Metabolism:** Carbocisteine undergoes hepatic metabolism via acetylation, decarboxylation, and sulfoxidation.
* **Elimination:**  It is primarily excreted in the urine, both as unchanged drug and metabolites. The elimination half-life is approximately 1.4-2.5 hours.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Initial dose: 2250 mg daily in divided doses (e.g., 750 mg three times a day).
Maintenance dose: 1500 mg daily in divided doses (e.g., 500 mg three times a day or 375 mg four times a day) after a satisfactory response is obtained. Administer with food.

#### **Children:**

* 2-5 years: 20 mg/kg body weight daily, given in divided doses adjusted to the age range in different delivery forms
* 5-12 years: Recommended dosage in syrup or liquid form, adjusted to the age range, in divided doses, three times a day.
* Over 12: Same as adult dosage, based on weight and disease condition. Adjust as needed according to clinical response and tolerance.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Similar to adult dosing. Consider adjusting dose based on renal function and overall health status.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be necessary. Consult specific guidelines based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose modification may be required.  Monitor liver function tests.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with a history of peptic ulcers, gastritis or those on medications that can cause gastrointestinal bleeding.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

While Carbocisteine is beneficial in several clinical settings involving respiratory issues, standard dosages are used in managing increased and viscous mucus secretions.  These include intubation, surgery procedures, and mechanical ventilation.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

For patients with renal or hepatic impairment, adjust the dosage based on individual patient characteristics, renal function, and liver function tests.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, epigastric discomfort, headache, skin rash.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Gastrointestinal bleeding, anaphylactic reactions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, bullous dermatitis.

### **Long-Term Effects:**
Potential for chronic complications with prolonged use is limited, but monitor for gastrointestinal side effects.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
Any hypersensitivity reactions, severe gastrointestinal bleeding, and severe skin reactions should be considered as ADRs requiring immediate medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

Active peptic or duodenal ulcer, hypersensitivity to carbocisteine, patients with a history of gastroduodenal ulcers, chronic bronchial asthma, respiratory failure.

## **Drug Interactions**

Avoid concomitant use with antitussives (cough suppressants) and medications that dry up bronchial secretions as this can counteract the mucolytic effect of carbocisteine. Concomitant use with medications known to cause gastrointestinal bleeding should be done with caution.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Carbocisteine is generally not recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to limited safety data. Consult a physician for potential risks and benefits.  Safer alternatives may be considered.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Reduces mucus viscosity by altering glycoprotein structure, improving expectoration.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, epigastric discomfort, rare but serious gastrointestinal bleeding and skin reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Active peptic ulcer, hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:** Antitussives, drugs causing GI bleeding.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Not recommended.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 2250 mg/day initially, reduced to 1500 mg/day. Children: Dosage depends on age and weight.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Respiratory function, mucus viscosity, gastrointestinal symptoms, skin reactions.

## **Popular Combinations**

Carbocisteine is sometimes combined with bronchodilators (salbutamol) or antibiotics for synergistic effects in treating respiratory infections.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess for history of peptic ulcers, allergies.  Monitor renal and liver function if necessary.
* **Specific Populations:** Avoid in pregnancy/breastfeeding unless benefits outweigh risks. Exercise caution in the elderly and children.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Advise patients on potential interactions with alcohol (especially in liquid preparations containing ethanol).
