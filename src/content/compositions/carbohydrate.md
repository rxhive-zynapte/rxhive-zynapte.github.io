## **Usage**

Carbohydrates are not a medication or drug; they are one of the three macronutrients, along with protein and fats, essential for human life.  They are the body's primary source of energy. Carbohydrates are not prescribed but are a necessary component of any healthy diet.  Therefore, they do not have a pharmacological classification. The mechanism of action is providing glucose for energy after ingestion and digestion.  Instead of being prescribed for medical conditions, adequate carbohydrate intake is vital for preventing and managing conditions like hypoglycemia and maintaining overall health.


## **Alternate Names**

Carbohydrates are also known as saccharides, carbs, or sugars (in the case of simple carbohydrates). There are no brand names as carbohydrates are found naturally in foods and are not pharmaceutical products.  Different types of carbohydrates, such as glucose, fructose, sucrose, starch, and fiber, may be used in medical settings, like intravenous glucose solutions, but these are classified according to their specific chemical nature rather than as a "drug" called carbohydrate.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Carbohydrates, when consumed, are broken down into simple sugars, primarily glucose, through digestion. Glucose is absorbed into the bloodstream, causing blood glucose levels to rise.  This rise triggers the release of insulin from the pancreas, facilitating the uptake of glucose by cells throughout the body for energy production. Excess glucose is stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles or converted to fat for long-term energy storage.  

**Pharmacokinetics:** 
* **Absorption:** Simple sugars are rapidly absorbed in the small intestine. Complex carbohydrates require more extensive breakdown before absorption.
* **Metabolism:** Glucose is metabolized through glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain, producing ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the cellular energy currency.
* **Elimination:**  Carbohydrates are not eliminated intact. They are metabolized into carbon dioxide and water, with carbon dioxide being expelled through respiration and water through urine and other bodily fluids. Small amounts of undigested carbohydrates may be fermented by gut bacteria, producing gases.

Carbohydrates do not have a mode of action involving receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation in the way medications do. Their function is primarily metabolic, providing energy.  Elimination is not through specific renal or hepatic pathways as for drugs but primarily as metabolic byproducts.

## **Dosage**

Carbohydrates are not a drug, so there is no standard "dosage" in the pharmaceutical sense.  Dietary guidelines provide recommended intake ranges.

### **Standard Dosage**  
#### **Adults:**  
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that carbohydrates make up 45% to 65% of total daily calorie intake.  For a 2,000 calorie diet, this translates to approximately 225-325 grams of carbohydrates daily.

#### **Children:**  
Carbohydrate recommendations for children vary with age and individual needs.  Pediatric dietary guidelines should be consulted for specific recommendations.

#### **Special Cases:**

Considerations for elderly patients, those with renal or hepatic impairment, or comorbid conditions are made in the context of overall calorie and dietary management, not as specific carbohydrate "dose" adjustments.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  

In clinical settings, carbohydrates, often in the form of dextrose (glucose), are used intravenously for managing hypoglycemia or as part of parenteral nutrition solutions. Specific doses and infusion rates are determined by the patient's clinical status and needs. The administration of carbohydrates is considered a supportive measure rather than a drug treatment.  Dosage is determined based on the clinical context.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

"Dosage adjustments" for carbohydrates are not made in the same way as drug dosages.  Dietary carbohydrate intake is adjusted based on individual needs, metabolic status, and treatment goals for conditions like diabetes, but this is a dietary modification, not a medication adjustment.

## **Side Effects**

Excessive consumption of refined carbohydrates and added sugars can contribute to weight gain, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Insufficient carbohydrate intake can lead to hypoglycemia, particularly in individuals with diabetes or other metabolic conditions.

### **Common Side Effects (of excessive intake):**

* Weight gain
* Increased triglycerides
* Elevated blood sugar
* Insulin resistance


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects (generally related to underlying conditions):**
* Diabetic ketoacidosis (in type 1 diabetes with extremely low carbohydrate intake)
* Severe hypoglycemia (in patients with diabetes or other metabolic conditions)

### **Long-Term Effects (of excessive intake):**

* Type 2 diabetes
* Cardiovascular disease
* Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
* Certain cancers

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Carbohydrates do not have ADRs in the same way drugs do. Adverse effects are related to excessive or insufficient intake and its metabolic consequences.

## **Contraindications**

There are no absolute contraindications to consuming carbohydrates, as they are essential for survival. However, individuals with specific metabolic conditions, such as galactosemia or hereditary fructose intolerance, must avoid certain types of carbohydrates.  In some very rare genetic conditions, carbohydrate metabolism is impaired, requiring strict dietary management.

## **Drug Interactions**

Carbohydrates, as nutrients, can influence the pharmacokinetics of some medications. For example, high-fiber diets can affect the absorption of certain drugs. Conversely, some drugs can affect carbohydrate metabolism, such as corticosteroids which can induce hyperglycemia.  Alcohol can impair gluconeogenesis and increase the risk of hypoglycemia, especially in individuals taking insulin or other diabetes medications.  A detailed understanding of specific drug-nutrient interactions is essential for patient care. 

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Carbohydrates are crucial during pregnancy and breastfeeding for both maternal and fetal/infant health.  Adequate intake is necessary to support fetal growth and development and milk production.  Dietary guidelines for pregnancy and lactation provide recommended carbohydrate intakes. There is no specific "pregnancy safety category" for carbohydrates as they are not a drug.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

It is inaccurate to provide a drug profile summary for carbohydrates as they are a nutrient, not a medication.


## **Popular Combinations**

This section is not applicable to carbohydrates.

## **Precautions**

Precautions regarding carbohydrates relate to the type and quantity of carbohydrates consumed.  Focus should be on whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes while limiting refined grains, added sugars, and highly processed foods.  Dietary counseling is essential for managing conditions like diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease.
