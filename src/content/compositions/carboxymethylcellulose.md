## **Usage**

Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) is prescribed for the treatment of dry eye syndrome (DES) and other related ocular conditions. It belongs to the pharmacological classification of ophthalmic lubricants, also known as artificial tears.  CMC works by mimicking natural tears to lubricate the ocular surface, providing temporary relief from burning, irritation, and discomfort associated with dry eyes.

## **Alternate Names**

Carboxymethylcellulose is also known as CMC. Brand names include Refresh Liquigel, Refresh Celluvisc, GenTeal, TheraTears, and many others.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** CMC is a viscosity-enhancing agent that increases the thickness of the tear film, prolonging its contact time with the ocular surface. This leads to improved lubrication and hydration of the eye. CMC is pharmacologically inert, acting locally and exhibiting minimal systemic absorption.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Due to its topical application and limited systemic absorption, detailed pharmacokinetic parameters (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) are not typically assessed for CMC ophthalmic solutions.  The effects are primarily local and transient.  

**Mode of Action:** CMC does not bind to specific receptors or inhibit enzymes. Its primary mode of action is physical, improving the tear film's stability and its adherence to the cornea.

**Elimination Pathways:** Any small amount of CMC absorbed systemically is likely excreted through renal or hepatic pathways.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Instill 1-2 drops in the affected eye(s) as needed, typically 4-8 times per day or as directed by a physician.

#### **Children:** For children 6 years and older, the dosage is usually the same as for adults. Use in children under 6 should be under the guidance of a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically needed.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustments are needed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustments are needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consult a doctor for guidance based on individual conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation:** May be used to lubricate the eyes during procedures.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Can protect the cornea during certain ophthalmic procedures.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Helps prevent corneal drying.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Similar to mechanical ventilation, aids in maintaining ocular moisture.
- **Emergency Situations:** May be used in cases of chemical exposure or corneal abrasion.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific dose modifications based on renal/hepatic dysfunction or metabolic disorders are required due to minimal systemic absorption.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Blurred vision (transient)
- Eye irritation (burning, stinging)
- Increased tearing

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
- Severe eye pain
- Changes in vision


### **Long-Term Effects**

No specific long-term side effects have been reported with CMC use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Serious ADRs are rare but require prompt medical attention if they occur.

## **Contraindications**

- Known hypersensitivity to carboxymethylcellulose or any of the inactive ingredients in the formulation.

## **Drug Interactions**

- If using multiple eye drops, separate applications by at least 5-15 minutes. Use CMC last if it is the most viscous solution.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

CMC is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to minimal systemic absorption. However, always consult with a physician before using any medication during pregnancy or while breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Ophthalmic lubricant; enhances tear film viscosity and prolongs contact time with the cornea.
- **Side Effects:** Transient blurred vision, eye irritation, increased tearing. Rarely, allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to CMC.
- **Drug Interactions:** Separate application of multiple eye drops by 5-15 minutes.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally considered safe; consult a physician before use.
- **Dosage:** 1-2 drops in affected eye(s) as needed, typically 4-8 times/day.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Observe for signs of eye irritation, allergic reactions, or changes in vision.

## **Popular Combinations**

Often combined with other lubricants or demulcents in artificial tear formulations.

## **Precautions**

- Avoid touching the tip of the bottle to any surface.
- Discard single-use containers after use.
- Consult a physician if symptoms persist or worsen after 72 hours.
