      What is the recommended dosage for Carmustine?**


      **A:**  For adults, 150-200 mg/m² IV every 6 weeks as a single agent. 
      Dosages are adjusted based on previous hematological response and for
      combination therapy. Pediatric use is contraindicated due to high risk of
      pulmonary toxicity.

## **Usage**

Carmustine is used as palliative therapy for:

* Brain tumors (glioblastoma, brainstem glioma, medulloblastoma, astrocytoma, ependymoma, and metastatic brain tumors)
* Multiple myeloma (in combination with prednisone)
* Hodgkin's disease (as secondary therapy)
* Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (as secondary therapy)

It is also used off-label for mycosis fungoides.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Alkylating agent; Nitrosourea.

**Mechanism of Action:** Carmustine is a bifunctional alkylating agent. It alkylates DNA and RNA, causing cross-linking of DNA strands, which inhibits DNA replication and RNA transcription. This leads to cell death. It is cell-cycle phase non-specific and is generally not cross-resistant with other alkylating agents, except possibly lomustine.


## **Alternate Names**

**International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Carmustine

**Brand Names:** BiCNU®, Gliadel®

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Carmustine's primary effect is cytotoxicity via alkylation of DNA and RNA, leading to cell death.  It is cell cycle phase nonspecific.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Administered intravenously or implanted directly into the brain (Gliadel wafer).
* **Distribution:** Highly lipophilic; crosses the blood-brain barrier readily, achieving CSF levels approximately 50% of plasma levels.
* **Metabolism:** Metabolized to active alkylating species.  Phenobarbital increases its metabolism.
* **Elimination:** 60-70% excreted in urine within 96 hours, 10% as respiratory CO2. Elimination half-life is approximately 0.25-0.75 h.



**Mode of Action (Cellular/Molecular Level):**  Alkylates DNA and RNA at the O6 position of guanine, causing crosslinking of DNA strands.  This inhibits DNA synthesis and function, ultimately leading to cell death.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** No known specific receptor binding or neurotransmitter modulation. Inhibits several enzymes by carbamoylation.

**Elimination Pathways:** Renal and pulmonary excretion, metabolism primarily hepatic, CYP enzymes are not significantly involved.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (IV):**

* **Single Agent:** 150-200 mg/m² every 6 weeks, as a single dose or divided into 75-100 mg/m² on two successive days.
* **Combination Therapy:** Dose adjustments are necessary; consult specific protocols.

#### **Children (IV):**

Use with extreme caution in children due to the high risk of pulmonary toxicity.  Dosage 200-250 mg/m² every 4-6 weeks may be utilized depending upon the child's individual tolerance.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start at the lower end of the dosing range due to increased risk of organ dysfunction. Monitor renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce dose based on creatinine clearance. 
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment may be necessary; monitor closely.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate on a case-by-case basis, especially for lung disease.



### **Clinical Use Cases:**

Dosing is determined by established protocols for specific cancers.

* **Brain Tumor (Gliadel Wafer):** Up to 8 wafers are implanted in the surgical resection cavity after tumor removal.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Adjustments are made based on hematologic response to the previous dose:

* **Leukocytes > 4,000/mm³ and Platelets > 100,000/mm³:** 100% of prior dose
* **Leukocytes 3,000-3,999/mm³ and Platelets 75,000-99,999/mm³:** 100% of prior dose
* **Leukocytes 2,000-2,999/mm³ and Platelets 25,000-74,999/mm³:** 70% of prior dose
* **Leukocytes < 2,000/mm³ and Platelets < 25,000/mm³:** 50% of prior dose


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, myelosuppression (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia), fatigue, anorexia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Pulmonary fibrosis (acute and delayed onset, up to 17 years later),  renal toxicity, secondary malignancies (leukemia).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Pulmonary fibrosis, secondary malignancies.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe myelosuppression, pulmonary toxicity, hepatic dysfunction, renal failure.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to carmustine or nitrosoureas
* Severe bone marrow suppression
* Severe renal impairment
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding
* Children and adolescents (< 18 years old)


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Cimetidine:** Increased myelosuppression
* **Phenobarbital:** Decreased carmustine efficacy due to increased metabolism
* **Phenytoin:** Decreased phenytoin levels
* **CYP450 Interactions:** Does not significantly interact with CYP enzymes, but may impact metabolism of other drugs metabolized by these enzymes.
* **Other Interactions:** Anticoagulants, NSAIDs, and platelet inhibitors may increase the risk of bleeding due to carmustine's thrombocytopenic effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Contraindicated in pregnancy (risk of teratogenicity and embryotoxicity).

**Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated as carmustine is present in breast milk.
