## **Usage**

Caroverine is prescribed for the management of:

* **Tinnitus:** A ringing or buzzing in the ears.
* **Vertigo:** A sensation of dizziness or spinning.
* **Smooth muscle spasms:** Involuntary contractions of the smooth muscles, especially in the gastrointestinal tract.
* **Cerebral circulatory disorders:** Conditions affecting blood flow in the brain.

Its pharmacological classifications include:

* **Smooth muscle relaxant:** Relaxes smooth muscles to relieve spasms.
* **Calcium channel blocker:** Blocks calcium channels, leading to vasodilation and reduced muscle contraction.
* **Glutamate antagonist:** Blocks glutamate receptors, potentially reducing neuronal excitability and offering neuroprotection.


Caroverine's mechanism of action involves multiple pathways:

* **Calcium channel blockade:** Widens blood vessels, decreases blood pressure, and enhances blood flow to the inner ear, alleviating tinnitus and vertigo.
* **Glutamate antagonism:**  Modulates glutamate activity by blocking NMDA and AMPA receptors, potentially reducing neuronal excitability and excitotoxicity, particularly helpful in tinnitus.
* **Antioxidant properties:** Contributes to its neuroprotective effects.

## **Alternate Names**

* Tinnicar (brand name)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Caroverine acts as a smooth muscle relaxant, calcium channel blocker, and glutamate antagonist. It affects blood flow to the inner ear, reduces neuronal excitability, and possesses antioxidant properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Readily absorbed after oral administration.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver.
* **Elimination:** Excreted through the kidneys. More specific information on CYP enzyme involvement is not consistently detailed in the available sources.

**Mode of Action:** At the cellular level, Caroverine primarily blocks calcium channels, causing vasodilation. It also acts as a competitive antagonist at AMPA receptors and a non-competitive antagonist at NMDA receptors, modulating glutamate activity and potentially preventing neuronal damage. It also demonstrates antioxidant properties. Elimination pathways are primarily renal, with hepatic metabolism playing a role.  Details of specific CYP enzyme interactions are not consistently provided.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral:** 20-40 mg three to four times daily. Maximum: 200 mg/day.
* **IV/IM:** 40-80 mg daily. Maximum: 200 mg/day.
* **Tinnitus:** Two 20 mg capsules twice daily for 3-6 months.

#### **Children:**

* Generally not recommended for children under 12 years of age. Adolescents (16+) may be prescribed under strict medical supervision with careful dosing considerations.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment may be necessary due to age-related decline in hepatic and renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Careful dose adjustments are required based on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose modification may be needed due to altered drug metabolism.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution in patients with hyperthyroidism, cardiac insufficiency, muscular weakness, glaucoma, or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Dose adjustments may be required.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Specific dosage guidelines for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not consistently defined in the available sources.  Dosing should be guided by clinical judgment and patient-specific factors.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications should be considered for renal/hepatic dysfunction, and other comorbid conditions.  Currently, there is limited information regarding specific dosage adjustments based on genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.
