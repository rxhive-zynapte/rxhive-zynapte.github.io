## **Usage**

Carvedilol is prescribed for:
- Hypertension (high blood pressure)
- Congestive heart failure (CHF)
- Left ventricular dysfunction following a myocardial infarction (heart attack)
- Angina pectoris (chest pain)

**Pharmacological Classification:**
Carvedilol is a nonselective beta-blocker with alpha-1 blocking activity and antioxidant properties.

**Mechanism of Action:**
Carvedilol blocks beta-adrenergic and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. Beta-blockade reduces heart rate and contractility, while alpha-1 blockade causes vasodilation, lowering peripheral vascular resistance. This combined effect leads to a decrease in blood pressure and improved cardiac function.  Carvedilol also possesses antioxidant properties, which may contribute to its cardioprotective effects.


## **Alternate Names**

Carvedilol is the generic name. Brand names include Coreg and Coreg CR (controlled-release).

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Carvedilol exerts its therapeutic effects through combined beta and alpha-1 adrenergic blockade. It reduces heart rate, myocardial contractility, and peripheral vascular resistance, leading to lower blood pressure and improved cardiac output in heart failure.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Carvedilol is absorbed orally and extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 enzymes. It has a bioavailability of approximately 25% to 35% due to significant first-pass metabolism. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within 1 to 2 hours for immediate-release formulations and 7 to 10 hours for extended-release formulations. Carvedilol is excreted mainly in the bile and feces, with a small portion eliminated in the urine. It has a half-life of about 7 to 10 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Carvedilol competitively binds to beta-1, beta-2, and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. This blockade inhibits the effects of catecholamines (such as norepinephrine and epinephrine) on these receptors, resulting in decreased heart rate, contractility, and vasodilation.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism via CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, followed by biliary excretion and fecal elimination. A minor portion is excreted renally.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Hypertension:**  Initial dose is 6.25 mg twice daily or 12.5 mg once daily for the first two days for immediate-release tablets, followed by 25 mg once daily. The dose can be titrated up to a maximum of 50 mg daily as tolerated. For extended-release capsules, 20 mg once daily initially, increased to 40 mg, and then up to 80 mg once daily if necessary.
* **Congestive Heart Failure:**  Initial dose is 3.125 mg twice daily for two weeks for immediate-release tablets.  The dose can be gradually increased to 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, and then 25 mg twice daily, as tolerated, at intervals of at least two weeks.  The maximum recommended dose is 25 mg twice daily for patients â‰¤ 85 kg and 50 mg twice daily for patients > 85 kg.  For extended-release capsules, 10 mg once daily, maintained for 1-2 weeks and titrated up to 20 mg, 40 mg, and then 80 mg once daily as needed.
* **Left Ventricular Dysfunction After MI:** Initial dose is 6.25 mg twice daily (or 3.125 mg twice daily initially if needed), with up-titration to 12.5 mg twice daily and then 25 mg twice daily over successive intervals of at least 3-10 days, using immediate-release tablets. For extended-release capsules, 20 mg once daily initially with up-titration over successive intervals of at least 3-10 days as tolerated to a maximum of 80 mg/day. 
* **Angina Pectoris:** 25-50 mg twice daily using immediate-release tablets.



#### **Children:**  The safety and efficacy of carvedilol have not been established in children.  Use and dose must be determined by a doctor.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  A lower starting dose of 12.5 mg once daily is recommended for hypertension. For CHF, start with 3.125 mg twice daily. Dosage increases should be done cautiously. Close monitoring is essential.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is typically needed.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Carvedilol is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment. Use with caution in mild to moderate hepatic impairment, starting with a low dose and titrating carefully.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and renal impairment should be closely monitored while adjusting dosage.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Carvedilol is not typically used in the context of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest. Its primary use is in the outpatient chronic management of heart failure, hypertension, left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction, and angina.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on patient response, tolerability, and renal/hepatic function. Slow and careful titration is recommended, particularly in elderly patients and those with hepatic impairment.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue
* Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Edema (swelling)
* Diarrhea
* Dry eyes

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Worsening heart failure
* Severe bradycardia or heart block
* Bronchospasm (difficulty breathing)
* Liver dysfunction

### **Long-Term Effects**

* Potential for worsening pre-existing heart failure if not titrated properly. 
* Mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia.
* May lead to bronchospasm and reduced peripheral circulation in susceptible individuals.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome


## **Contraindications**

* Asthma or bronchospastic conditions
* Second or third-degree heart block (unless a pacemaker is present)
* Severe bradycardia
* Cardiogenic shock
* Severe hepatic impairment
* Hypersensitivity to carvedilol


## **Drug Interactions**

* **CYP450 Interactions:**  Carvedilol is metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9. Inhibitors of these enzymes (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, amiodarone) may increase carvedilol levels. Inducers of these enzymes (e.g., rifampin) may decrease carvedilol levels.
* **Other Interactions:**
    * Calcium channel blockers: May increase the risk of bradycardia and hypotension.
    * Clonidine: May enhance hypotensive effects.
    * Digoxin: May increase digoxin levels.
    * Insulin or oral hypoglycemics: May mask symptoms of hypoglycemia.
    * Other beta-blockers: Additive effects and increased risk of side effects.
* **Food and Lifestyle Factors:** Alcohol can increase the hypotensive effects of carvedilol. Grapefruit juice may increase carvedilol levels.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (Australia);  Not assigned (US FDA).  Carvedilol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk.  Beta-blockers may reduce placental perfusion, potentially leading to fetal complications.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Carvedilol is excreted in breast milk. Use with caution during breastfeeding. Monitor the infant for potential side effects, such as bradycardia and hypotension. Consider using alternative medications if possible.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Nonselective beta-blocker with alpha-1 blocking activity.
