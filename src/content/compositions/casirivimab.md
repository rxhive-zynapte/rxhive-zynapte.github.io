Casirivimab is generally administered in combination with imdevimab for the treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.  It is not authorized for pre-exposure prophylaxis or for use in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19, requiring oxygen support due to COVID-19, or whose oxygen requirements have increased due to COVID-19. (As of February 16, 2025, this information may be subject to change, and consulting the latest medical guidelines is crucial.)

## **Usage**
- **Medical Conditions:**  Mild to moderate COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients at high risk for disease progression. Post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Monoclonal antibody, antiviral agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Casirivimab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) that targets the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. It binds to a specific region of the spike protein (receptor-binding domain or RBD), preventing the virus from attaching to and entering human cells, thereby neutralizing the virus.

## **Alternate Names** 
- REGN10933
- **Brand Names:**  (in combination with imdevimab) REGEN-COV, Ronapreve

## **How It Works**
- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Casirivimab binds to the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, inhibiting viral entry into host cells and reducing viral replication. This reduces viral load and the risk of severe disease progression.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  When administered intravenously, casirivimab reaches maximum serum concentrations rapidly. Following subcutaneous administration, peak serum concentrations are achieved in approximately 4 days. The drug is not metabolized by CYP enzymes and is primarily eliminated through non-renal pathways with a half-life ranging from approximately 2 to 4 weeks.  It's unlikely to interact with renally excreted medications or cytochrome P450 substrates, inducers, or inhibitors.
- **Mode of Action:** Receptor binding inhibition. Casirivimab specifically binds to the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, blocking the interaction with the human ACE2 receptor, which is necessary for viral entry into cells.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Non-renal pathways. It's unlikely to interact with renally excreted medications or cytochrome P450 substrates, inducers, or inhibitors.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**
#### **Adults:**  Casirivimab 600 mg and imdevimab 600 mg co-administered as a single intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injection as soon as possible after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and within 10 days of symptom onset (for treatment) or as soon as possible after exposure (for post-exposure prophylaxis). 

#### **Children (12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg):** Same as adult dosage.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is needed.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  The effect of hepatic impairment is unknown.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** The presence of comorbidities is a key factor in determining eligibility for Casirivimab/Imdevimab treatment, as it increases the risk of severe COVID-19. No dosage adjustment is required based on specific comorbidities.

### **Clinical Use Cases**
Casirivimab/imdevimab is **not** indicated for use in hospitalized patients or patients requiring oxygen support, mechanical ventilation, or ICU care due to COVID-19. It is intended for *outpatient* use.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
No dose adjustments are needed for elderly patients or those with renal impairment.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
- Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site
- Nausea
- Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., rash, itching, hives)
- Infusion-related reactions (e.g., fever, chills, flushing, headache, dizziness)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)

### **Long-Term Effects**
Data on long-term effects are still limited.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
- Anaphylaxis

## **Contraindications**
- Hypersensitivity to casirivimab, imdevimab, or any component of the formulation.
-  Age < 12 years and weight < 40 kg.
-  Hospitalized due to COVID-19, requiring oxygen support due to COVID-19, or increased oxygen requirements due to COVID-19.

## **Drug Interactions**
Limited data is available on drug interactions.  Clinically significant interactions have not been identified.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Limited data are available. The benefits of treatment might outweigh the risks in certain situations.  The decision to use Casirivimab/imdevimab should be made on a case-by-case basis after careful consultation with a healthcare provider.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Limited information is available. Due to the large molecular weight of casirivimab, breast milk excretion is expected to be low, and oral absorption by the infant is also expected to be low.

## **Drug Profile Summary**
- **Mechanism of Action:** Binds to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, blocking viral entry into host cells.
- **Side Effects:**  Injection site reactions, nausea, hypersensitivity reactions, infusion-related reactions, anaphylaxis (rare).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, age < 12 years and weight < 40 kg, hospitalized for COVID-19 or requiring oxygen support, increased oxygen requirements.
- **Drug Interactions:** Limited data; no known clinically significant interactions.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Limited data; assess benefit vs. risk individually.
- **Dosage:** 600 mg casirivimab + 600 mg imdevimab IV or SC, single dose.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for signs of hypersensitivity/infusion reactions during and after administration. 

## **Popular Combinations**
Casirivimab is most commonly co-administered with imdevimab (REGEN-COV, Ronapreve).

## **Precautions**
- Patients should be monitored during infusion and for at least 1 hour after administration for hypersensitivity reactions.
- The efficacy against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants should be considered.
