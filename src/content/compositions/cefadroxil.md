## **Usage**

Cefadroxil, a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, is primarily prescribed for treating bacterial infections susceptible to its action.  These include:

* **Upper respiratory tract infections:**  Pharyngitis, tonsillitis (caused by *Streptococcus pyogenes*)
* **Lower respiratory tract infections:** Bronchopneumonia, bacterial pneumonia (*Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Streptococcus pyogenes*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, *Staphylococcus aureus*)
* **Urinary tract infections:** Cystitis, pyelonephritis (*Escherichia coli*, *Proteus mirabilis*, *Klebsiella species*)
* **Skin and soft tissue infections:** Abscesses, furunculosis, impetigo, erysipelas, pyoderma, lymphadenitis (*Staphylococcus aureus*, *Streptococcus pyogenes*)


**Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic, specifically a first-generation cephalosporin.

**Mechanism of Action:** Cefadroxil inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This binding disrupts the transpeptidation process, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

Cefadroxil is also known as cefadroxil monohydrate (the monohydrate form) or cefadroxil hemihydrate. Brand names include Duricef and Ultracef.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cefadroxil exerts its bactericidal effect by disrupting the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. It preferentially targets actively growing bacteria.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Cefadroxil is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 70-90 minutes. Administration with food may enhance absorption and reduce gastrointestinal side effects.
* **Distribution:** Cefadroxil has a volume of distribution of approximately 0.31 L/kg and is about 20% protein-bound. It achieves therapeutic concentrations in various tissues and fluids, including urine.
* **Metabolism:**  Cefadroxil is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.  Minimal metabolism occurs.
* **Elimination:** Cefadroxil is predominantly eliminated via renal excretion (>90% within 24 hours), with a half-life of 1-2 hours in adults with normal renal function, 1.3-1.8 hours in children, and significantly prolonged (up to 24 hours) in adults with renal failure. Hemodialysis can remove a substantial portion of the drug.

**Mode of Action:** Cefadroxil binds to specific PBPs located on the inner bacterial cell membrane. These PBPs are crucial enzymes involved in the final stages of peptidoglycan synthesis, an essential component of the bacterial cell wall. By inhibiting PBPs, cefadroxil weakens the cell wall, leading to cell lysis and bacterial death.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of the unchanged drug.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Most infections:** 1-2 g/day orally, given as a single dose or divided every 12 hours.
* **Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis:** 1 g/day for 10 days. 
* **Urinary Tract Infections:** Up to 2g/day given as a single or in divided doses.


#### **Children:**

* **Most infections:** 30 mg/kg/day orally, given in a single dose or divided every 12 hours. Maximum dose:  Generally not exceeding 1 g/day, but up to 2 g/day has been used for certain indications.
* **Pharyngitis, Tonsillitis, Impetigo:** 30 mg/kg/day, given once daily or divided every 12 hours for 10 days.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary based on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment is crucial.  
    * CrCl >50 mL/min: No adjustment needed.
    * CrCl 25-50 mL/min: Administer every 12 hours.
    * CrCl 10-25 mL/min: Administer every 24 hours.
    * CrCl <10 mL/min: Administer every 36 hours. Hemodialysis patients require supplemental doses.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment typically needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor closely. Consider dose adjustments depending on interactions with other medications.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Cefadroxil is not typically the preferred agent for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations requiring rapid bacterial control. These scenarios often call for intravenous antibiotics offering broader coverage and rapid onset of action. Cefadroxil's use is generally restricted to mild-moderate infections treatable with oral administration.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

See "Special Cases" under "Standard Dosage".  Dosage modifications are crucial for patients with renal impairment, with adjustments based on creatinine clearance.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Cefadroxil is generally considered safe during pregnancy, but its use should be carefully weighed against potential risks. Consult guidelines for updated safety information.
* **Breastfeeding:** Cefadroxil passes into breast milk in low concentrations, posing minimal risk to infants.  However, monitor infants for diarrhea or thrush.
