## Usage

Cefditoren, a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, is prescribed for the treatment of various bacterial infections. These include:

* **Acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis:** Caused by susceptible strains of *Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae,* and *Moraxella catarrhalis*.
* **Community-acquired pneumonia:** Caused by susceptible strains of *Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae,* and *Staphylococcus aureus* (methicillin-susceptible strains).
* **Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis:**  Caused by susceptible strains of *Streptococcus pyogenes*.
* **Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections:** Caused by susceptible strains of *Staphylococcus aureus* (methicillin-susceptible strains) and *Streptococcus pyogenes*.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Cefditoren is classified as a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic.

**Mechanism of Action:** Cefditoren inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to and inactivating penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This leads to bacterial cell lysis and death.


## Alternate Names

Cefditoren is also known as cefditoren pivoxil (the prodrug form). Brand names include Spectracef, Meiact, and Zostom.


## How It Works

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Cefditoren exerts its bactericidal effect by disrupting bacterial cell wall synthesis.  It binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which are essential enzymes for the final steps of peptidoglycan synthesis.  This binding inhibits PBP cross-linking activity, leading to cell wall instability, lysis, and bacterial death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Cefditoren pivoxil, the orally administered prodrug, is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and rapidly hydrolyzed to the active cefditoren by esterases.  Food enhances absorption. It reaches peak plasma concentrations within 2 to 3 hours. Cefditoren has a volume of distribution of approximately 0.25 L/kg and is about 88% bound to plasma proteins.  Metabolism is minimal.  Cefditoren is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine, with a half-life of 1.6 hours. Renal excretion involves both glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.


## Dosage


### Standard Dosage

#### Adults:

* **Chronic Bronchitis:** 400 mg orally every 12 hours for 10 days.
* **Community-Acquired Pneumonia:** 400 mg orally every 12 hours for 14 days.
* **Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis, Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections:** 200 mg orally every 12 hours for 10 days.

#### Children:

* **Children under 12 years:** Not generally recommended. Some regional variations exist for granule formulations in specific infections like pneumonia or rhinosinusitis at dosages adjusted for weight, with a maximum daily dosage limit. These pediatric dosages should be based on local guidelines.
* **Children 12 years and older:** Same as adult dosing.

#### Special Cases:

* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is necessary with normal renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    * CrCl 30-49 mL/minute/1.73 m²: Maximum 200 mg every 12 hours.
    * CrCl <30 mL/minute/1.73 m²: Maximum 200 mg once daily.
    * End-stage renal disease: Dosage not established.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is necessary for mild to moderate impairment.  Use with caution in severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of penicillin allergy, gastrointestinal disease (especially colitis), seizure disorders, and those at risk for decreased prothrombin activity.


### Clinical Use Cases

Cefditoren is generally *not* indicated for use in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary use is for oral treatment of the specific infections mentioned previously.


### Dosage Adjustments

Dose adjustments are primarily based on renal function (see above).


## Side Effects

### Common Side Effects

Diarrhea, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, vaginal itching or discharge, rash.

### Rare but Serious Side Effects

* *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Seizures,  Anaphylaxis, Pseudomembranous colitis,  Hepatic dysfunction,  Renal dysfunction,  Blood dyscrasias.

### Long-Term Effects

Carnitine deficiency may occur with prolonged use.

### Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)

Anaphylaxis, severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis),  *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea,  Hepatitis,  Acute renal failure,  Agranulocytosis,  Thrombocytopenia.

## Contraindications

* Hypersensitivity to cefditoren or other cephalosporins.
* Carnitine deficiency or inborn errors of metabolism leading to carnitine deficiency.
* Milk protein hypersensitivity (due to the presence of sodium caseinate in some formulations).

## Drug Interactions

* **Antacids (aluminum or magnesium-containing):** Reduced cefditoren absorption. Administer at least 2 hours apart.
* **H2-receptor antagonists (e.g., famotidine):** Reduced cefditoren absorption.
* **Probenecid:** Increases cefditoren plasma concentration.
* **Anticoagulants:** May potentiate anticoagulant effects.
* **Bacteriostatic antibiotics:** May antagonize cefditoren's bactericidal activity.
* **Oral contraceptives:** Potential for reduced contraceptive efficacy (though not definitively established).


## Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

* **Pregnancy:**  Pregnancy Category B.  Use only if clearly needed.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Cefditoren is excreted in rat milk. Caution is advised in human breastfeeding.


## Drug Profile Summary

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins.
* **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, rare but serious effects include *C. difficile* infection, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, seizures.
* **Contraindications:**  Cephalosporin allergy, carnitine deficiency, milk protein hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Antacids, H2-receptor antagonists, probenecid, anticoagulants.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
* **Dosage:** Refer to detailed dosage section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, signs of superinfection (e.g., thrush, vaginal yeast infection),  signs of allergic reaction.


## Popular Combinations

Cefditoren is not typically used in combination with other antibiotics.


## Precautions

* History of penicillin allergy.
* Renal/hepatic impairment.
* Gastrointestinal disease (colitis).
* Seizure disorders.
* Monitor for signs of superinfection.
* Concomitant use of anticoagulants.
