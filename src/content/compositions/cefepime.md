## **Usage**

Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin antibiotic prescribed for the treatment of moderate to severe bacterial infections. These infections include:

* Pneumonia (including nosocomial pneumonia)
* Febrile neutropenia (empiric therapy)
* Complicated and uncomplicated urinary tract infections (including pyelonephritis)
* Complicated intra-abdominal infections (in conjunction with metronidazole)
* Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections

Its pharmacological classification is **antibiotic**.

Cefepime's mechanism of action involves inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This binding disrupts the cross-linking of peptidoglycans, leading to cell wall instability and bacterial lysis.


## **Alternate Names**

Cefepime hydrochloride is the chemical name.  Maxipime is a widely recognized brand name.  Different brand names may exist regionally.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cefepime exerts its bactericidal effect by disrupting bacterial cell wall synthesis. It has a broad spectrum of activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Cefepime is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is therefore administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). IV administration is the preferred route.
* **Distribution:**  It achieves therapeutic concentrations in various tissues and body fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid.  Protein binding is relatively low (around 20%).
* **Metabolism:** Cefepime is minimally metabolized.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated by renal excretion, with a half-life of approximately 2 hours in patients with normal renal function.

**Mode of Action:** Cefepime binds to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), specifically PBP 3, which are essential for bacterial cell wall synthesis. This inhibits the transpeptidation and carboxypeptidation reactions necessary for peptidoglycan cross-linking, leading to cell wall instability and ultimately bacterial cell death.  No significant enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation is associated with its mechanism.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily excreted unchanged via the kidneys.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Mild to Moderate Infections:** 0.5-1g IV/IM every 12 hours. IM administration is typically reserved for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by *E. coli*.
* **Severe Infections:** 1-2g IV every 8-12 hours.  For *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infections, 2g IV every 8 hours is recommended.
* **Administration:** IV infusions should be administered over approximately 30 minutes.

#### **Children (2 months to 16 years):**

* **Most Infections:** 50 mg/kg every 12 hours.
* **Febrile Neutropenia or Severe Pneumonia (caused by *P. aeruginosa*):** 50 mg/kg every 8 hours.
* **Maximum Dose:** Should not exceed the recommended adult dose.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance (CrCl) is necessary. Monitor renal function closely.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment is required based on CrCl (see dosage adjustments section).
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is typically necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Carefully assess patients with conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and seizure disorders.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing in specific clinical settings generally follows standard recommendations based on infection severity. Higher doses or more frequent administration might be necessary in critically ill patients.  Consult local guidelines and expert advice for specific protocols.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

**Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustments are necessary in adults and children with impaired renal function:

* **CrCl >60 mL/min:** Standard dosage.
* **CrCl 30-60 mL/min:** Reduce dosage or increase dosing interval.
* **CrCl 11-29 mL/min:** Further reduce dosage or increase dosing interval.
* **CrCl <11 mL/min:** Significant dose reduction or increase dosing interval.
* **Hemodialysis:** Administer after dialysis on dialysis days.  Specific protocols exist (see source materials).

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Diarrhea
* Nausea and vomiting
* Rash
* Headache
* Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site
* Fever

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* *Clostridium difficile* associated diarrhea (CDAD)
* Seizures (especially in patients with renal impairment receiving high doses)
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Stevens-Johnson Syndrome
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis
* Neutropenia
* Thrombocytopenia
* Renal dysfunction

### **Long-Term Effects:**  Long-term use of cefepime can lead to:

* Development of antibiotic resistance
* Superinfection with resistant organisms (e.g., fungal infections).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Clinically significant ADRs include:

* Anaphylaxis
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome/Toxic epidermal necrolysis
* Pseudomembranous colitis
* Drug-induced nephritis

## **Contraindications**

* **Absolute:** Known hypersensitivity to cefepime, other cephalosporins, penicillins, or any component of the formulation.
* **Relative:** History of non-severe hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics, asthma, allergic diathesis, seizure disorders.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Aminoglycosides:** Increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
* **Probenecid:** Increased cefepime serum levels.
* **Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin):** Enhanced anticoagulant effect.
* **Other nephrotoxic drugs:** Additive nephrotoxic effects.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Cefepime crosses the placenta. Limited human data available, animal studies have not shown adverse effects. Use only if clearly needed.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Cefepime is present in human milk in low concentrations. Exercise caution when administering to breastfeeding women.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
