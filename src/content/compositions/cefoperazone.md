## **Usage**

Cefoperazone is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat a wide variety of bacterial infections.  It is prescribed for infections caused by susceptible bacteria, including:

* **Respiratory Tract Infections:** Pneumonia, bronchitis, lung abscess.
* **Urinary Tract Infections:** Pyelonephritis, cystitis, urethritis.
* **Intra-abdominal Infections:** Peritonitis, cholecystitis, cholangitis.
* **Septicemia:** Bloodstream infections.
* **Meningitis:** Infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.
* **Skin and Soft Tissue Infections:** Cellulitis, abscesses, wound infections.
* **Infections of Bones and Joints:** Osteomyelitis, septic arthritis.
* **Gonorrhea:** Sexually transmitted infection.
* **Surgical Prophylaxis:** To prevent infections after surgery.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Cefoperazone is a beta-lactam antibiotic belonging to the cephalosporin class.  More specifically, it is a third-generation cephalosporin.

**Mechanism of Action:** Cefoperazone inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to and inactivating penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).  These proteins are essential for the cross-linking of peptidoglycans, which form the structural integrity of the bacterial cell wall.  This disruption leads to cell lysis and bacterial death.

## **Alternate Names**

Cefoperazone is the generic name. It is often marketed under various brand names globally, such as Cefobid and Magnemycin.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cefoperazone exerts its bactericidal effect by disrupting the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Cefoperazone is administered parenterally (intravenously or intramuscularly) as it is not well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
* **Distribution:** It achieves therapeutic concentrations in various tissues and fluids, including bile, where concentrations are significantly higher than serum levels.
* **Metabolism:** Cefoperazone is not extensively metabolized.
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted in the bile, with a small portion eliminated through the kidneys.  The serum half-life is typically 1.5 to 2.5 hours.

**Mode of Action:**  Cefoperazone binds to specific PBPs within the bacterial cell wall, inhibiting the transpeptidation reaction necessary for cross-linking peptidoglycans. This weakens the cell wall, leading to cell lysis and bacterial death.

**Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly biliary excretion, with minimal renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Standard Dose:** 2 to 4 grams daily, administered in equally divided doses every 12 hours, intravenously or intramuscularly.
* **Severe Infections:** Dosage may be increased up to 8 grams daily or even higher in exceptionally severe cases, divided and administered every 8 or 12 hours.
* **Uncomplicated Gonorrhea:** 500 mg as a single intramuscular dose.


#### **Children:**

* **Dosage:** 50 to 200 mg/kg/day, divided every 8 to 12 hours, intravenously or intramuscularly. The maximum dose should not exceed 12 grams/day.
* **Neonates (less than 8 days old):** Administer every 12 hours.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments are generally not necessary unless renal or hepatic impairment exists.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** For patients with creatinine clearance less than 18 ml/min or serum creatinine greater than 3.5 mg/dL, the maximum dosage should be 4 grams/day.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** In severe biliary obstruction or hepatic disease, reduce the dose to a maximum of 2 grams/day and monitor serum concentrations closely. For patients with combined renal and hepatic impairment, even closer monitoring is needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Adjust dosages based on the specific comorbidity and organ function.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in these settings follows the standard adult or pediatric recommendations, adjusting for severity and patient-specific factors:

* **Intubation**
* **Surgical Procedures:** 1-2 grams IV 30-90 minutes prior to surgery, repeated every 12 hours for no longer than 24 hours.
* **Mechanical Ventilation**
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
* **Emergency Situations**



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are based on creatinine clearance, hepatic function, and serum drug levels.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

* Pain at the injection site
* Diarrhea
* Nausea and vomiting
* Rash
* Eosinophilia (increased eosinophils)



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea
* Neutropenia (low neutrophil count)
* Bleeding disorders
* Pseudomembranous colitis
* Jaundice


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Limited data available.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Similar to rare but serious side effects.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to cefoperazone, other cephalosporins, or penicillins.



## **Drug Interactions**

* **Aminoglycosides:** Increased risk of nephrotoxicity. Monitor renal function.
* **Probenecid:** May increase cefoperazone serum levels.
* **Anticoagulants:** May enhance anticoagulant effects. Monitor coagulation parameters.
* **Alcohol:** Avoid alcohol during and for 72 hours after cefoperazone therapy due to a disulfiram-like reaction in some patients.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Cefoperazone crosses the placenta.  Use with caution during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Cefoperazone is excreted in breast milk. Exercise caution when administering to breastfeeding women.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to PBPs.
* **Side Effects:** Injection site pain, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, rash, eosinophilia. Serious side effects include allergic reactions, bleeding disorders, and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to cefoperazone, cephalosporins, or penicillins.
* **Drug Interactions:** Aminoglycosides, probenecid, anticoagulants, alcohol.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use cautiously.
* **Dosage:** See detailed dosage section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Renal function, liver function tests, prothrombin time/INR (especially with concurrent anticoagulant use), complete blood count, and signs of superinfection.


## **Popular Combinations**

Cefoperazone is sometimes combined with sulbactam (a beta-lactamase inhibitor) to broaden its spectrum of activity against bacteria that produce beta-lactamases.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess renal and hepatic function, monitor for hypersensitivity reactions, and observe for signs of superinfection.
* **Specific Populations:** See the dosage section for special considerations for pregnant/breastfeeding women, children, and the elderly.
