## **Usage**

Cefotaxime is a broad-spectrum, third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic prescribed for various bacterial infections.  Its pharmacological classification is antibiotic.  It exerts its bactericidal effect by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis, ultimately leading to cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

Cefotaxime sodium.  Brand names include Claforan.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cefotaxime disrupts bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which are essential for cross-linking peptidoglycans in the bacterial cell wall.  This inhibition weakens the cell wall, making the bacteria susceptible to osmotic lysis and death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Well-absorbed after intramuscular (IM) injection, reaching peak serum concentrations in approximately 30 minutes.  Achieves higher peak serum levels and faster onset of action when administered intravenously (IV).
* **Distribution:**  Widely distributed throughout the body, including cerebrospinal fluid, bone, and soft tissues.
* **Metabolism:** Partially metabolized in the liver to desacetylcefotaxime, an active metabolite.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated by the kidneys via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Some elimination also occurs through the biliary route.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Mild to Moderate Infections:** 1 g every 12 hours IM or IV.
* **Moderate to Severe Infections:** 1-2 g every 8 hours IM or IV.
* **Severe or Life-Threatening Infections:** 2 g every 6-8 hours, or up to 2 g every 4 hours IV.  Maximum daily dose: 12 g.


#### **Children:**

* **Neonates (0-7 days, <2 kg):** 50 mg/kg every 12 hours IV.
* **Neonates (0-7 days, ≥2 kg):** 50 mg/kg every 8 hours IV.
* **Infants (8 days - <1 month):** 50 mg/kg every 8 hours IV.
* **Children (1 month - 12 years, <50 kg):** 50-180 mg/kg/day IV divided every 4-6 hours.  Higher doses are used for more severe infections.
* **Children (≥12 years or ≥50 kg):** Same as adult dose.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are necessary if renal and hepatic function is normal. Monitor renal function, especially if administered with aminoglycosides.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Reduce the dose in patients with severe renal failure (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min). An initial loading dose of 1 g, followed by half the usual dose at the same frequency. For moderate renal impairment (CrCl 20-50 mL/min) no dosage adjustment is required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No dosage adjustment is typically required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with a history of penicillin allergy or colitis.


### **Clinical Use Cases:**

* **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use/Emergency Situations:**  Dosage depends on the indication and severity of infection.  Surgical prophylaxis: 1 g IV/IM 30-90 minutes prior to surgery.  For prolonged procedures (>4 hours), a 2 g dose is recommended. For liver transplants, 1g (or 2g for obese patients) is given with Ampicillin 60 min prior to surgical incision and repeated every 3 hours.
*  Meningitis: 2 g IV every 4-6 hours



### **Dosage Adjustments:** Monitor renal and hepatic function, especially in patients with renal impairment, when given with aminoglycosides.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:** Pain at the injection site, inflammation of the vein (phlebitis), diarrhea, nausea, vomiting.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:** Allergic reactions (rash, itching, hives, anaphylaxis), *Clostridium difficile* infection (pseudomembranous colitis),  Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, decreased white blood cell count (neutropenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis) , low platelet count (thrombocytopenia),  hemolytic anemia,  encephalopathy,  seizures (especially in patients with renal insufficiency),  hepatitis (occasionally with jaundice).


## **Contraindications**

Known allergy to cephalosporins or penicillins.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Aminoglycosides:** Increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
* **Probenecid:** Increased serum concentrations of cefotaxime.
* **Anticoagulants:**  May potentiate anticoagulant effects.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Cefotaxime is generally considered safe to use during pregnancy.  It is excreted in breast milk in small amounts.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis.
* **Side Effects:** Common: injection site reactions, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting. Serious:  allergic reactions, *C. difficile* infection, blood cell abnormalities, encephalopathy, seizures.
* **Contraindications:**  Hypersensitivity to cephalosporins.
* **Drug Interactions:** Aminoglycosides, probenecid, anticoagulants.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** Varies depending on infection and patient factors (see detailed dosage section).
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, hepatic function, complete blood count.

## **Popular Combinations**

Cefotaxime is often combined with metronidazole or clindamycin for mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections (e.g., intra-abdominal infections).

## **Precautions**

Obtain cultures before starting therapy.  Monitor for signs and symptoms of allergic reactions and superinfections (e.g., *C. difficile* infection, fungal infections). Reduce dose in renal impairment.
