## **Usage**

Cefpodoxime Proxetil is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic prescribed for various bacterial infections.  These include:

* **Upper Respiratory Tract Infections:** Pharyngitis, tonsillitis, sinusitis, otitis media.
* **Lower Respiratory Tract Infections:** Acute bronchitis, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia (excluding atypical pneumonia caused by organisms like *Legionella*, *Mycoplasma*, and *Chlamydia*).
* **Skin and Skin Structure Infections:** Uncomplicated skin infections, abscesses.
* **Urinary Tract Infections:** Cystitis (acute uncomplicated), pyelonephritis (complicated UTI).
* **Gonorrhea:** Uncomplicated gonococcal infections.
* **Typhoid fever**.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic (Cephalosporin, Third-generation).

**Mechanism of Action:** Cefpodoxime inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), leading to bacterial cell lysis and death.

## **Alternate Names**

Cefpodoxime is the active metabolite. Cefpodoxime proxetil is the prodrug.

**Brand Names:** Vantin, Sefpotec, and others.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cefpodoxime exerts bactericidal action by disrupting the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell walls. This inhibition prevents the formation of a stable cell wall, resulting in cell lysis.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Cefpodoxime proxetil is well-absorbed orally. Food enhances absorption. Bioavailability is approximately 50%.
* **Metabolism:** Cefpodoxime proxetil is rapidly hydrolyzed to the active metabolite, cefpodoxime, during absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Minimal metabolism occurs in vivo.
* **Distribution:** Widely distributed throughout the body, including skin blister fluid.  Volume of distribution is around 32.3 liters.  Plasma protein binding is relatively low (21-29%).
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. Approximately 29-33% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine within 12 hours. Elimination half-life is around 2-4 hours, potentially prolonged in elderly patients and those with renal impairment.

**Mode of Action:** Cefpodoxime acts by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), specifically PBPs 1A, 1B, and 3. This binding interferes with the transpeptidation and transglycosylation reactions necessary for peptidoglycan synthesis, a critical component of the bacterial cell wall.  The disruption of cell wall integrity ultimately leads to cell death.

**Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly renal excretion (approximately 70%), with minimal hepatic metabolism.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Most infections:** 200 mg every 12 hours.
* **Uncomplicated UTIs:** 100 mg every 12 hours.
* **Uncomplicated Gonorrhea:** Single dose of 200 mg.

#### **Children (2 months - 12 years):**

* 5 mg/kg every 12 hours (maximum single dose of 200 mg).

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is needed unless renal function is impaired.  Monitor renal function due to potential increased half-life.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    * CrCl 30-40 mL/min: Administer the usual dose every 24 hours.
    * CrCl < 30 mL/min: Administer the usual dose every 24 hours.
    * Hemodialysis: Administer the usual dose every 48 hours or three times weekly after dialysis.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions (e.g., Diabetes):** Monitor renal function and adjust dosage as needed based on creatinine clearance. Studies indicate that patients with diabetes may have altered pharmacokinetics of cefpodoxime.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Cefpodoxime proxetil is primarily administered orally, and there are no specific dosage recommendations for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations requiring intravenous administration. In such settings, other cephalosporins formulated for intravenous use are more appropriate.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments based on renal function are essential. (See "Special Cases" above). Monitor for drug interactions that may impact cefpodoxime metabolism. Consider therapeutic drug monitoring in critically ill patients to ensure adequate drug levels.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Headache
* Rash
* Vaginal infections

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea (CDAD)
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

No specific long-term effects have been consistently reported, but prolonged use may lead to antibiotic resistance or *C. difficile* infection.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis), severe skin reactions (SJS/TEN), CDAD, and significant changes in renal function or prothrombin activity. These ADRs necessitate immediate medical attention.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to cefpodoxime or other cephalosporins.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Antacids and H2 blockers:** Reduce cefpodoxime absorption.
* **Probenecid:** Increases cefpodoxime levels.
* **Anticoagulants:** May increase bleeding risk.
* **Aminoglycosides/Potent diuretics:** Increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
* **Oral contraceptives:** Efficacy may be reduced.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:** B (Animal studies have not demonstrated fetal risk, but adequate studies in pregnant women are lacking). Use with caution, weighing the benefits against potential risks.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Cefpodoxime is excreted in breast milk in low concentrations.  Monitor infant for diarrhea or rash. Consider alternative safer options or interrupt breastfeeding temporarily.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to PBPs.
* **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, rash, headache; rarely CDAD, allergic reactions, SJS/TEN.
* **Contraindications:**  Hypersensitivity to cefpodoxime or cephalosporins.
* **Drug Interactions:** Antacids, H2 blockers, probenecid, anticoagulants, oral contraceptives.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category B; excreted in breast milk; use with caution.

* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, prothrombin time (if on anticoagulants), signs of superinfection (e.g., CDAD).

## **Popular Combinations**

Not applicable. Cefpodoxime is typically used as monotherapy. Combining it with other antibiotics is usually not recommended unless specifically indicated for complex infections.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess renal function, history of drug allergies (especially to penicillins or cephalosporins), and consider potential drug interactions.
