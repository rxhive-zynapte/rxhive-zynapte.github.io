## **Usage**

Ceftibuten is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic prescribed for various bacterial infections. It is commonly used to treat:

* **Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis:** Caused by *Streptococcus pyogenes* (Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci)
* **Acute Otitis Media (AOM):**  In children caused by susceptible bacteria.
* **Acute Bacterial Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis:** In adults.
* **Acute Bacterial Sinusitis:** In adults.
* **Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs):** Off-label use.


**Pharmacological Classification:** Ceftibuten is classified as a beta-lactam antibiotic, specifically a third-generation cephalosporin.


**Mechanism of Action:** Ceftibuten inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This disruption leads to bacterial cell death. It offers broader gram-negative coverage compared to earlier cephalosporin generations.


## **Alternate Names**

While "Ceftibuten" is the generic name, it's marketed under various brand names, most notably **Cedax**.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ceftibuten exerts bactericidal effects by binding to PBPs, disrupting cell wall synthesis. It exhibits activity against a wider spectrum of gram-negative bacteria than earlier generations.


**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Orally administered ceftibuten is rapidly absorbed, though food can slightly delay and reduce peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and overall extent of absorption (AUC).  The capsule and oral suspension formulations exhibit bioequivalence.
* **Metabolism:** Ceftibuten undergoes minimal metabolism. The primary metabolite is ceftibuten-trans, found in low concentrations.
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted unchanged through the kidneys. Dose adjustments are required in patients with renal impairment. Hemodialysis necessitates supplemental dosing.


**Mode of Action:**  Ceftibuten targets PBPs crucial for bacterial cell wall integrity.  Inhibiting these enzymes weakens the cell wall, leading to cell lysis and death.



**Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Standard Dose:** 400 mg orally once daily for 10 days.
* **Administration:** Can be taken with or without food (capsules). Suspension should be taken on an empty stomach (2 hours before or 1 hour after meals).



#### **Children (6 months and older):**

* **Standard Dose:** 9 mg/kg orally once daily (up to a maximum of 400 mg/day) for 10 days.
* **Pediatric Safety Considerations:** Safety and efficacy have not been established for infants under 6 months of age. Close monitoring is essential for all pediatric patients.
* **Administration:** Suspension should be taken on an empty stomach (2 hours before or 1 hour after meals).


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Standard adult dosage, but close monitoring of renal function is recommended, as dose adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    * CrCl 30-49 mL/min: 200 mg or 4.5 mg/kg once daily.
    * CrCl 5-29 mL/min: 100 mg or 2.25 mg/kg once daily.  Supplemental dosing after hemodialysis.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is typically needed.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Ceftibuten's standard dosage applies to common infections like pharyngitis/tonsillitis, AOM, bronchitis, and acute bacterial sinusitis. It's not typically the first-line agent in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Vomiting
* Abdominal Pain
* Dyspepsia
* Dizziness


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea
* Seizures
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
*  Stevens-Johnson Syndrome
* Serum Sickness
* Erythema Multiforme


## **Contraindications**

* Known hypersensitivity to cephalosporins.



## **Drug Interactions**

* **Probenecid:** Increases ceftibuten serum levels.
* **H2-receptor antagonists (e.g., ranitidine, famotidine):** May affect absorption.
* **Antacids:** May affect absorption.
* **Oral contraceptives:**  Potential for decreased efficacy of oral contraceptives, particularly those containing estrogen. Concurrent use of a backup birth control method may be advisable. 
* **Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin):** Increased risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of INR (International Normalized Ratio) required.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Category B.  Animal studies have not demonstrated fetal harm.  Use only when clearly needed. 
* **Breastfeeding:**  Ceftibuten is excreted in breast milk in small amounts.  Monitor infants for potential side effects, such as diarrhea or candidiasis (thrush).



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to PBPs.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, diarrhea, headache, vomiting, abdominal pain, and allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to cephalosporins.
* **Drug Interactions:** Probenecid, H2 blockers, antacids, oral contraceptives, anticoagulants.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category B; use with caution if clearly needed. Excreted in breast milk in small amounts.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 400 mg once daily. Children: 9 mg/kg once daily (up to 400 mg).
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function (especially in the elderly and renally impaired), signs of superinfection, and allergic reactions.

## **Popular Combinations**

Ceftibuten is not typically combined with other antibiotics.



## **Precautions**

* History of penicillin allergy
* History of gastrointestinal disease, especially colitis
* Renal impairment
* Seizure disorders
