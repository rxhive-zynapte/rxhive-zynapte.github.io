## **Usage**

Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic prescribed for a wide range of bacterial infections.  Its pharmacological classification is antibacterial/antibiotic. It exerts its bactericidal effect by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis, ultimately leading to cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

Ceftriaxone is also known internationally by the same name. Brand names include Rocephin, Ceftriax, Biotraxon, Cefaxone, and many others depending on the region and manufacturer.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ceftriaxone disrupts the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).  This binding inhibits the cross-linking of peptidoglycan chains, weakening the cell wall and causing bacterial lysis.  

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Ceftriaxone is well-absorbed after intramuscular administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 2-3 hours. Intravenous administration results in immediate peak concentrations.
* **Distribution:**  Widely distributed throughout the body, including cerebrospinal fluid, achieving therapeutic levels in meningitis.  Highly protein-bound (85-95%).
* **Metabolism:**  Minimal metabolism.
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted unchanged through renal (50-60%) and hepatic (40-50%, biliary excretion) pathways. The elimination half-life is approximately 8 hours in adults with normal renal function and may be prolonged in patients with renal impairment. No significant removal by hemodialysis.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

1-2 g IV or IM once daily. For severe infections, up to 4 g daily in single or divided doses.  IV doses greater than 2g should be administered by infusion over at least 30 minutes.

#### **Children:**

* **Neonates (up to 14 days):** 20-50 mg/kg once daily (maximum 50 mg/kg/day).  IV administration should be infused over 60 minutes.
* **Infants and children (15 days to 12 years, <50 kg):** 20-80 mg/kg/day once daily (maximum 4g daily, administered over at least 30 minutes).
* **Children ≥12 years or ≥ 50kg:** Same as adult dose.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment generally not required unless significant renal or hepatic impairment exists.  Caution with doses exceeding 2g daily if impaired renal and liver function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary in severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 10 mL/min). Maximum dose 2 g daily.  No supplemental dose needed after dialysis, but plasma level monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments usually unnecessary if renal function is normal.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate individually, considering drug interactions and disease states.


### **Clinical Use Cases:**

Dosages provided are general guidelines and may need to be adjusted based on the specific pathogen, severity of infection, and patient characteristics.  Always consider local treatment guidelines.

* **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:** 1-2 g IV/IM as a single preoperative dose 30-90 minutes before the procedure, or depending on the surgical procedure and the perceived risk of infection.
* **Meningitis:** 2 g IV every 12 hours for 7-14 days (adults). In pediatric cases, initiate with 100 mg/kg (up to 4 g) once daily, adjusting after pathogen identification and susceptibility testing.
* **Emergency Situations (Sepsis):** 2-4g daily IV/IM in single or divided doses, according to the severity of the infection.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Consider renal and hepatic function and other comorbid conditions. Therapeutic drug monitoring can be useful in severe infections and impaired organ function.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Pain, tenderness, or induration at the injection site, diarrhea, rash, eosinophilia, elevated liver enzymes.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema), *Clostridium difficile* colitis (pseudomembranous colitis), seizures, encephalopathy (especially in patients with renal impairment or CNS disorders), hemolytic anemia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

With prolonged use, potential for superinfection, vitamin K deficiency, and biliary pseudolithiasis.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe hypersensitivity reactions, severe diarrhea, signs of acute renal failure, hematological abnormalities, evidence of gallbladder disease, neurological changes.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to cephalosporins or penicillin.  Neonates (≤ 28 days) requiring treatment with calcium-containing IV solutions. Premature neonates up to 41 weeks postmenstrual age (gestational age + chronological age) especially with hyperbilirubinemia.  Concomitant use of IV ceftriaxone and calcium solutions in neonates, due to the risk of precipitation.

## **Drug Interactions**

Ceftriaxone can interact with:

* **Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin):** May potentiate anticoagulant effect.
* **Calcium-containing solutions:** Risk of precipitation in neonates.
* **Probenecid:** Reduced renal clearance of ceftriaxone.
* **Other antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol):** May enhance or reduce efficacy, monitor for adverse effects.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  FDA Pregnancy Category B.  Generally considered safe, but weigh benefits versus potential risks.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Low levels are excreted in breast milk. Generally considered safe, but monitor infant for diarrhea, thrush, or other signs of gastrointestinal upset.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis.
* **Side Effects:** Injection site reactions, diarrhea, rash; rarely, allergic reactions, colitis, seizures.
* **Contraindications:** Cephalosporin/penicillin hypersensitivity, neonates receiving calcium-containing IV solutions.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Anticoagulants, calcium-containing solutions, probenecid.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe, but consider individual circumstances.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 1-2 g daily; children: weight-based.  Adjust for renal impairment.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Renal and liver function, complete blood count during prolonged therapy, signs of superinfection.

## **Popular Combinations**

Ceftriaxone is often used in combination with other antibiotics, such as metronidazole, for synergistic effects in treating intra-abdominal infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and other mixed infections.


## **Precautions**

Caution in patients with a history of gastrointestinal disorders, renal/hepatic impairment, bleeding disorders, or allergies to other beta-lactams.  Monitor for superinfection and adverse reactions.  Evaluate renal and hepatic function, especially during prolonged treatment.
