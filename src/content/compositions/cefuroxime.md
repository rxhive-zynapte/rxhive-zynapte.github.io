## **Usage**

Cefuroxime is a second-generation cephalosporin antibiotic prescribed for various bacterial infections. These include:

* **Respiratory tract infections:** Pharyngitis, tonsillitis, acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and community-acquired pneumonia.
* **Urinary tract infections:** Uncomplicated and complicated cystitis and pyelonephritis.
* **Skin and soft tissue infections:** Impetigo, uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections.
* **Other infections:** Gonorrhea, Lyme disease, early Lyme disease, otitis media, and meningitis.
* **Surgical prophylaxis:** Prevention of infections following surgical procedures such as cardiovascular, esophageal, gastrointestinal, gynecological, and orthopedic operations.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Antibiotic.

**Mechanism of Action:** Cefuroxime inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This binding disrupts the cross-linking of peptidoglycans, essential components of the bacterial cell wall, ultimately leading to bacterial cell lysis and death.

## **Alternate Names**

Cefuroxime axetil (oral formulation)

**Brand names:** Ceftin, Zinacef, Zinnat.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cefuroxime exerts its bactericidal action by interfering with bacterial cell wall synthesis. It has a broad spectrum of activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Cefuroxime axetil, the oral prodrug, is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and hydrolyzed to active cefuroxime. Absorption is enhanced when taken with food.
* **Distribution:** Cefuroxime is widely distributed in the body, achieving therapeutic concentrations in various tissues and fluids, including bone, pleural fluid, sputum, and cerebrospinal fluid. Protein binding is approximately 33% to 50%.
* **Metabolism:** Cefuroxime axetil is metabolized to the active compound cefuroxime.
* **Elimination:** Cefuroxime is primarily eliminated by the kidneys via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion.  The elimination half-life is approximately 1 to 2 hours in adults with normal renal function.

**Mode of Action:** Cefuroxime inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to and inactivating PBPs, leading to cell lysis.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Cefuroxime acts by binding to PBPs, not receptors, enzymes, or neurotransmitters.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral:** 250 to 500 mg twice daily.
* **IV/IM:** 750 mg to 1.5 g every 8 hours.


#### **Children:**

* **Oral:** 10 to 15 mg/kg twice daily (maximum 1 g/day).
* **IV/IM:**  30 to 100 mg/kg/day divided every 6 to 8 hours (maximum 6 g/day). Neonates: 30 to 100 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is generally necessary unless renal impairment is present.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment is necessary based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No dosage adjustment is usually required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments may be needed in patients with severe infections, diabetes, or other comorbid conditions. Consider consulting an infectious disease specialist or a clinical pharmacist specialized in infectious diseases.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:** 1.5 g IV at induction of anesthesia, followed by 750 mg every 8 hours.
* **Emergency Situations:**  Higher doses (up to 3 g every 8 hours for meningitis) may be required depending on the severity of the infection.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are primarily required in patients with renal impairment. See above, under "Standard Dosage/Special Cases/Patients with Renal Impairment."


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Rash
* Pain at injection site


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Seizures (with high doses or renal impairment)
* Anaphylaxis (rare)
* Serum sickness
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome
* Thrombocytopenia


### **Long-Term Effects:** Potential long-term effects primarily relate to *Clostridium difficile* infection or antibiotic-associated colitis.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Anaphylaxis, severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), hematological adverse effects.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to cefuroxime or other cephalosporins.
* History of severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to any beta-lactam antibiotic.



## **Drug Interactions**

* Probenecid: Reduces renal excretion of cefuroxime, increasing serum levels.
* Oral anticoagulants: May potentiate the anticoagulant effect.
* Aminoglycosides and loop diuretics: Increased risk of nephrotoxicity when used concurrently.
* Antacids: May decrease cefuroxime absorption.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  B.
* **Fetal Risks:** No demonstrated teratogenic effects in animal studies. Use with caution during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester.
* **Breastfeeding:** Cefuroxime is excreted in breast milk. Use with caution in breastfeeding mothers. Monitor the infant for potential side effects, such as diarrhea or rash.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to PBPs.
* **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, rash, pain at injection site (common); *C. difficile* infection, seizures, anaphylaxis (rare).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to cephalosporins; history of severe hypersensitivity to beta-lactams.

* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Caution advised. Category B.
* **Dosage:**  See detailed dosage guidelines above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Renal function (creatinine clearance), signs of superinfection (*C. difficile*), prothrombin time (if co-administered with warfarin), liver function tests, complete blood counts.

## **Popular Combinations**

Cefuroxime is often used alone. When part of a combination therapy, other drugs included might depend on the infection treated.

## **Precautions**

* Renal function monitoring is important, especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment.
* Caution is advised in patients with a history of penicillin allergy, as cross-reactivity may occur.
