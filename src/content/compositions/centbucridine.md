## **Usage**

- Centbucridine is a local anesthetic used for topical, infiltration, and nerve block anesthesia.  It's indicated for various surgical procedures, including ophthalmic and dental surgeries. It's also utilized in wound healing gels combined with Feracrylum.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Local anesthetic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Centbucridine blocks nerve conduction by inhibiting sodium channels, thus preventing the transmission of pain signals.

## **Alternate Names**

- 4-N-butylamino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine hydrochloride
- Brand names include Hemolok AR Gel, Sepgard AR Gel, and Supraheal AR Gel.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Centbucridine reversibly binds to sodium channels within nerve fibers, inhibiting sodium ion influx. This prevents depolarization and blocks nerve impulse conduction, effectively inhibiting pain signal transmission. It also exhibits some vasoconstrictor properties.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Absorption: Rapid absorption from the administration site.
    - Metabolism: Not extensively studied.
    - Elimination: Not extensively studied. Details on elimination pathways (renal/hepatic excretion) and CYP enzyme metabolism are lacking in the current literature.
- **Mode of Action:** Sodium channel blocker.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Binds to sodium channels, inhibiting nerve impulse transmission.  No documented CYP450 interactions have been identified.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Infiltration Anesthesia: 0.5% solution, 2 mg/kg up to a maximum of 20 mg.
- Topical Anesthesia (Ophthalmic): 0.5% or 1% solution, single drop instillation.

#### **Children:**

- Limited data available. Dosing should be adjusted based on weight and age under specialist guidance with close monitoring for variations in drug metabolism.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment may be necessary based on individual health and organ function. Initiate with lower doses and monitor closely.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose modification is recommended based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Adjustment may be necessary due to potential altered metabolism. Commence with lower doses and monitor closely.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution and potential dose modifications for patients with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, or other relevant comorbidities.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation:** Limited data; lower doses advised.
- **Surgical Procedures (Minor):** 0.5% solution for infiltration anesthesia.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** No specific recommendations.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** No specific recommendations.
- **Emergency Situations:** No specific recommendations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Consider modifications for patients with renal/hepatic impairment, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Burning sensation (especially with topical use)
- Dizziness
- Headache
- Pins and needles sensation
- Muscle twitchiness
- Continued numbness in the affected area

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Systemic toxicity (with high doses or inadvertent intravascular injection)
- Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis
- Seizures
- Cardiac arrest

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- No long-term side effects specifically reported.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Anaphylaxis (rare but serious)



## **Contraindications**

- Known hypersensitivity to centbucridine or any formulation component.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Other local anesthetics: Additive effects may occur if used concurrently.
- Medications affecting cardiac conduction: Use with caution in patients taking antiarrhythmic medications.
- Epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA): Contraindicated for concomitant use with centbucridine + feracrylum combination.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** No official FDA classification assigned. Use with caution during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, due to limited data on fetal risks.
- **Breastfeeding:** No specific data available regarding breast milk excretion. Use with caution and monitor the infant for adverse effects. Topical application of centbucridine + feracrylum is considered probably safe.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Sodium channel blocker, inhibiting nerve impulse transmission.
- **Side Effects:** Burning sensation, rare systemic toxicity, allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to centbucridine, concomitant EACA use (when used in combination with feracrylum).
- **Drug Interactions:** Other local anesthetics, medications affecting cardiac conduction, EACA (with feracrylum combination).
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution. Topical feracrylum + centbucridine combination probably safe during lactation.
- **Dosage:** Refer to the detailed dosage section above.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Vital signs, especially respiratory and cardiovascular function.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Feracrylum: Used in wound healing gels.  Combines the antiseptic and hemostatic properties of feracrylum with the local anesthetic and antimicrobial effects of centbucridine.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess patient history for allergies and contraindications. Monitor vital signs during and after administration.
- **Pregnant Women:** Use with caution, especially during the first trimester.
- **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Use cautiously and monitor infant for side effects. Topical combination probably safe.
