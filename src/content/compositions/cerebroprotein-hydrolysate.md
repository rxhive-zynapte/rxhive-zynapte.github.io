## **Usage**

- Cerebroprotein Hydrolysate is prescribed for managing various neurological conditions, including stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and other forms of dementia.  It is also used to support cognitive function in age-related cognitive decline and to treat attention deficit disorders.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Neurotrophic and neuroprotective agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Cerebroprotein Hydrolysate acts on the central nervous system by stimulating the production of neurotrophic factors like brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), which promote the survival, differentiation, and repair of neurons. It also exhibits neuroprotective effects by reducing excitotoxic damage, blocking the overactivation of calcium-dependent proteases, and scavenging free oxygen radicals. It also regulates and improves neuronal metabolism and modulates synaptic plasticity.


## **Alternate Names**

- Cerebrolysin (brand name)
- CEREBROCIP (brand name)
- CEREHENZ (brand name)
- Cerebrogen (brand name)
- Cerebport (brand name)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Cerebroprotein Hydrolysate's main effect is to promote neuronal survival, growth, and differentiation, leading to improved cognitive function, nerve repair, and neuroprotection.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  The drug can be administered orally, intramuscularly (IM), or intravenously (IV). Absorption varies depending on the route of administration.  Metabolism and elimination pathways are not fully elucidated, but it is believed to be primarily metabolized in the liver. More research is needed to fully understand the pharmacokinetic profile in humans. 
- **Mode of Action:**  Stimulates the production of neurotrophic factors (BDNF and NGF), which promote neuronal survival and differentiation.  It also reduces excitotoxic damage, blocks calcium-dependent proteases, and acts as a free radical scavenger.  It further regulates neuronal metabolism and modulates synaptic plasticity. These actions contribute to neuronal repair and neuroprotection.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** While its exact mechanism is not fully understood, it modulates several signaling pathways including the Shh/Ptch-1/Gli-1 signaling pathway, which is essential in neuronal development and repair.  More research is needed for a comprehensive understanding of its interactions at the cellular and molecular levels.
- **Elimination Pathways:** The exact elimination pathways have yet to be fully characterized.  It is believed to undergo metabolism primarily in the liver.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- IV Infusion: 60-180 mg (calculated by total nitrogen) dissolved in 10-15 ml sterile water for injection, then further diluted in 250 ml normal saline and infused slowly over 60-120 minutes. 
- IM Injection: 30 mg reconstituted with 5ml sterile water.
- Oral: 90 - 180mg via capsules or tablets
- Treatment duration is typically 10-20 days of daily administration, followed by a maintenance dose of 30 mg IM injection two to three times a week, depending on the patient's condition and response. This may be repeated over several treatment cycles for long-term management.

#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy in children below 18 years have not been fully established. Use only under strict medical supervision and after careful consideration of the benefit-risk ratio. Pediatric dosages should be adjusted based on age and weight, and are generally lower than adult doses.



#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution due to potential increased sensitivity to side effects and possible underlying health conditions. Close monitoring is recommended. Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient characteristics.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Contraindicated in severe renal insufficiency.  Caution is advised in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment; dosage adjustments may be required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Limited information is available. Use with caution, as the drug is primarily metabolized in the liver.  Dosage adjustments may be required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with seizures, epilepsy, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, or autoimmune disorders. Dosage adjustments and close monitoring may be necessary.
