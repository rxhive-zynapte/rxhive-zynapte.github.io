      ALK-positive NSCLC.  Concomitant use of other medications requires a

      What should be done if a patient misses a dose of Ceritinib?**

      **A:** If a dose is missed and it is less than 12 hours until the next
      dose, skip the missed dose and return to the regular schedule. If more
      than 12 hours have passed, the missed dose should be taken as soon as
      possible, then resume the regular schedule.

## **Usage**

- Ceritinib is prescribed for the treatment of patients with metastatic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed on or are intolerant to crizotinib.  A diagnostic test should be performed to confirm ALK-positive status.
- **Pharmacological classification:**  Ceritinib is an antineoplastic agent, specifically a kinase inhibitor.
- **Mechanism of action:** Ceritinib inhibits ALK tyrosine kinase activity, disrupting the signaling pathways involved in the growth and survival of cancer cells.

## **Alternate Names**

- Zykadia (brand name)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ceritinib selectively targets and inhibits ALK, thereby hindering tumor growth and potentially inducing apoptosis (programmed cell death) in ALK-positive cancer cells.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Ceritinib is administered orally and its bioavailability is increased when taken with food.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by the liver, specifically by CYP3A4 enzyme.
    - **Elimination:** Predominantly eliminated via hepatic routes (feces), with negligible renal excretion.
- **Mode of action:** Ceritinib binds to and inhibits the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase, thus blocking downstream signaling pathways that promote cancer cell proliferation and survival. This leads to cell cycle arrest and ultimately cell death in ALK-positive tumor cells.
- **Receptor binding/Enzyme inhibition:**  Ceritinib exhibits potent and selective inhibition of ALK. It also inhibits other kinases to a lesser extent, including insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and ROS1 (c-ros oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase).
- **Elimination pathways:** Hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion are the primary elimination pathways, with minimal renal clearance.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 450 mg orally once daily with food.
- Continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

#### **Children:**

- 500 mg/m² orally once daily with food.
- Safety and efficacy have not been fully established in pediatric patients. Treatment should be determined by a pediatric oncologist.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients (≥65 years):** No dose adjustment is generally required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is needed for mild to moderate renal impairment. Use with caution in severe renal impairment. No data available for patients on dialysis.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** For severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), reduce the dose by approximately one-third (rounded to the nearest multiple of 150 mg). No adjustment necessary for mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A or B).
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Monitor patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or electrolyte imbalances for potential exacerbation of their conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Ceritinib is specifically indicated for ALK-positive NSCLC and is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Refer to the **Standard Dosage** and **Special Cases** sections for detailed dosage adjustments based on age, organ dysfunction, and concomitant medications. Dose reductions may also be required for managing adverse reactions. See side effects section.
