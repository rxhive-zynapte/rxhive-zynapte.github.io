## **Usage**

Cerivastatin was prescribed for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia, including type IIa and IIb. It belongs to the pharmacological class of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins.  Cerivastatin worked by inhibiting  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. This inhibition led to a decrease in hepatic cholesterol production, which in turn increased the number of LDL receptors on liver cells, promoting the removal of LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream.

## **Alternate Names**

Cerivastatin's most recognized brand name was Baycol.  However, this drug was withdrawn from the market in 2001 due to safety concerns.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cerivastatin primarily reduced LDL cholesterol levels. It also showed modest reductions in triglycerides and a slight increase in HDL cholesterol.  The main cholesterol-lowering effect was attributed to the parent drug itself.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Cerivastatin was rapidly and almost completely absorbed following oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations reached within 2-3 hours. Food or time of administration did not significantly impact absorption.
* **Metabolism:** Cerivastatin was extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system, particularly CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. The metabolites M1 and M23 were the primary forms excreted.
* **Elimination:** The parent drug, cerivastatin, was not found in urine or feces. Metabolites were excreted through both renal and hepatic pathways. Elimination half-life was approximately 2-3 hours, reaching steady-state plasma concentrations within a few days.


**Mode of Action:** Cerivastatin competitively inhibited HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, which is essential for cholesterol synthesis. This inhibition reduced intracellular cholesterol levels, leading to increased LDL receptor expression on hepatocytes and enhanced clearance of LDL cholesterol from circulation.

## **Dosage**

Cerivastatin is no longer available on the market and therefore dosage information is not relevant. It was withdrawn from the market in 2001 due to safety concerns, particularly an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Common side effects included:

- Gastrointestinal issues (gas, bloating, nausea, stomach upset, heartburn, indigestion, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea)
- Dizziness and headache
- Rash, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose
- Joint pain and muscle aches
- Flu-like symptoms and weakness

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

The most serious side effect was rhabdomyolysis, a potentially fatal breakdown of skeletal muscle.  Symptoms included muscle aches, pain, weakness, fever, dark urine, and decreased urine output.  Acute renal failure could result from rhabdomyolysis. Other serious side effects included myopathy and myositis (muscle inflammation).



## **Contraindications**

Cerivastatin was contraindicated in patients with:

- Active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations in liver enzymes
- Hypersensitivity to the drug
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding


## **Drug Interactions**


Cerivastatin had interactions with multiple drugs.  Co-administration with gemfibrozil, other fibrates, cyclosporine, erythromycin, azole antifungals (itraconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole), or niacin increased the risk of rhabdomyolysis. Other interactions included increased cerivastatin levels with itraconazole and cholestyramine reducing cerivastatin bioavailability.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**


Cerivastatin was classified as Pregnancy Category X and was contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of fetal harm, including skeletal malformations. It was also contraindicated during breastfeeding because it was excreted into human milk and posed a risk of serious adverse reactions in nursing infants.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

Cerivastatin is no longer available on the market due to an increased risk of severe side effects, specifically rhabdomyolysis.



## **Popular Combinations**

Cerivastatin is no longer available on the market and hence not used in any combinations.


## **Precautions**

Cerivastatin is no longer available on the market.
