## **Usage**

Cetalkonium Chloride is primarily prescribed for the relief of pain, discomfort, and inflammation associated with mouth ulcers, cold sores, denture irritations, and minor mouth infections. It also aids in the healing process.  Its pharmacological classifications include antiseptic and topical analgesic. Its mechanism of action involves disrupting bacterial cell membranes, inactivating bacterial enzymes, and denaturing proteins, leading to bacterial cell death. It also provides local pain relief.

## **Alternate Names**

- Benzylhexadecyldimethylammonium chloride
- C16 alkyl benzalkonium chloride

**Brand Names:**

- Bonjela
- Bonjela Junior Gel (contains lidocaine and cetylpyridinium chloride, not cetalkonium chloride)
- Oral Aid Gel
- Avera Gel
- Drujela
- Kin Care Oral Mucosal Gel
- Fote Avera Gel


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cetalkonium Chloride exerts its antiseptic action by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane, inactivating bacterial enzymes, and denaturing bacterial proteins.  This leads to bacterial cell death.  It's also a weak local anesthetic providing pain relief.

**Pharmacokinetics:** When used topically in the mouth, absorption is minimal. As such, information on metabolism and elimination pathways is not typically relevant in clinical practice for topical oral formulations.  However, if absorbed in meaningful quantities, hepatic metabolism and renal excretion would be anticipated.

**Mode of Action:** Cetalkonium Chloride is a cationic surfactant.  Its positive charge interacts with the negatively charged bacterial cell membranes, leading to membrane disruption and increased permeability. This disruption allows the drug to enter the bacterial cell, where it inactivates essential enzymes and denatures proteins, ultimately causing cell death.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a half-inch ribbon of gel to the affected area every three hours, as needed. Do not exceed six doses in a 24-hour period.

#### **Children (over 4 months old in some formulations):**

Apply approximately half the adult dose to the affected area every three hours, as needed.  Do not exceed six doses in a 24-hour period. Some formulations are not approved for use in children under four months of age. Teething gels containing cetalkonium chloride are specifically contraindicated in teething infants.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  No dose adjustment is typically necessary.
- **Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment:** As absorption is minimal with topical oral use, no dose adjustments are usually required.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage remains consistent across different clinical situations involving localized oral lesions or minor infections.  Always follow standard dosage recommendations.  Formulations including cetalkonium chloride are not indicated for clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
- Temporary burning sensation at the application site (especially on broken skin).
- Allergic reactions (rare).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
- Severe allergic reactions (seek immediate medical help).



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to cetalkonium chloride or any other components in the formulation.
- Active peptic ulcer.
-  Use in children under 4 months in some formulations.
- Children and adolescents under the age of 16 in some formulations.

## **Drug Interactions**
As absorption is minimal with topical use, clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely.  However, theoretical interactions with other topically applied oral medications are possible. Concomitant use of salicylates systemically may require dosage adjustments.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Use with caution.  Although topical absorption is limited, safety in pregnancy has not been definitively established. Some salicylate containing formulations are not recommended during the first and second trimesters.
- **Breastfeeding:** Small amounts may be excreted in breast milk, but significant adverse effects on the infant are unlikely.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Disrupts bacterial cell membranes, inactivates bacterial enzymes and proteins, causing cell death. Weak local anesthetic.
- **Side Effects:** Burning sensation at the application site, rare allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, active peptic ulcer, specific age restrictions for some formulations.
- **Drug Interactions:** Unlikely with topical oral use, but consider systemic salicylate use.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution during pregnancy.  Generally considered safe for short-term use during breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** Apply a half-inch ribbon (adults) or half that amount (children over 4 months - check specific formulation guidelines) to the affected area every three hours, not exceeding six doses in 24 hours.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Observe for local irritation or signs of allergic reactions.



## **Precautions**
Cetalkonium chloride is only for topical application in the oral cavity. Do not swallow the gel. Do not use on large areas or broken skin except under medical supervision.
