  - q: >-
      Does cetirizine cause drowsiness?**


      **A:** Although a second-generation antihistamine, cetirizine can cause
      some drowsiness in certain individuals.  It is generally less sedating
      than first-generation antihistamines. Advise patients about potential
      drowsiness and recommend caution when driving or operating machinery.

      What should patients do if they miss a dose of cetirizine?**


      **A:** Take the missed dose as soon as they remember. However, if it is
      almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue with
      their regular dosing schedule. Do not double the dose.

## **Usage**

Cetirizine is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of allergic conditions such as:

* **Seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever):**  Nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, itchy nose and throat, and watery eyes caused by pollen, mold, and other allergens.
* **Perennial allergic rhinitis:** Similar symptoms to hay fever, but occurring year-round due to allergens like dust mites, pet dander, and cockroaches.
* **Chronic idiopathic urticaria (hives):**  Itchy, raised welts on the skin.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Cetirizine is a second-generation antihistamine.

**Mechanism of Action:** Cetirizine competitively inhibits the binding of histamine to H1 receptors. This action reduces the vascular permeability and formation of edema associated with allergic reactions. It also decreases the release of other mediators of inflammation.

## **Alternate Names**

* Cetirizine hydrochloride (the salt form)
* Several generic formulations are available.

**Brand Names:**

* Zyrtec
* Aller-Tec
* Alleroff
* Quzyttir
* Reactine (Canada)
* Benadryl Allergy (some formulations)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cetirizine primarily acts by blocking the effects of histamine at H1 receptors, reducing the symptoms of allergic reactions. It is considered a non-sedating antihistamine as it poorly penetrates the blood-brain barrier.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Well-absorbed orally, with peak plasma concentrations reached in approximately 1 hour. Food does not significantly affect absorption but might slightly delay peak concentrations.
* **Metabolism:** Minimally metabolized in the liver.
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine, with a half-life of about 8-11 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Cetirizine competitively binds to peripheral H1 receptors, preventing histamine from binding and triggering the cascade of events that lead to allergic symptoms.

**Receptor Binding:**  Selective for H1 receptors, with minimal affinity for other receptors.

**Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** No significant enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation effects.

**Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* 10 mg orally once daily.  A 5 mg dose may be sufficient for milder symptoms.  The maximum dose is 10 mg per 24 hours.

#### **Children:**

* **6-11 years:** 5 mg twice daily, or 10mg once daily.
* **2-5 years:** 2.5 mg once daily, which may be increased to a maximum of 5 mg per day (either as a single dose or divided into two 2.5 mg doses 12 hours apart).
* **6 months - 23 months:** 2.5 mg once daily. 
* **Under 6 months:** Use is not recommended unless under direct medical supervision.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** A starting dose of 5 mg once daily is often recommended due to potential age-related decrease in renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is necessary based on the degree of impairment.  For moderate renal impairment, 5 mg once daily is usually recommended.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dose adjustments are generally not required unless there is concomitant renal impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dose adjustments might be necessary on a case-by-case basis.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Cetirizine is not typically administered in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU. It is not indicated for emergency situations. However, it can be administered intravenously to treat acute urticaria in children and adults.
* **Intravenous administration**
* **Children 6 months to 5 years:** 2.5mg every 24 hours as needed
* **Children 6-11 years:** 5-10 mg every 24 hours depending on severity
* **12 years and older:** 10mg every 24 hours


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are required for patients with renal impairment.  Consult specific guidelines for creatinine clearance-based dose recommendations.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

* Somnolence (drowsiness)
* Fatigue
* Dry mouth
* Headache


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Angioedema (severe swelling)
* Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
* Severe skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome)


### **Long-Term Effects:**

No significant long-term effects have been reported.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis, angioedema) should be treated as a medical emergency.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to cetirizine or hydroxyzine.
* Severe renal impairment (end-stage renal disease).



## **Drug Interactions**

* **CNS Depressants:** Alcohol or other drugs with sedative properties can enhance the sedative effects of cetirizine.
* **Theophylline:** May decrease the clearance of cetirizine.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Category B. While generally considered safe, use only if clearly needed.
* **Breastfeeding:** Cetirizine is excreted in breast milk. Use with caution in breastfeeding mothers.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Competitive H1 receptor antagonist.
* **Side Effects:** Somnolence, fatigue, dry mouth, headache. Rarely, angioedema, anaphylaxis.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe renal impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** CNS depressants, theophylline.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category B; use with caution if breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 10 mg/day; Children:  refer to pediatric dosage charts.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** No specific routine monitoring required.  Monitor for adverse effects.


## **Popular Combinations**

Cetirizine is sometimes combined with pseudoephedrine (a decongestant) for the relief of combined nasal congestion and allergy symptoms.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may require dosage adjustments.
* **Specific Populations:** Elderly patients should start at a lower dose. Use with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants that may exacerbate drowsiness. Caution with activities requiring alertness (e.g., driving).
