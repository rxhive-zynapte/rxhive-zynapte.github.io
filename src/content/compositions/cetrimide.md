## **Usage**

Cetrimide is a topical antiseptic and disinfectant. It's used to cleanse and disinfect minor wounds, burns, cuts, abrasions, and skin infections. It can also be used to treat dry and chapped skin, nappy rash, and some skin disorders like seborrheic dermatitis.  Its pharmacological classification is antiseptic and disinfectant.

Cetrimide works by disrupting the cell membranes of bacteria and other microorganisms, causing them to leak their essential components and die. This action helps prevent or control infection in affected areas.

## **Alternate Names**

- Cetrimonium Bromide
- Tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide
- Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide

Brand names vary depending on the region and formulation.  Some examples include Cetavlon, Savlon, and Cetrim.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cetrimide is a quaternary ammonium cationic surfactant with bactericidal activity primarily against gram-positive bacteria and some gram-negative bacteria at higher concentrations. It has limited effectiveness against viruses and fungi.  Cetrimide acts by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane, leading to cell death.  It is not effective against bacterial spores.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Cetrimide is primarily used topically, meaning it is applied directly to the skin.  Absorption through intact skin is minimal, thus systemic effects are unlikely.  Information on metabolism and elimination is limited due to low systemic absorption. It is typically not metabolized by CYP enzymes.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Apply a thin layer of 0.5% to 1% cream or lotion to the affected area 2-3 times daily.  0.5% solutions can be sprayed onto the affected area.

#### **Children:**  Can generally use the same dosage as adults, but always consult a doctor before use in infants or young children, especially those with extensive skin conditions.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required due to low systemic absorption.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required due to low systemic absorption.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider the specific condition and consult a doctor for tailored advice.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Cetrimide is not typically recommended for use in specialized clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or within the ICU, except for localized skin cleansing or wound care as directed by a physician. It is not used in emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are not usually necessary.  However, always exercise caution when applying to large areas of broken or damaged skin, especially in infants or young children, due to the potential for increased absorption.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
- Skin irritation
- Redness
- Itching
- Burning sensation

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling)
- Difficulty breathing

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Hypersensitivity with prolonged use

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) requiring immediate medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

- Known hypersensitivity to cetrimide.
- Application to eyes, ears, or other sensitive mucous membranes.
- Use inside body cavities.
- Deep or puncture wounds.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Avoid using with anionic surfactants (like soaps) as they can inactivate cetrimide.  
- May enhance bactericidal activity when combined with alcohol-containing preparations.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established.  Although systemic absorption is minimal, use with caution and consult a physician if necessary.  Avoid applying to the nipples before breastfeeding. Consider rinsing the area thoroughly after use.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Disrupts bacterial cell membranes.
- **Side Effects:** Skin irritation, redness, itching, burning sensation, allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to cetrimide.
- **Drug Interactions:** Anionic surfactants.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution and consult a doctor.
- **Dosage:** Topical application 2-3 times daily, 0.5%-1% cream/lotion/solution.

## **Popular Combinations**

Cetrimide is sometimes combined with chlorhexidine, another antiseptic, for broader antimicrobial coverage.

## **Precautions**

- Avoid contact with eyes, ears, and mucous membranes.
- For external use only.
- Discontinue use if irritation or sensitization occurs.
