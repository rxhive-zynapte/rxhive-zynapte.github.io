## **Usage**

Cetuximab is prescribed for the treatment of:

* **EGFR-expressing, RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC):**
    * In combination with irinotecan-based chemotherapy.
    * As first-line treatment in combination with FOLFOX.
    * As a single agent in patients who have failed oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based therapy and are intolerant to irinotecan.
* **Squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN):**
    * In combination with radiation therapy for locally advanced disease.
    * In combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for recurrent and/or metastatic disease.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Monoclonal antibody; Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitor.

**Mechanism of Action:** Cetuximab is a chimeric (mouse/human) IgG1 monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the EGFR. It competitively inhibits the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and other ligands to EGFR. This binding prevents EGFR activation, leading to inhibition of cell growth and proliferation, induction of apoptosis (programmed cell death), and decreased production of pro-angiogenic factors.


## **Alternate Names**

**International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Cetuximab

**Brand Name:** Erbitux


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cetuximab binds to EGFR on tumor cells, preventing ligand binding and receptor activation. This leads to inhibition of downstream signaling pathways involved in cell growth, proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Administered intravenously.
* **Distribution:** Distributes primarily within the vascular compartment. Volume of distribution is approximately equivalent to the vascular space (2.9 L/m²).
* **Metabolism:** Primarily through internalization and degradation of the EGFR complex, mainly by hepatocytes and skin.
* **Elimination:**  Nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Elimination pathways become saturated at doses between 200-500 mg/m².  Clearance is approximately 20 mL/h/m². Terminal half-life is approximately 112 hours (range 63-230 hours).


**Mode of Action:** Cetuximab competitively binds to the extracellular domain of EGFR, preventing ligand-induced receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation.  This blocks the activation of downstream signaling cascades, including the RAS/RAF/MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways, crucial for cell growth, proliferation, and survival.


**Receptor Binding:** Binds specifically and with high affinity to EGFR (HER1).

**Enzyme Inhibition:** Indirectly inhibits downstream kinases involved in EGFR signaling.


**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily via internalization and degradation of the drug-receptor complex; some hepatic metabolism. It is not significantly excreted renally.


## **Dosage**

Cetuximab is administered intravenously. Premedication with an antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydramine) and a corticosteroid is recommended at least 1 hour prior to the first and all subsequent infusions to reduce the risk of infusion reactions.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Weekly Regimen:**
    * Initial dose: 400 mg/m² IV over 120 minutes.
    * Subsequent doses: 250 mg/m² IV over 60 minutes once weekly.
* **Bi-weekly Regimen:** 500 mg/m² IV over 120 minutes every two weeks.

#### **Children:**  Safety and efficacy not established in children under 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is required, but caution is advised due to the potential for increased toxicity, especially in patients with cardiac history.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment required. 
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with pre-existing lung disease or cardiovascular disease.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Cetuximab's dosing in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy follows the standard dosage regimens described above, adjusted as needed based on concomitant treatments and patient tolerance.

* **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use/Emergency Situations:** There are no specific dosage recommendations for these scenarios outside the established regimens for mCRC and SCCHN.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

* **Infusion Reactions:** For mild to moderate infusion reactions, the infusion rate may be slowed or temporarily interrupted.  Severe reactions require permanent discontinuation.
* **Dermatologic Toxicity:** Dose reductions or delays may be necessary for severe skin reactions.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Acne-like rash
* Itching, dry skin
* Nail changes
* Mucositis (inflammation of the mucous membranes)
* Fatigue
* Diarrhea/constipation
* Nausea/vomiting
* Headache
* Electrolyte imbalances (hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia)


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Severe infusion reactions (anaphylaxis, dyspnea, hypotension)
* Interstitial lung disease
* Cardiopulmonary arrest
* Sudden death


### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term effects are primarily related to the cumulative toxicity of cetuximab and concomitant treatments.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs include severe hypersensitivity reactions, interstitial lung disease, and cardiopulmonary events.


## **Contraindications**

* Known severe hypersensitivity to cetuximab.
* mCRC with RAS mutations or unknown RAS status (for use in combination with oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy).


## **Drug Interactions**

Formal drug interaction studies are limited. Potential interactions may occur with concomitant chemotherapy or radiotherapy, increasing the risk of myelosuppression, cardiac ischemia, and hand-foot syndrome. Close monitoring is required when cetuximab is used in combination with other therapies.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy Safety Category:**  D

**Fetal Risks:** Cetuximab can cross the placenta. EGFR plays a crucial role in fetal development. Animal studies showed an increased risk of abortion.  Cetuximab should be avoided during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus.

**Breastfeeding:**  Cetuximab is likely excreted in breast milk.  Breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment and for 2 months after the last dose.
