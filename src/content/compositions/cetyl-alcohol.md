## **Usage**

Cetyl alcohol is primarily used as an emollient, emulsifier, thickening agent, and stabilizer in various topical pharmaceutical formulations and cosmetic products like creams, lotions, ointments, shampoos, and conditioners.  It is not a medication in the traditional sense and therefore does not have a pharmacological classification in the same way that drugs do.  Its mechanism of action involves creating a protective barrier on the skin's surface, preventing water loss and thus moisturizing and softening the skin. It also helps to combine oil and water in formulations, and thickens creams and lotions.

## **Alternate Names**

- Hexadecan-1-ol
- Palmityl alcohol
- Cetostearyl alcohol (when mixed with stearyl alcohol)
- (C16-C18) ALKYL ALCOHOL
- 1-OCTADECANOL, MIXT. WITH 1-HEXADECANOL
- ALCOHOLS, C16-18
- ALCOHOLS, C1618
- CETEARYL ALCOHOL
- CETOSTEARYL ALCOHOL
- CETYL/STEARYL ALCOHOL, MIXT. WITH 1-HEXADECANOL 1-OCTADECANOL
- UNIOX A

It's sold under various brand names, often as an ingredient in cosmetic products rather than a standalone medication.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cetyl alcohol acts topically by forming a protective layer on the skin, reducing transepidermal water loss and enhancing skin hydration. It also softens the skin and improves its texture.  In cosmetic products, it serves as an emollient, thickener, and emulsifier.

**Pharmacokinetics:** As cetyl alcohol is primarily used topically, its systemic absorption is minimal. Limited data exists on its metabolism and elimination. Some sources suggest potential metabolism to palmitic acid and excretion through urine and feces, but more research is needed.


## **Dosage**

Cetyl alcohol is not a drug with specific dosing guidelines. Its concentration in formulations varies depending on the intended use and product.

### **Standard Dosage**  

As an ingredient rather than a medicine, cetyl alcohol doesn't have standard dosages in the same way medicines do.  Typical concentrations in cosmetic products range from 0.5% to 20%, but it can be higher (up to 40%).  A 3% concentration is often used in lotions and creams.  

#### **Adults:**

See above

#### **Children:**

See above

#### **Special Cases:** 

It's recommended that patients with eczema and other skin conditions, as well as those with known sensitivities, use products containing cetyl alcohol with caution and perform a patch test before widespread use. The same is true for pregnant and breastfeeding women.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Cetyl alcohol is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU in the same way that drugs are used.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Not applicable.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
Generally, cetyl alcohol is well-tolerated.  Some individuals, particularly those with sensitive skin or specific allergies, might experience mild and temporary skin irritation, redness, itching, or a burning sensation.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Allergic contact dermatitis is a rare but potential adverse effect.

### **Long-Term Effects**
No long-term adverse effects from topical use of cetyl alcohol are known.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
No ADRs requiring immediate intervention have been reported with cetyl alcohol.

## **Contraindications**

Known hypersensitivity to cetyl alcohol is a contraindication.

## **Drug Interactions**

Limited information is available.  Some suggest potential interaction with retinoids, exfoliating acids, or other potentially irritating topical ingredients.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Limited data suggest no known risk for cetyl alcohol use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. However, due to limited systematic evaluation, it's recommended to exercise caution and consult a physician before using products containing cetyl alcohol during these periods.
