## **Usage**

Chlorhexidine Gluconate is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of oral infections like gingivitis, as well as for preoperative skin disinfection and reducing the risk of surgical site infections. Its pharmacological classifications include antiseptic, disinfectant, and antimicrobial.  The mechanism of action involves disrupting the bacterial cell membrane, causing leakage of intracellular components and ultimately cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

Chlorhexidine digluconate. Brand names include Peridex, PerioGard, and Hibiclens.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Chlorhexidine Gluconate exerts a bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect by disrupting bacterial cell membranes. This leads to the leakage of intracellular contents and eventual cell death. It is effective against a broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, some fungi, and viruses.

**Pharmacokinetics:** 
* **Absorption:**  Negligible absorption occurs following topical oral use. Systemic absorption is minimal with intact skin, but may be increased with damaged skin or mucous membranes.
* **Metabolism:**  Limited information is available on the metabolism of Chlorhexidine Gluconate.
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted unchanged in feces.  A small amount may be excreted in urine.

**Mode of Action:**  Chlorhexidine binds to negatively charged bacterial cell walls, disrupting the membrane integrity and causing leakage of intracellular components. At low concentrations, it has a bacteriostatic effect, while higher concentrations exert a bactericidal action.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Not applicable for Chlorhexidine Gluconate.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily eliminated through fecal excretion, with a small portion excreted unchanged in urine.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral Rinse:** 15 mL (1 tablespoon) of 0.12% solution, rinsed for 30 seconds twice daily (morning and evening after toothbrushing). Do not swallow.
* **Skin Disinfection:** As directed, depending on the concentration and formulation.

#### **Children:**

Pediatric dosing for oral rinse must be determined by a dentist or medical doctor. For other topical use, follow medical advice.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required but monitor for potential side effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are needed as systemic absorption is minimal.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are generally required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with severe open wounds or burns due to potential for increased systemic absorption.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Intubation:**  0.12% oral rinse may be used as part of an oral care protocol to reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
* **Surgical Procedures:** Preoperative skin preparation with 2% or 4% solutions. Wound irrigation with 0.05% solution.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** 0.12% oral rinse twice daily as part of a VAP prevention bundle.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Daily bathing with 2% solution to prevent hospital-acquired infections.
* **Emergency Situations:**  Not indicated for specific emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are not typically necessary based on renal or hepatic function due to minimal systemic absorption. Adjust based on the patient's tolerance and clinical response.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Altered taste
* Tooth staining (temporary and superficial, primarily with long-term use)
* Mouth/tongue irritation
* Dry mouth

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Severe allergic reactions (e.g., hives, breathing difficulties, swelling of face, lips, or tongue)
* Superinfection (overgrowth of resistant organisms)

### **Long-Term Effects**

Tooth staining (with prolonged use) and potential for changes in oral flora.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Serious allergic reactions.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to chlorhexidine.

## **Drug Interactions**

Limited information is available on clinically significant drug interactions. However, avoid concurrent use with other oral hygiene products (e.g., toothpaste, mouthwash) as they can reduce its effectiveness.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Topical chlorhexidine is considered generally safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Use as directed by a healthcare professional.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Disrupts bacterial cell membranes.
* **Side Effects:** Altered taste, tooth staining, mouth irritation, dry mouth.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:** Limited data. Avoid concurrent use with other oral hygiene products.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe for topical use.
* **Dosage:** See above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor oral hygiene, taste changes, and signs of hypersensitivity.


## **Popular Combinations**

Often used in combination with mechanical toothbrushing for optimal oral hygiene.

## **Precautions**

* Avoid contact with eyes and ears.
* Not for ingestion.
