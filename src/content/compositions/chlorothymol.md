## **Usage**

Chlorothymol is primarily used as a topical antiseptic and decongestant, often in combination with other medications like camphor, menthol, and eucalyptol. It is commonly found in inhalant capsules or solutions used to relieve symptoms of the common cold, flu, sinusitis, pharyngitis, and other respiratory ailments characterized by nasal and sinus congestion.  It can also be found in mouthwashes and other oral hygiene products to treat oral and throat infections and gingivitis.

Its pharmacological classifications include:

* **Antiseptic:** Chlorothymol inhibits the growth of microorganisms.
* **Decongestant:** It shrinks swollen mucous membranes in the nasal passages.
* **Antitussive:** It contributes to cough suppression.
* **Expectorant:** It can help loosen mucus and phlegm.
* **Antimalarial:** Studies suggest potential antimalarial properties, though not currently used clinically for this purpose.
* **Anticonvulsant:**  Chlorothymol is an effective anticonvulsant in several mouse seizure assays.

**Mechanism of Action:**  Chlorothymol's antiseptic action stems from its ability to disrupt bacterial cell walls and inhibit microbial growth. Its decongestant properties arise from its vasoconstrictive effects on nasal mucosa.  As an anticonvulsant, it acts as a potent GABAA receptor subunit LGC-37 positive modulator.



## **Alternate Names**

* Chlorthymol
* 4-Chlorothymol

**Brand names:**  It is often included in combination products such as Karvol Plus, Sinarest Vapocaps, Breathlee, KOLQ Inhalant Capsules, and others.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Chlorothymol exerts antiseptic, decongestant, antitussive, expectorant and anticonvulsant effects. Topically it acts as a rubefacient (causes redness of the skin) and mild analgesic.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily administered via inhalation or topical application. Absorption, metabolism, and elimination data are limited. For oral administration, absorption is expected through the gastrointestinal tract. Metabolism likely occurs in the liver, with elimination through renal or hepatic routes.  The exact pathways and half-life are not well-defined in available resources.

**Mode of Action:**  Chlorothymol's antiseptic effect involves disrupting microbial cell walls and inhibiting their growth.  Its decongestant effect is due to vasoconstriction of nasal mucosa. As an anticonvulsant, it acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**  Binds to the LGC-37 subunit of the GABAA receptor as a positive allosteric modulator.  Specific enzyme interactions are not well-documented.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Elimination pathways are not explicitly detailed in the provided information. Hepatic metabolism and renal/hepatic excretion are likely involved.


## **Dosage**

Chlorothymol is typically administered by inhalation, commonly found in combination products. Dosage varies depending on the product.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The contents of one inhalant capsule (typically containing 5mg of chlorothymol alongside other ingredients) are usually inhaled up to three times daily. The capsule contents are squeezed into hot (not boiling) water or onto a tissue or handkerchief, and the vapors are inhaled deeply.  Alternatively, the capsule contents can be placed on a pillow or nightdress for nighttime relief. Oral formulations like mouthwashes typically contain 0.1-0.2% chlorothymol.

#### **Children:**

Due to limited safety data, inhalant products are generally not recommended for children under six years of age. For children six years and older, the adult dose may be used, but consultation with a physician is crucial. Use caution in children under 6 years of age for oral formulations.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments are not typically required.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Specific guidelines are not available; caution is advised.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Specific guidelines are not available; caution is advised.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized assessment is needed; consult a physician.

### **Clinical Use Cases:**

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not provided in the source material.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Data on dosage adjustments based on renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms are limited.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Nasal irritation
* Throat irritation
* Burning sensation
* Watery eyes
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
