## **Usage**

Chlorpromazine is prescribed for a range of conditions, including:

*   **Psychotic disorders:** Schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder.
*   **Nausea and vomiting:**  Including that associated with surgery, chemotherapy, and gastroenteritis.
*   **Intractable hiccups:** Persistent hiccups unresponsive to other treatments.
*   **Preoperative apprehension and anxiety:** To promote relaxation before surgical procedures.
*   **Behavioral disorders and hyperactivity in children:** Especially in hospitalized settings.
*   **Acute intermittent porphyria:** A rare metabolic disorder.
*   **Tetanus:** As an adjunct to other treatments.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Chlorpromazine is classified as a first-generation (typical) antipsychotic, also known as a neuroleptic. It belongs to the phenothiazine class of medications.

**Mechanism of Action:** Chlorpromazine primarily acts as a dopamine receptor antagonist, specifically blocking D2 receptors in the brain. This action is believed to be responsible for its antipsychotic effects. It also has anticholinergic, antihistaminic, and alpha-adrenergic blocking properties, contributing to its sedative and other effects.



## **Alternate Names**

*   Chlorpromazine hydrochloride
*   Largactil (brand name)
*   Thorazine (brand name)
*   Thoradol (brand name)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Chlorpromazine's primary effect is the blockade of dopamine D2 receptors in various brain regions. This blockade impacts dopaminergic pathways, leading to a reduction in psychotic symptoms. Its anticholinergic, antihistaminic, and alpha-adrenergic blocking actions contribute to sedative, antiemetic, and hypotensive effects, respectively.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:**  Well-absorbed orally, but bioavailability is reduced by first-pass metabolism. Intramuscular (IM) and intravenous (IV) routes provide higher bioavailability.
*   **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6. Numerous metabolites are formed, some of which are active.
*   **Elimination:** Excreted in urine and bile, with a half-life of approximately 30 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Chlorpromazine binds to and blocks dopamine D2 receptors, preventing dopamine from binding and exerting its effects. This receptor blockade disrupts dopaminergic neurotransmission, which is thought to be overactive in psychotic disorders. It also influences other neurotransmitter systems, including acetylcholine, histamine, and norepinephrine, through receptor blockade.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily hepatic metabolism followed by renal and biliary excretion. CYP2D6 is the major enzyme involved in its metabolism.



## **Dosage**

The dosage of chlorpromazine varies depending on the indication, patient age, and other factors. It's important to note that the information below is for general guidance and should be tailored to individual patients.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   **Oral:** Initially 30-75 mg per day divided every 6-12 hours, gradually increasing to a maintenance dose of 200 mg per day. Higher doses (up to 800 mg or more) may be required in some cases.
*   **IM/IV:** Initially 25 mg, followed by 25-50 mg every 1-4 hours as needed, up to a maximum of 400 mg every 4-6 hours. Usual dosage is 300-800 mg per day.

#### **Children:**

*   **Under 6 months:** Safety and efficacy not established.
*   **6 months and older:** Dosage based on weight (0.5-1 mg/kg) or age. Dosing frequency is typically every 4-6 hours. Maximum daily doses are usually limited (40 mg for 1-5 years, 75 mg for 6-12 years).

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Lower initial doses are recommended (typically 1/3 to 1/2 the adult dose), with gradual titration based on response and tolerability.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be needed based on renal function.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction is usually required due to impaired metabolism.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary, particularly for patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or other conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing for specific clinical situations varies and should be guided by clinical protocols and patient response:

*   **Intubation:**  Chlorpromazine is not typically used for intubation itself but may be used to manage agitation or nausea/vomiting associated with the procedure.
*   **Surgical Procedures:** May be used preoperatively for anxiety and postoperatively for nausea and vomiting.
*   **Mechanical Ventilation:**  Not routinely indicated but may be used to manage agitation or delirium.
*   **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** May be used to manage delirium or agitation.
*   **Emergency Situations:**  IM or IV administration may be used to rapidly control severe agitation or psychotic symptoms.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on individual patient factors, including renal and hepatic function, other medical conditions, concomitant medications, and response to therapy. Therapeutic drug monitoring may be helpful in some cases.
