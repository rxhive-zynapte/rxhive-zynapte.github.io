## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Chlorthalidone is primarily prescribed for the management of hypertension (high blood pressure). It's also used to treat edema (fluid retention) associated with heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and renal disease, including nephrotic syndrome.  It can also be used to prevent recurrent calcium oxalate calculi in individuals with normocalcaemic hypercalciuria.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Thiazide-like diuretic.  Although its chemical structure differs slightly, its effects are similar to thiazide diuretics.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Chlorthalidone inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron. This leads to increased excretion of sodium, chloride, and water, thereby reducing blood volume and lowering blood pressure. It also has a vasodilatory effect, further contributing to blood pressure reduction.

## **Alternate Names**

-  No widely recognized alternate names for chlorthalidone itself.
- **Brand Names:** Hygroton, Thalitone.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Chlorthalidone's primary effect is to reduce blood volume through diuresis. It also has a secondary vasodilatory effect, which further lowers blood pressure.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
    - **Metabolism:** Limited hepatic metabolism.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.  The elimination half-life is long, typically around 40-60 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Chlorthalidone inhibits the sodium-chloride cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule, increasing sodium and chloride excretion.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Primarily acts by inhibiting the sodium-chloride cotransporter.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Hypertension:** Initial dose is 12.5-25 mg orally once daily, preferably in the morning with food.  If the response is insufficient, the dose may be increased to 50 mg daily.  Doses above 100 mg are not recommended.
- **Edema:** Initial dose is 50-100 mg orally once daily or 100 mg every other day. The dose may be increased up to 200 mg per day if needed.

#### **Children:**

- **Hypertension (Off-label):** Initial dose is 0.3 mg/kg/day orally. It may be increased to up to 2 mg/kg/day, not to exceed 50 mg/day. Dosage adjustments should be based on individual response and should be made at intervals of 2-4 weeks.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose (e.g., 12.5 mg daily) and titrate cautiously due to the risk of electrolyte imbalances and orthostatic hypotension. Close monitoring of electrolytes is essential.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically necessary in mild to moderate renal impairment.  In severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min), the drug is generally less effective and caution is advised.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment, as chlorthalidone may precipitate hepatic coma, particularly in severe hepatic dysfunction. 
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised in patients with diabetes mellitus, gout, hypercholesterolemia, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Chlorthalidone is not typically used in situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary indications are hypertension and edema.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are generally based on the patient's blood pressure response, renal function, and potential for electrolyte imbalances.  Monitoring electrolytes (especially potassium, sodium, and magnesium) is particularly important, especially in elderly patients and those with renal impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, constipation, impotence, and photosensitivity.  Electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia, hyperuricemia, and hypochloremic alkalosis) can also occur.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe hypotension, syncope, pancreatitis, jaundice, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and allergic reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Electrolyte disturbances (especially hypokalemia), gout, and hyperglycemia.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe hypotension, syncope,  severe electrolyte imbalances, and hypersensitivity reactions (including angioedema and anaphylaxis).



## **Contraindications**

- Anuria (absence of urine formation).
- Hypersensitivity to chlorthalidone or other sulfonamide-derived medications.
- Severe renal failure (CrCl < 30 mL/min).
- Severe hepatic impairment.


## **Drug Interactions**

- **Antihypertensive drugs:** Additive hypotensive effect.
- **Lithium:** Increased risk of lithium toxicity due to reduced renal clearance.
- **Digoxin:** Increased risk of digoxin toxicity due to electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia).
- **NSAIDs:** Reduced antihypertensive effect of chlorthalidone and increased risk of renal impairment.
- **Corticosteroids:** Increased risk of hypokalemia.
- **Diabetes medications:**  May reduce glucose tolerance and necessitate adjustment of diabetes medications.
- **CYP450 interactions:** No clinically significant CYP450 interactions.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  C. Not recommended unless potential benefits clearly outweigh risks. Potential for fetal/neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and electrolyte disturbances.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Chlorthalidone is excreted in breast milk and not recommended during breastfeeding. Consider discontinuing breastfeeding or the drug, weighing the importance of the drug to the mother.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule, leading to increased excretion of sodium, chloride, and water, resulting in diuresis and vasodilation.
- **Side Effects:** Dizziness, lightheadedness, electrolyte imbalances, gastrointestinal upset. Rarely, severe hypotension, blood dyscrasias, severe skin reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Anuria, hypersensitivity to sulfonamides, severe renal/hepatic impairment.
- **Drug Interactions:** Other antihypertensives, lithium, digoxin, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, diabetes medications.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Not recommended.
- **Dosage:** Hypertension: 12.5-50 mg/day; Edema: 50-200 mg/day. Adjust for elderly and renal impairment.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, electrolytes (potassium, sodium, magnesium), renal function, blood glucose.


## **Popular Combinations**

Often combined with other antihypertensive agents, such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, or calcium channel blockers, to achieve better blood pressure control.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Monitor electrolytes, renal function, and blood glucose regularly.  Assess for dehydration and orthostatic hypotension.
- **Specific Populations:**  Use with caution in elderly patients, patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and those with diabetes, gout, or SLE.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Advise patients to avoid excessive sun exposure and to stay hydrated, especially during hot weather or exercise.
