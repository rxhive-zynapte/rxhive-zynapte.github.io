## **Usage**

- Choline salicylate is prescribed for the relief of pain and inflammation associated with mouth ulcers, cold sores, denture sore spots, infant teething, and orthodontic appliance irritation.  It also provides relief from the pain and discomfort of minor mouth and throat infections.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), Analgesic, Anti-inflammatory, Antipyretic.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Choline salicylate works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing the production of prostaglandins, which are responsible for pain and inflammation.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:** Choline magnesium trisalicylate (when combined with magnesium salicylate)
- **Brand Names:** Bonjela, Teejel

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Choline salicylate exerts its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. The choline component may facilitate the penetration of salicylate into the oral mucosa.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Rapidly absorbed through the oral mucosa.
    - **Metabolism:** Metabolized to salicylic acid.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion of salicylic acid and its metabolites.
- **Mode of Action:** Inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, decreasing prostaglandin production.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**  COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme inhibition.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Gel:** Apply a small amount (about 1 cm strip) to the affected area every three hours as needed.
- **Lozenges:** Allow one lozenge to dissolve slowly in the mouth every two to three hours as needed.

#### **Children:**

- **Gel (over 4 months):** Apply a pea-sized amount (about 0.5 cm strip) to the affected area up to every three hours, not exceeding six times in 24 hours.
- **Children under 4 months:** Use only as directed by a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required, but start with the lowest effective dose and monitor for adverse effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dose adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dose adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with asthma, peptic ulcer disease, or bleeding disorders.
