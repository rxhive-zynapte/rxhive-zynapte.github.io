## **Usage**

- Chromium picolinate is primarily used as a dietary supplement for improving insulin sensitivity and managing blood sugar levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. It's also promoted for weight loss, lowering cholesterol, and improving athletic performance, although evidence supporting these uses is limited.
- **Pharmacological classification**:  Nutritional supplement, trace mineral.
- **Mechanism of action**: Chromium is an essential trace element that plays a vital role in potentiating insulin action and glucose metabolism.  While the exact mechanism is not fully understood, it's thought that chromium enhances insulin receptor binding or activity, thus improving glucose uptake into cells.

## **Alternate Names**

- Trivalent chromium, chromium(III) picolinate
- Brand names: Numerous brand names exist for chromium picolinate supplements.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Chromium improves insulin sensitivity, leading to better blood glucose control. The effects are most pronounced in individuals with pre-existing insulin resistance or chromium deficiency.
- **Pharmacokinetics**: Chromium picolinate is absorbed relatively poorly in the gastrointestinal tract, with estimates ranging from 0.4% to 2.5%.  Absorption is enhanced by vitamin C and niacin. It's distributed throughout the body, with higher concentrations found in the liver, kidneys, spleen, and bone. Elimination occurs primarily through the kidneys.
- **Mode of action**: Chromium's precise mode of action isn't fully elucidated.  It is believed to interact with an oligopeptide known as chromodulin, which potentially enhances insulin signaling.  It is also hypothesized that chromium acts through its association with apochromodulin or other chromodulin-like molecules, thereby exerting regulatory influence on protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) activity. 
- **Receptor binding/enzyme inhibition**:  Chromium's interaction with chromodulin or other chromodulin-like molecules is involved in modulating the tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor. It is also thought to potentially inhibit PTP1B activity, although this is not fully understood.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Adequate intake (AI) for adults (19-50 years): 35 mcg/day for males, 25 mcg/day for females. 
- For managing blood sugar:  200-1000 mcg/day, divided into multiple doses.  Dosages up to 1000 mcg/day for up to 6 months and 200-1000 mcg/day for up to 2 years have been used safely in some studies.
- As a dietary supplement: 50-200 mcg/day

#### **Children:**

- AI for children varies with age: 0.2 mcg (0-6 months) to 35 mcg/day (14-18 years for males).
- *Pediatric safety*:  Use of chromium supplements in children should be supervised by a healthcare professional.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: AI for individuals over 50: 30 mcg/day for males, 20 mcg/day for females.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Dose adjustment may be necessary; monitor renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Dose adjustment may be necessary; monitor liver function.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Close monitoring of blood glucose is advisable for individuals with diabetes.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation**: No specific dosage recommendations for intubation.
- **Surgical Procedures**: No specific dosage recommendations for surgical procedures.
- **Mechanical Ventilation**: No specific dosage recommendations for mechanical ventilation.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**: No specific dosage recommendations for ICU use.
- **Emergency Situations**: No specific dosage recommendations for emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**
- Dosage adjustments should be made based on patient-specific factors like renal or hepatic impairment, concomitant medications, and blood glucose response.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
- Headache, dizziness, insomnia, mood changes, gastrointestinal upset (nausea, diarrhea).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
-  Cognitive impairment, difficulty concentrating, liver damage (rare), kidney damage (rare), allergic reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects**
- The long-term safety profile of high-dose chromium picolinate is not fully established. Some studies suggest a potential risk of renal and liver damage with prolonged high doses.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
- Rare cases of hepatitis, renal failure, and cognitive dysfunction have been reported.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to chromium picolinate.
- Severe renal or hepatic impairment. 
- Use with caution in patients with diabetes, especially those on insulin or other hypoglycemic medications.
- Known chromate/leather contact allergy.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Insulin and other antidiabetic drugs: Chromium picolinate may enhance the effects of these medications, leading to hypoglycemia.
- Corticosteroids: May decrease chromium levels.
- Levothyroxine: May decrease levothyroxine absorption.
- Antacids, H2 blockers:  May reduce chromium absorption.
- NSAIDs: May increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category**:  Adequate intake (AI) during pregnancy is 30 mcg/day. Higher doses should be used with caution and under medical supervision.
- **Fetal risks**: No definitive evidence of teratogenicity.
- **Breastfeeding**:  AI during breastfeeding is 45 mcg/day.  Excretion in breast milk is minimal, but high doses should be avoided.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action**: Enhances insulin action, improves glucose metabolism.
- **Side Effects**: Headache, insomnia, GI upset, rare liver/kidney dysfunction.
- **Contraindications**: Hypersensitivity, severe renal/hepatic disease.
- **Drug Interactions**: Insulin, corticosteroids, levothyroxine, antacids.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding**: Generally safe at AI levels.
- **Dosage**:  AI varies by age/gender; therapeutic doses 200-1000 mcg/day.
- **Monitoring Parameters**: Blood glucose levels, renal/hepatic function (with high doses).
