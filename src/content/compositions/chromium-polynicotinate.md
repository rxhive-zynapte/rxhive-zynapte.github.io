## **Usage**

- Chromium polynicotinate is primarily used as a dietary supplement to prevent or treat chromium deficiency. It is also sometimes used for improving blood sugar control in people with type 2 diabetes, though its efficacy for this purpose remains a subject of ongoing research.  It may also be used to treat impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia (especially beta blocker-related low HDL cholesterol) and dysthymic disorder (depression). Some promote it for weight loss, athletic performance enhancement, hypercholesterolemia, hypoglycemia, muscle mass building, and polycystic ovary syndrome, but evidence for these uses is insufficient.
- **Pharmacological classification**:  Essential trace mineral, glucose tolerance factor, insulin sensitizer.
- **Mechanism of action**: Chromium is an essential component of the "glucose tolerance factor" (GTF), a complex that enhances the binding of insulin to its receptors, thereby improving insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake by cells.

## **Alternate Names**

- Chromium nicotinate, chromium(III) polynicotinate
- Brand names vary widely; it is important to consult with a healthcare provider to verify the quality and chromium content of any chromium polynicotinate supplement.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Enhances insulin action, improves glucose tolerance, may affect lipid metabolism.
- **Pharmacokinetics**:  Absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is generally poor (less than 2.5% of ingested chromium is absorbed). The nicotinic acid moiety of chromium polynicotinate might improve absorption relative to other chromium forms.  Chromium is distributed widely in tissues. Elimination is primarily through urine.
- **Mode of action**: Chromium, within the GTF complex, potentiates insulin signaling.  The precise molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated but may involve modulation of tyrosine kinase activity and downstream signaling cascades within cells.
- **Elimination pathways**: Renal excretion is the major route of elimination.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Deficiency Prevention: 50-200 mcg/day. Therapeutic Doses: 200-1000 mcg/day, typically divided into multiple doses.
- Dosing adjustments may be necessary based on individual needs and tolerance.
- The upper limit for chromium is not clear, but experts typically recommend against exceeding 200 mcg without medical supervision.

#### **Children:**

- Dosing is based on age and adequate intake recommendations.
- Supplementation should be monitored by a healthcare provider.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Monitor renal function for appropriate adjustments.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage reduction is often required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Cautious use is advised.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider diabetes medications for potential interactions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Chromium polynicotinate is not typically used in acute care settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its role is primarily in long-term dietary management of chronic conditions.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Individual patient factors, renal and hepatic function, presence of metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms influencing drug metabolism warrant careful consideration.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Headache, insomnia, gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea, nausea, stomach pain), mood changes.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Liver dysfunction, renal impairment, anemia, irregular heartbeat.

### **Long-Term Effects**

- The long-term effects of chromium polynicotinate supplementation at high doses are not fully understood.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe liver damage or kidney damage are rare but possible ADRs.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to chromium, picolinic acid or any component of the supplement.
- Kidney disease, severe liver disease, chromate/leather allergy.
- Use cautiously with thyroid disorders.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Insulin and other antidiabetic drugs (potential for hypoglycemia).
- Corticosteroids, levothyroxine, antacids, beta-blockers, NSAIDs (potential alterations in absorption or metabolism).
- Vitamin B3 and vitamin C containing foods (may increase absorption).

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Should not be used during pregnancy and lactation unless under strict medical supervision. Adequate intake from food sources should be prioritized.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Enhances insulin action.
- **Side Effects:** Headache, insomnia, GI upset, mood changes, rarely liver/kidney dysfunction.
- **Contraindications:** Kidney/liver disease, chromium allergy, use cautiously in thyroid disorders.
- **Drug Interactions:** Insulin, antidiabetic drugs, levothyroxine, corticosteroids.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution under medical supervision.
- **Dosage:** 50-200 mcg/day for deficiency prevention; up to 1000 mcg/day for therapeutic use (under medical supervision).
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood glucose levels, liver and kidney function tests.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Often combined with other dietary supplements targeting blood sugar control or weight loss.
- However, the clinical benefits of such combinations are not well-established.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Evaluate renal and hepatic function before initiating therapy.
- **Specific Populations:**  Use cautiously in pregnant/breastfeeding women, children, and the elderly.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Diet should be considered for adequate chromium intake from food sources.
