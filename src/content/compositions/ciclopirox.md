## **Usage**

Ciclopirox is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent prescribed for the topical treatment of various fungal skin infections. These include:

*   Tinea corporis (ringworm of the body)
*   Tinea cruris (jock itch)
*   Tinea pedis (athlete's foot)
*   Tinea versicolor (sun fungus)
*   Cutaneous candidiasis (yeast infection of the skin)
*   Onychomycosis (fungal nail infection)
*   Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp

**Pharmacological Classification:** Topical Antifungal

**Mechanism of Action:** Ciclopirox inhibits the transport of essential elements like potassium and iron into fungal cells, disrupting fungal metabolism and growth. It also interferes with the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane.

## **Alternate Names**

Ciclopirox olamine (the salt form of ciclopirox often used in formulations)

**Brand Names:** Loprox, Penlac

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ciclopirox exerts its antifungal effect by:

*   Chelating polyvalent cations (like Fe3+ and Al3+), thus depriving the fungal cell of essential nutrients.
*   Inhibiting fungal enzyme systems involved in macromolecule biosynthesis.
*   Disrupting the structure and function of the fungal cell membrane.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Minimal systemic absorption occurs following topical application to intact skin (around 1.3%).  Nail lacquer formulations result in even lower systemic absorption (<5%).
*   **Metabolism:** Limited information is available on the metabolism of topical ciclopirox.
*   **Elimination:** Primarily excreted unchanged in urine following systemic absorption.


**Mode of Action:** Ciclopirox acts by disrupting the fungal cell membrane. It chelates polyvalent cations (e.g., Fe3+, Al3+), which inhibits the uptake of essential elements like potassium and iron, disrupting fungal metabolism and growth. It also interferes with ergosterol synthesis, affecting membrane integrity and cell division.

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Ciclopirox does not directly interact with human receptors or neurotransmitters. Its primary mechanism of action is targeted at fungal cells.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   **Cream, Lotion, Gel (0.77%):** Apply to affected and surrounding skin twice daily (morning and evening) for 2-4 weeks, depending on the infection.
*   **Shampoo (1%):** Apply 5-10 mL to wet hair, lather, leave for 3 minutes, and rinse. Repeat twice weekly for 4 weeks, with at least 3 days between applications.
*   **Nail Lacquer (8%):** Apply once daily to affected nails, preferably at bedtime. Remove with alcohol once weekly and reapply. Treatment may continue for 48 weeks or longer.

#### **Children:**

*   **Cream, Lotion, Gel (0.77%):** Use in children â‰¥10 years of age is generally considered safe, following adult dosing guidelines. Limited data exist for children under 10 years; consult specialist if deemed necessary.
*   **Shampoo (1%):**  Limited data exist for children under 16 years; consult specialist if deemed necessary.
*   **Nail Lacquer (8%):**  Use is generally accepted for children 12 years and older, following adult dosing guidelines.


#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Due to minimal systemic absorption, no dosage adjustment is necessary.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Due to minimal systemic absorption, no dosage adjustment is necessary.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific dosage adjustments are generally needed.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Ciclopirox is primarily used for topical dermatological applications. Its usage in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations is not relevant.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific dose modifications are usually necessary based on renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Burning or stinging sensation at the application site
*   Itching
*   Redness
*   Dryness


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Severe skin irritation
*   Allergic contact dermatitis (rash, blistering, swelling)



### **Long-Term Effects:** No significant long-term effects have been reported with topical ciclopirox use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** Severe allergic reactions are rare but possible.


## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to ciclopirox or any of its components.



## **Drug Interactions**

Topical ciclopirox has minimal systemic absorption, and drug interactions are rare. However, concomitant use with other topical medications on the same area should be done with caution.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

*   **Pregnancy:** Topical ciclopirox is generally considered safe during pregnancy. Animal studies have not shown any evidence of harm to the fetus. However, use only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk.
*   **Breastfeeding:** It is unknown if ciclopirox is excreted in breast milk. Use with caution while breastfeeding, and avoid applying it directly to the nipple area.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** Disrupts fungal cell membrane function by chelating cations and inhibiting ergosterol synthesis.
*   **Side Effects:**  Burning/stinging, itching, redness, dryness (common); allergic contact dermatitis (rare).
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Rare due to low systemic absorption.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe during pregnancy; caution advised during breastfeeding.
*   **Dosage:** See above.
*   **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for local skin reactions.

## **Popular Combinations**

Ciclopirox is sometimes combined with corticosteroids (e.g., clobetasol) for enhanced anti-inflammatory and antipruritic effects in treating certain conditions like seborrheic dermatitis.


## **Precautions**

*   **General Precautions:**  Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Discontinue use if irritation occurs.
*   **Specific Populations:**  See above sections on children, pregnancy, and breastfeeding.
*   **Lifestyle Considerations:** No specific lifestyle restrictions are associated with topical ciclopirox use.
