## **Usage**

Ciclosporin is an immunosuppressant medication primarily used to prevent organ rejection after transplantation (kidney, liver, heart).  It is also prescribed for the treatment of various autoimmune diseases, including severe rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, nephrotic syndrome, and uveitis.  Pharmacologically, ciclosporin is classified as a calcineurin inhibitor.  It works by inhibiting the activation of T lymphocytes, crucial components of the immune system responsible for attacking foreign tissues or, in the case of autoimmune diseases, the body's own tissues.

## **Alternate Names**

Ciclosporin is also known as cyclosporine, cyclosporin A, and cyclosporine modified. Brand names include Neoral, Sandimmune, Gengraf, and Ikervis (ophthalmic).

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ciclosporin exerts its immunosuppressive effects by selectively targeting T lymphocytes. It binds to cyclophilin, forming a complex that inhibits calcineurin. Calcineurin is essential for activating the transcription factor NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells), which promotes the expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2). IL-2 is a cytokine crucial for T cell proliferation and activation. By inhibiting IL-2 production, ciclosporin suppresses the immune response.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Oral absorption is variable and incomplete, influenced by food intake and the specific formulation used (e.g., Neoral, Sandimmune).  Modified formulations offer improved and more consistent absorption.
* **Distribution:** Ciclosporin is highly lipophilic and extensively distributes into tissues, including erythrocytes and lipoproteins.
* **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, primarily CYP3A4, producing several metabolites, some of which possess immunosuppressive activity.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through biliary excretion into feces, with a small portion excreted in urine. The terminal half-life is highly variable (approximately 18 hours), and clearance is influenced by liver function.

**Mode of Action:**  Ciclosporin inhibits the activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes by preventing the transcription of IL-2 and other cytokines involved in the immune response. It binds to cytosolic protein cyclophilin, forming a complex that then inhibits the phosphatase activity of calcineurin. This inhibition blocks the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NFAT, thus preventing its binding to the IL-2 promoter region and reducing IL-2 production.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily biliary excretion via feces; hepatic metabolism by CYP3A4 enzymes plays a significant role. Minor renal excretion.



## **Dosage**

Ciclosporin dosage is highly individualized based on the patient's condition, age, weight, organ function, and other factors. Therapeutic drug monitoring is essential to ensure appropriate blood levels and minimize toxicity.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  The initial dose varies depending on the indication.  For organ transplantation, the initial oral dose is typically 15 mg/kg/day divided into two doses, starting 4-12 hours before transplantation.  For autoimmune conditions, starting doses are lower, usually between 2.5 to 5 mg/kg/day divided twice daily.  Maintenance doses are adjusted based on therapeutic drug monitoring.

#### **Children:** Pediatric dosing is weight-based and requires careful monitoring. For organ transplantation, initial doses are similar to adults, while autoimmune disease doses are lower and individualized.  Higher doses per kg of body weight may be required in children than in adults.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Reduced doses may be necessary due to age-related decline in renal function. Close monitoring of renal function and blood pressure is crucial.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are required based on the degree of renal impairment. Lower starting doses and careful monitoring are essential.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Ciclosporin metabolism is mainly hepatic. Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with hepatic impairment, especially if they have significantly impaired liver function.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Careful consideration should be given to patients with conditions like hypertension, diabetes, or other metabolic disorders as cyclosporine can exacerbate these conditions.  Dosage adjustment and close monitoring might be necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Ciclosporin dosages in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations are determined by the underlying condition being treated (organ transplant rejection or autoimmune disease) and require individualization based on patient factors and therapeutic drug monitoring.  No standard dosages exist specifically for these settings.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are frequently required based on blood trough levels, clinical response, and the occurrence of adverse effects.  Patients with renal or hepatic impairment, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting CYP3A4 activity require specific dose adjustments and close monitoring.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

* Nephrotoxicity (kidney damage)

* Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)
* Headache


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Infections (due to immunosuppression)
* Seizures
* Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
* Anaphylactic reactions
* Malignancies (increased risk of certain cancers)
* Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)


### **Long-Term Effects:**

## **Drug Interactions**


Ciclosporin has numerous clinically significant drug interactions.  It is metabolized by CYP3A4 and can act as both a substrate and an inhibitor of this enzyme.

* **CYP450 Interactions:** Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (e.g., azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics, calcium channel blockers) can increase ciclosporin levels, leading to toxicity.  Drugs that induce CYP3A4 (e.g., rifampin, anticonvulsants) can decrease ciclosporin levels, reducing efficacy.

* **Other Interactions:**
    * Nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides, NSAIDs): increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
    * Potassium-sparing diuretics: increased risk of hyperkalemia.
    * Statins: increased risk of myopathy.
    * Grapefruit juice: inhibits CYP3A4, increasing ciclosporin levels.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (FDA). Ciclosporin can cross the placenta and is associated with an increased risk of prematurity and low birth weight.  Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:** Ciclosporin is excreted into breast milk. Breastfeeding is generally contraindicated during ciclosporin therapy due to the potential for immunosuppression and other adverse effects in the infant.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Calcineurin inhibitor; suppresses T lymphocyte activation and IL-2 production.
* **Side Effects:** Nephrotoxicity, hypertension, tremor, hirsutism, gingival hyperplasia, infections.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, uncontrolled hypertension, infections, malignancy, breastfeeding.
