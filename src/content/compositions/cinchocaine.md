## **Usage**

Cinchocaine is a local anesthetic, primarily used to provide temporary relief from pain and itching associated with minor skin irritations such as burns (including sunburn), cuts, abrasions, insect bites, and hemorrhoids. It is also prescribed for anorectal conditions like anal fissures.  It can be found in some ear drop solutions.  It's pharmacological classification is local anesthetic.

Cinchocaine's mechanism of action involves blocking nerve impulse conduction by decreasing cell membrane permeability to sodium ions. This action prevents pain signals from reaching the brain.

## **Alternate Names**

Cinchocaine is also known as Dibucaine. Brand names include Nupercainal, Nupercaine, Sovcaine, Proctosedyl (often in combination with other medications like hydrocortisone), Faktu (with policresulen), and Scheriproct (with prednisolone).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cinchocaine's primary effect is to induce local anesthesia by stabilizing neuronal membranes and inhibiting sodium influx, thus preventing depolarization and nerve impulse propagation.  The duration of action is typically 2-4 hours.

**Pharmacokinetics:** When applied topically, absorption through intact skin is minimal, especially for the ionized salt forms. However, absorption is increased through broken or inflamed skin. Cinchocaine is primarily metabolized in the liver. Elimination pathways are not well documented, however, limited systemic absorption suggests renal and hepatic excretion of metabolites.


**Mode of Action:** Cinchocaine binds to voltage-gated sodium channels in nerve cell membranes, blocking the influx of sodium ions required for nerve impulse transmission. This results in a localized loss of sensation, including pain and itching.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Cinchocaine's main mechanism involves the reversible binding to sodium channels, rather than enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** As a 0.5% ointment or cream: Apply a small amount to the affected area 3-4 times daily, not exceeding 30g in a 24-hour period. As a suppository (5mg): Insert one suppository in the rectum twice a day (morning and evening) and after each bowel movement for up to 7 days.

#### **Children:**  For children 2 years and older, use the ointment 3-4 times a day, not exceeding 7.5g in 24 hours. Use in children under 2 years of age is not generally recommended, and should only be done under the guidance of a pediatrician.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: Use with caution due to potential for increased systemic absorption and sensitivity.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Caution is advised due to potential accumulation of metabolites. Dose adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**:  Metabolism may be impaired, so dose adjustments might be needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Cinchocaine interacts with certain medications, like antiarrhythmics. Careful consideration is necessary for those with heart conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Cinchocaine is generally not indicated for clinical procedures like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use where deeper and more controlled anesthesia is required.  It is not typically used in emergency situations.  Its use is restricted to minor, topical anesthesia.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
Adjustments are required based on patient factors like renal or hepatic impairment and age. Drug interactions also necessitate dose modifications.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Localized reactions such as burning, itching, irritation, redness, and contact dermatitis at the application site.  These are generally mild and transient.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing), systemic toxicity (dizziness, headache, confusion, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias), and methemoglobinemia (cyanosis, shortness of breath, fatigue).

### **Long-Term Effects**

Skin atrophy or thinning with prolonged topical corticosteroid use (when cinchocaine is in combination products), potential for skin sensitization and increased risk of infection.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Allergic reactions, systemic toxicity, and methemoglobinemia necessitate immediate medical intervention.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to cinchocaine or other amide local anesthetics, infected or broken skin, pyogenic infections near the application site, certain types of skin infections, severe burns, and use near eyes, nose, or mouth. In combination preparations containing hydrocortisone: tuberculosis, viral lesions (herpes simplex, chicken pox).



## **Drug Interactions**

Other local anesthetics (additive toxicity), certain antiarrhythmics (increased risk of cardiac side effects), muscle relaxants and other anesthetic agents (prolonged muscle weakness, respiratory depression), anticoagulants (increased bleeding risk), CYP3A4 inhibitors (ritonavir, cobicistat) - increased risk of systemic side effects including adrenal suppression, and drugs metabolized by the liver (potential for altered metabolism of Cinchocaine).



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult individual product information for combined formulations. Cinchocaine as a single ingredient is not recommended for routine use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Topical application carries a minimal risk of fetal exposure, but should be used cautiously and only when the benefits outweigh the risks.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Blocks nerve impulse conduction by inhibiting sodium influx into nerve cells.
- **Side Effects:** Localized irritation, allergic reactions, systemic toxicity, methemoglobinemia.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, infected skin, severe burns, use near eyes/nose/mouth.
- **Drug Interactions:** Other local anesthetics, antiarrhythmics, muscle relaxants, anticoagulants, CYP3A4 inhibitors, some hepatic metabolized drugs.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Caution advised, use only when benefit outweighs risk.
- **Dosage:** Varies by formulation and indication, generally applied topically several times daily or as suppositories.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Observe application site for irritation or allergic reactions, monitor for signs of systemic toxicity.

## **Popular Combinations**

Hydrocortisone (anti-inflammatory), prednisolone (anti-inflammatory), policresulen (tissue regenerating agent), neomycin (antibiotic), esculin (venotonic, strengthens capillaries).



## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions**: Avoid use on broken or infected skin, avoid contact with eyes/nose/mouth, assess patient for allergies, hepatic or renal impairment.
- **Specific Populations**:
    - **Pregnant Women**: Use with caution, consult product information for combination preparations.
    - **Breastfeeding Mothers**: Use with caution, consult product information for combination preparations.
    - **Children & Elderly**: Use with caution in children, especially under 2 years. Elderly may be more sensitive.
- **Lifestyle Considerations**: Alcohol consumption might worsen potential side effects. Driving is generally unaffected unless systemic absorption occurs and causes dizziness.
