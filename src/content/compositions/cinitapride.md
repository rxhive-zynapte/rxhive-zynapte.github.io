      How does Cinitapride differ from other prokinetic agents?**


      **A:** Cinitapride has a multi-faceted mechanism involving 5-HT4 agonism,
      5-HT2 antagonism, and D2 antagonism, potentially offering broader benefits
      in motility disorders compared to agents with a single mechanism.

## **Usage**

Cinitapride is prescribed for gastrointestinal disorders associated with motility disturbances.  These include:

*   Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
*   Non-ulcer dyspepsia
*   Delayed gastric emptying (Gastroparesis)
*   Functional dyspepsia

**Pharmacological Classification:** Gastroprokinetic agent (5-HT4 receptor agonist, 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, and D2 receptor antagonist).

**Mechanism of Action:** Cinitapride enhances gastrointestinal motility by increasing acetylcholine concentrations, stimulating 5-HT4 receptors, and blocking 5-HT2 and dopamine D2 receptors. This leads to increased coordinated contractions of the stomach and intestinal muscles, promoting faster movement of food through the digestive tract. It also tightens the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), preventing acid reflux.

## **Alternate Names**

There is no internationally recognized non-proprietary name other than Cinitapride.

**Brand Names:**  Cinita, Cintapro,  Cinmove, CT Pride, Biopride, Gasotin, Nupenta-CP, Acepride.  (This list may not be exhaustive and can vary by region.)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cinitapride primarily acts on the gastrointestinal tract by increasing motility. This prokinetic effect is mediated through multiple mechanisms:

*   **5-HT4 Receptor Agonism:** Stimulates these receptors in the gut, enhancing acetylcholine release, which increases gut muscle contractions and improves motility.
*   **5-HT2 Receptor Antagonism:** Blocks these receptors, further contributing to enhanced gut motility and reducing some side effects associated with 5-HT2 agonism.
*   **Dopamine D2 Receptor Antagonism:** Contributes to its antiemetic properties and plays a role in its prokinetic effects.
*   **Cholinergic effects:** Enhances the action of acetylcholine

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Rapidly absorbed after oral administration.
*   **Metabolism:** First-pass metabolism in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 enzymes.
*   **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated via biliary excretion, with some renal excretion. Elimination half-life of 3-5 hours initially, followed by a longer residual half-life of over 15 hours. No accumulation observed with repeated doses.
*   **Tmax**: Approximately 2 hours after oral administration.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   1 mg orally three times daily, 15 minutes before meals.
*   Dosage may be reduced based on patient age and symptoms.

#### **Children:**

Not recommended due to lack of safety and efficacy data.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to increased risk of side effects. Dosage adjustment may be required.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution advised. Dose adjustments may be required based on creatinine clearance.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution, especially in severe cases. Dosage adjustments may be needed.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient factors. Close monitoring is recommended.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Specific dosage recommendations for Cinitapride in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations haven't been established.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications should be considered based on individual patient factors, including renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

*   Headache
*   Dizziness
*   Nausea
*   Diarrhea
*   Drowsiness
*   Dry mouth
*   Abdominal discomfort


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

*   Extrapyramidal symptoms (involuntary muscle movements, spasms of face, neck, and tongue)
*   Allergic reactions (rash, itching, angioedema)
*   Gynecomastia


### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential long-term effects are not well-established.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs requiring immediate intervention include severe allergic reactions, extrapyramidal symptoms, and cardiac arrhythmias (although rare).


## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to cinitapride or any component of the formulation.
*   Gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction, or perforation.
*   Tardive dyskinesia.



## **Drug Interactions**

*   **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:**  May increase cinitapride levels, potentially increasing the risk of side effects.
*   **QT Prolonging Drugs:** Concomitant use may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
*   **Drugs affecting electrolyte balance**: Caution is advised, as these could enhance the effects of cinitapride.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Cinitapride should not be used during the first trimester of pregnancy.  Use in later trimesters and during breastfeeding should be considered only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus or infant.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:**  Prokinetic agent, 5-HT4 agonist, 5-HT2 antagonist, D2 antagonist.
*   **Side Effects:** Headache, dizziness, nausea, diarrhea, drowsiness, extrapyramidal symptoms (rare).
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, GI bleeding/obstruction/perforation, tardive dyskinesia.
*   **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors, QT prolonging drugs.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Not recommended in the first trimester, use with caution in later stages and during breastfeeding.
*   **Dosage:** 1 mg thrice daily before meals.
*   **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for extrapyramidal symptoms and other adverse reactions.



## **Popular Combinations**

Cinitapride is sometimes combined with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like pantoprazole or rabeprazole for enhanced efficacy in managing GERD and other acid-related disorders.


## **Precautions**

*   **General Precautions:** Assess for allergies, pre-existing GI conditions, and concomitant medications.
*   **Specific Populations:**  Use with caution in elderly patients, those with renal/hepatic impairment, and pregnant/breastfeeding women.
*   **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid alcohol as it might exacerbate some side effects. Caution advised when driving or operating machinery due to potential drowsiness.
