## **Usage**

Cisplatin is primarily prescribed for the treatment of various types of cancer, including:

* **Metastatic testicular cancer:** In combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, after surgery and/or radiotherapy.
* **Metastatic ovarian cancer:** As a single agent or in combination (e.g., with cyclophosphamide), after surgery and/or radiotherapy.
* **Advanced bladder cancer:** As a single agent, when local treatments are no longer viable.
* **Other cancers:** Cisplatin may be used off-label for other malignancies like osteogenic sarcoma, neuroblastoma, head and neck cancers, melanoma, anal cancer, and recurrent brain tumors.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Antineoplastic agent (alkylating agent).

**Mechanism of Action:** Cisplatin binds to DNA, forming intrastrand and interstrand crosslinks, which disrupts DNA replication and transcription, ultimately leading to cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

**International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Cisplatin

**Brand Names:** Platinol-AQ, CISplatin

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cisplatin exerts its cytotoxic effects by binding to DNA and forming crosslinks that prevent DNA replication and transcription.  This ultimately leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (programmed cell death).

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Administered intravenously, therefore 100% bioavailable at the administered dose.
* **Distribution:** Widely distributed throughout the body, with high concentrations found in the kidneys, liver, and intestines.
* **Metabolism:** Minimal metabolism occurs.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated by the kidneys through glomerular filtration and tubular secretion, with some biliary excretion. The elimination half-life is prolonged in patients with renal impairment.

**Mode of Action:** Cisplatin enters the cell and undergoes aquation, where chloride ligands are replaced by water molecules.  This activated form binds to purine bases on DNA, primarily guanine, forming intrastrand and interstrand crosslinks. These crosslinks distort the DNA helix, inhibiting DNA replication and RNA transcription.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Cisplatin's primary mechanism is DNA crosslinking. No significant receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation is associated with its anticancer effects.

**Elimination Pathways:** Cisplatin is primarily eliminated by the kidneys via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. A small amount is excreted in the bile.


## **Dosage**

Cisplatin dosing is individualized and depends on the type of cancer, patient's condition, and other concurrent treatments. It is crucial to calculate the dosage based on body surface area (mg/m²).

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Testicular Cancer:** 20 mg/m²/day IV for 5 days, repeated every 3-4 weeks, usually in combination with other chemotherapy.
* **Ovarian Cancer:**  75-100 mg/m² IV every 3-4 weeks in combination with other agents like cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m² administered sequentially).  As a single agent, 100 mg/m² IV every 4 weeks.
* **Bladder Cancer:** 50-70 mg/m² IV every 3-4 weeks as a single agent. Initial dose of 50 mg/m² every 4 weeks for heavily pre-treated patients.

#### **Children:**

* **Osteogenic Sarcoma/Neuroblastoma:** 90 mg/m² IV every 3 weeks OR 30 mg/m² IV weekly (off-label).
* **Recurrent Brain Tumors:** 60 mg/m² IV daily for 2 days, repeated every 3-4 weeks (off-label).
* **General Pediatric Considerations:** Cisplatin dosing in children should be carefully determined by an experienced pediatric oncologist. Renal function and hearing should be closely monitored.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose reduction may be required due to age-related decline in renal function. Closer monitoring of renal function and other side effects is essential.  Lower doses and more frequent administration may be considered.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Cisplatin is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment. Dose adjustment is mandatory in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, and dose adjustments may be needed. Liver function tests should be monitored.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage modifications should be considered based on the specific comorbidity and its impact on drug clearance or toxicity.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Cisplatin administration is not typically indicated in situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations outside of its oncological use.  Its use is reserved for specific cancer treatment regimens.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with renal impairment, hepatic dysfunction, and other comorbid conditions.  Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism may also influence dosing.
