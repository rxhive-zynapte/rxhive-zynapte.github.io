## **Usage**

Citicoline is prescribed for conditions affecting brain function, including:

* **Stroke (Ischemic):** To potentially improve functional recovery and reduce neurological deficits.
* **Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI):** To manage cerebral edema and potentially improve cognitive outcomes.
* **Cognitive Impairment:**  In cases of vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and other cognitive disorders, although clinical evidence is inconsistent.  
* **Parkinson's Disease:** As a potential adjunctive therapy.



**Pharmacological Classification:**  Citicoline is classified as a psychostimulant and nootropic agent, with neuroprotective properties. Some sources categorize it as an oral nutritional supplement.

**Mechanism of Action (Brief):** Citicoline is a natural intermediary in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, a major constituent of cell membranes. It supports neuronal membrane integrity and function, improves cerebral blood flow, and modulates neurotransmitter systems.

## **Alternate Names**

* **Cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine (CDP-choline)**
* **CDPC**

**Brand Names:**  Somazina, CerAxon, NeurAxon,  Syschol-500, Tidicholine. (This is not an exhaustive list and may vary by region.)

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Citicoline enhances neuronal membrane integrity by providing the building blocks for phosphatidylcholine synthesis.  It also:

* Improves cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption.
* Reduces cerebral edema.
* Increases levels of acetylcholine, norepinephrine, and dopamine.
* Inhibits apoptosis (programmed cell death) in neurons.


**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Citicoline is well-absorbed orally and is rapidly converted to cytidine and choline.
* **Metabolism:** Metabolized in the gut and liver.
* **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion. Specific CYP enzyme involvement is not well-documented.

**Mode of Action:**  Citicoline acts at the cellular and molecular levels to:

* **Phospholipid synthesis:** Increases phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin synthesis, crucial for neuronal membrane repair.
* **Neurotransmitter modulation:** Positively modulates acetylcholine, norepinephrine, and dopamine levels, improving neuronal communication.
* **Neuroprotection:** Reduces neuronal damage by inhibiting apoptosis and excitotoxicity.
* **Cerebral blood flow:** May improve cerebral blood flow by increasing nitric oxide synthesis.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Specific receptor binding is not definitively characterized. Citicoline inhibits certain phospholipases and may interact with enzymes related to oxidative stress.


## **Dosage**

Dosage guidelines vary based on the condition, route of administration, and patient factors. Always refer to specific product information and tailor dosage based on individual patient response and tolerance.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral:** 500-2000 mg daily, divided into two doses.
* **Intravenous (IV) or Intramuscular (IM):** 500-2000 mg daily. IV administration should be slow (over 3-5 minutes) or via infusion (40-60 drops/minute).

#### **Children:**

Limited data are available for pediatric dosing. 

* **IV:** Some studies have used 10 mg/kg every 12 hours for specific conditions (e.g., post-cardiac arrest, HIE).
* Always consult pediatric dosage guidelines and adjust based on weight and age.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment may not be necessary, but monitor for adverse effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Adjust dose based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution and consider dose reduction.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient circumstances and adjust accordingly.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage varies widely in clinical settings and should be tailored to the specific situation:

* **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:** Often administered IV at doses ranging from 500 to 2000 mg daily.
* **Emergency Situations (e.g., cardiac arrest):**  IV administration for faster onset. Dosage varies by specific protocol.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

* Consider dose modifications for renal/hepatic impairment, metabolic disorders, or genetic factors affecting drug metabolism.
