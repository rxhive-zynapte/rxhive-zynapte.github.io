      How does citric acid help prevent kidney stones?**


      **A:** Citric acid inhibits crystallization and stone formation, primarily
      by binding to calcium, thereby reducing the saturation of calcium oxalate
      and calcium phosphate, and increasing urine citrate levels, which inhibits
      stone formation.

## **Usage**

Citric acid, in combination with its salts (sodium citrate, potassium citrate), is primarily used as a urinary alkalinizer to treat metabolic acidosis, prevent kidney stones (uric acid and cystine), and manage acidosis in renal tubular disorders. It is also used to increase the pH of urine and blood.  It is not an endothelin receptor antagonist. Citric acid on its own has additional uses such as a flavoring agent and an antioxidant synergist.


## **Alternate Names**

Citric acid is also referred to as 2-hydroxy-1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid. Combination preparations include citric acid with sodium citrate and/or potassium citrate. These combinations are often referred to as "oral citrates," and several brand names exist, such as Bicitra, Cytra-2,  Liqui-Dual Citra, Oracit, Polycitra, and Virtrate-3.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Citrate salts primarily act as alkalinizing agents. They are metabolized in the liver (â‰¥95%) to bicarbonate, which increases blood and urinary pH.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
* **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver by oxidation to bicarbonate.
* **Elimination:** Less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

For urinary alkalinization: 10 to 30 mL of the solution diluted in water, four times a day after meals and at bedtime, or as directed by a physician. For other specific conditions, 1-2 g of sodium citrate every 2-4 hours may be administered.

#### **Children:**

Dosage must be individualized based on the child's age, weight, and clinical condition. For urinary alkalinization, typical doses range from 5-15 mL of solution, diluted in water, after meals and at bedtime, or as directed by a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosages should be adjusted based on kidney function and overall health status.  Lower dosages may be required.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Contraindicated in severe renal impairment. Dosage must be adjusted based on the degree of impairment.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Citrate metabolism may be impaired.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in cardiovascular disease, edema, hypertension, and other relevant comorbid conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The available sources primarily focus on using citric acid/citrate combinations for urinary alkalinization. Therefore, no specific dosage information is available for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are needed for patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Electrolyte and acid-base balance should be closely monitored, particularly in these patients.  If using potassium-containing formulations, caution should be exercised in patients receiving therapies that affect potassium levels.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (particularly with frequent administration or high doses).


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (hives, difficulty breathing, swelling), metabolic alkalosis (with excessive intake), hypocalcemia (if using citrate for anticoagulation).


### **Long-Term Effects**

Erosion of tooth enamel with frequent or prolonged use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Hyperkalemia (with potassium-containing preparations), metabolic disturbances, aluminum toxicity (increased absorption with oral citrates), tetany (due to hypocalcemia), cardiac arrhythmias (due to electrolyte imbalances).


## **Contraindications**

Severe renal impairment, untreated Addison's disease, severe myocardial damage, hyperkalemia (with potassium-containing formulations), anuria, severe dehydration, adynamia episodica hereditaria, heat cramps.


## **Drug Interactions**

Aluminum-containing antacids (increased aluminum absorption), potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors (increased risk of hyperkalemia), digitalis glycosides (altered potassium levels may affect digitalis activity).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult with a physician before using citric acid/citrate combinations during pregnancy or breastfeeding. The safety profile during these periods needs careful consideration.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Alkalinizes urine and blood by being metabolized to bicarbonate.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, allergic reactions, metabolic disturbances, tooth erosion.
* **Contraindications:** Severe renal impairment, untreated Addison's disease, hyperkalemia, anuria.
* **Drug Interactions:** Aluminum antacids, potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, digitalis.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult a physician.
* **Dosage:**  Adult: 10-30 mL solution four times daily, diluted in water. Pediatric: individualized.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Serum electrolytes, arterial blood gas, urine pH.


## **Popular Combinations**

Citric acid is frequently combined with sodium and/or potassium citrate for urinary alkalinization.


## **Precautions**

Monitor electrolyte balance and acid-base status, especially in patients with renal or hepatic disease, heart failure, or hypertension. Potassium-containing preparations should be used cautiously in patients at risk of hyperkalemia. Prolonged or excessive use may cause tooth erosion.
