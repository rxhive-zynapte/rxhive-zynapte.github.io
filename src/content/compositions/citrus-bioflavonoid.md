## **Usage**

Citrus bioflavonoids are primarily used as dietary supplements for their antioxidant properties. They are often taken in combination with Vitamin C to enhance its absorption and effectiveness.  While they are studied for potential benefits in various health conditions like osteoarthritis, cardiovascular health, and immune support, their clinical efficacy in treating specific diseases is not yet definitively established.  They are generally classified as antioxidants and vasoprotective agents.  The proposed mechanism of action involves scavenging free radicals, reducing inflammation, and supporting capillary health.

## **Alternate Names**

- Bioflavonoids
- Citrus Flavones
- Vitamin P (obsolete term)

Some brand names include Bio C 1000 and Pause XT.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Citrus bioflavonoids exert antioxidant effects by scavenging free radicals, thereby reducing oxidative stress and inflammation.  They are also believed to improve capillary permeability and strengthen blood vessel walls.  

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Absorption of citrus bioflavonoids varies depending on the specific flavonoid and the food matrix. They are metabolized in the liver and gut by enzymes, including CYP3A4. Elimination pathways include both renal and hepatic excretion.  Grapefruit, a source of citrus bioflavonoids, can interact with numerous medications, including some calcium channel blockers, benzodiazepines, statins, and cyclosporine, mostly through inhibition of the CYP3A4 enzyme.

**Mode of Action:** Citrus bioflavonoids act as antioxidants, neutralizing free radicals and preventing oxidative damage to cells.  They may also influence enzyme activity and modulate cellular signaling pathways.

## **Dosage**

Dosage recommendations for citrus bioflavonoids are not standardized and vary depending on the specific product and intended use.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

A common supplemental dose is up to 600 mg per day, often taken in divided doses with meals. Some supplements may contain higher doses.


#### **Children:**

No standard pediatric dosage is established for citrus bioflavonoid supplements. Consultation with a pediatrician is necessary.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are established, but careful monitoring is advised.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be needed. Consult a nephrologist.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment may be needed. Consult a hepatologist.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with bleeding disorders or those taking anticoagulants.

### **Clinical Use Cases:**

Citrus bioflavonoids are not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments may be required based on individual patient factors such as renal or hepatic impairment, concomitant medications, and other health conditions. Consultation with a physician is crucial.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Generally, citrus bioflavonoids are well-tolerated.  Mild side effects may include nausea, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, skin rash, itching, blurred vision, and nervousness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (hives, difficulty breathing, swelling) are rare but require immediate medical attention.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term effects of high-dose supplementation are not fully understood and warrant further research.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Clinically significant ADRs are uncommon but can include allergic reactions.

## **Contraindications**

Citrus bioflavonoids should be avoided in individuals with known hypersensitivity to citrus fruits or bioflavonoids. Caution is advised in patients with bleeding disorders or those taking anticoagulants.

## **Drug Interactions**

Citrus bioflavonoids, especially those derived from grapefruit, can interact with several medications metabolized by CYP3A4, including some calcium channel blockers, statins, benzodiazepines, and cyclosporine.  They may also interact with warfarin. It's important to discuss any potential interactions with a physician or pharmacist.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Data on the safety of citrus bioflavonoids during pregnancy and breastfeeding is limited.  Consult a healthcare professional before use.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, vasoprotective.
- **Side Effects:** Generally well-tolerated; mild gastrointestinal issues and allergic reactions possible.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, bleeding disorders (caution), concomitant use of certain medications (e.g., warfarin, CYP3A4 substrates).
- **Drug Interactions:**  CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers, warfarin.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult healthcare professional.
- **Dosage:** Up to 600 mg/day for adults (supplemental use).  No established pediatric dose.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  None specifically established for supplemental use.

## **Popular Combinations**

Citrus bioflavonoids are often combined with Vitamin C to enhance absorption and synergistic antioxidant effects.

## **Precautions**

- Assess for allergies to citrus fruits before use.
- Caution advised in patients with bleeding disorders or taking anticoagulants.
- Consult a healthcare professional before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.
