## **Usage**

Clindamycin is an antibiotic prescribed for the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria, as well as some aerobic gram-positive bacteria like staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci.  It is effective against infections such as:

* Serious respiratory tract infections (pneumonia, empyema, lung abscess)
* Skin and soft tissue infections (cellulitis, abscesses, impetigo)
* Septicemia
* Intra-abdominal infections
* Infections of the female pelvis and genital tract (pelvic inflammatory disease, endometritis)
* Bone and joint infections (osteomyelitis)
* Bacterial vaginosis
* Acne (topical formulation)

**Pharmacological Classification:** Lincosamide antibiotic.

**Mechanism of Action:** Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit, preventing peptide bond formation. This bacteriostatic action halts bacterial growth and allows the immune system to eliminate the infection.



## **Alternate Names**

Clindamycin Hydrochloride (oral), Clindamycin Phosphate (IV, topical)

**Brand Names:** Cleocin, Dalacin C, Clindagel (topical)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Clindamycin exerts its bacteriostatic effect by binding to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, blocking protein synthesis. This prevents further growth of the bacteria, enabling the immune system to eradicate the infection.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Orally administered clindamycin is well-absorbed, and food does not significantly affect absorption.  Peak serum concentrations are reached in approximately 45 minutes (oral) and 3 hours (IM). IV administration provides immediate therapeutic levels.
* **Distribution:** Clindamycin is widely distributed in body tissues and fluids, including bone, but does not readily penetrate the cerebrospinal fluid, even in the presence of inflamed meninges.
* **Metabolism:** Clindamycin is primarily metabolized in the liver via CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP3A5, to clindamycin sulfoxide (active but less potent) and N-desmethylclindamycin.
* **Elimination:** Excreted primarily in the urine (10% as active drug and metabolites) and feces (4%). The elimination half-life is approximately 3 hours (oral/IV), but it can be prolonged in patients with hepatic impairment.

**Mode of Action:**  Clindamycin binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit, specifically to the 23S rRNA within this subunit. This binding interferes with the transpeptidation and translocation steps of protein synthesis, ultimately halting bacterial protein production.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Clindamycin targets the bacterial ribosome, not human receptors or enzymes, resulting in selective toxicity against bacteria.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral:** 150-450 mg every 6 hours (not to exceed 1.8 g/day).  For more severe infections, 300-450 mg every 6 hours.
* **IV/IM:** 600-1200 mg/day divided every 6-12 hours (not to exceed 4.8 g/day). For severe infections, 1200-2700 mg/day divided every 6-12 hours (up to 4.8 g/day IV).

#### **Children:**

* **Oral:**
    * < 10 kg:  37.5 mg three times a day (minimum recommended dose).
    * ≥ 10 kg:  8-16 mg/kg/day divided every 6-8 hours for serious infections.
         16-25 mg/kg/day divided every 6-8 hours for severe infections (not to exceed adult dose).
* **IV/IM:**
    * < 7 days old : <2kg(or older than 7 days old, <1.2kg): 10 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours.
     >2kg (or older than 7 days old, 1.2-2kg): 15mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours.
    * 1 month - 16 years: 20-40 mg/kg/day divided every 6-8 hours.  (Can also use body surface area (BSA) based dosing: 350 mg/m²/day for serious infections; 450 mg/m²/day for severe infections).

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments are generally not necessary unless there is significant hepatic or renal impairment.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are usually not required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Close monitoring of plasma concentrations is recommended, and dosage adjustments or increased dosing intervals may be necessary in severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with a history of gastrointestinal disease, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing for clinical use cases typically follows the standard adult or pediatric dosing guidelines as mentioned above, adjusted according to the severity of the infection.  Clindamycin is often used pre-operatively for surgical prophylaxis, particularly for procedures involving the gastrointestinal tract or female genital tract.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on the patient's renal or hepatic function, concomitant medications, and the severity of infection. Closely monitor patients with renal or hepatic impairment for potential drug accumulation and adjust the dose or dosing interval as needed.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain
* Metallic taste
* Skin rash


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea (CDAD) (can be severe and life-threatening)
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)



### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term use of clindamycin can lead to antibiotic resistance and an increased risk of recurrent *C. difficile* infections.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** CDAD requires prompt medical attention and may necessitate discontinuation of clindamycin and treatment with appropriate antibiotics like vancomycin or fidaxomicin.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to clindamycin or lincomycin
* History of CDAD or ulcerative colitis
* Regional enteritis



## **Drug Interactions**

* **Neuromuscular blocking agents:** Enhanced neuromuscular blockade (e.g., succinylcholine, vecuronium).
* **CYP3A4 inhibitors:** Increased clindamycin levels (e.g., azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics, some HIV protease inhibitors).
* **CYP3A4 inducers:** Decreased clindamycin levels (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine).
* **Oral contraceptives:** Potential decrease in efficacy of oral contraceptives.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  B (animal studies have not demonstrated fetal risk, but there are no adequate controlled studies in pregnant women). Generally considered safe in the second and third trimesters. Use with caution in the first trimester.
* **Breastfeeding:** Clindamycin is excreted in breast milk.  Monitor infants for potential gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea, diaper rash, or bloody stools. If possible, an alternate drug may be preferred.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, *C. difficile* infection (rare but serious).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, history of CDAD.
