## **Usage**

Clobetasol is a super-high potency topical corticosteroid prescribed for short-term treatment of inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, such as eczema, psoriasis (excluding widespread plaque psoriasis), and other skin conditions that haven't responded well to less potent steroids.  It is classified as a corticosteroid.  Clobetasol works by reducing inflammation, itching, and swelling by inducing the production of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins (lipocortins). These proteins control the biosynthesis of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes.

## **Alternate Names**

Clobetasol propionate is the active ingredient. Brand names include Dermovate, ClobaDerm, Etrivex, Impoyz, and others.  There may be other international or regional brand names.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Clobetasol propionate possesses anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. It binds to glucocorticoid receptors in the skin, leading to decreased production of inflammatory cytokines and mediators.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Clobetasol is primarily applied topically. Systemic absorption is minimal with intact skin but can increase with prolonged use, application to large areas, or use of occlusive dressings, potentially causing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. Metabolism and elimination pathways are not fully characterized for topical application, but some systemic absorption can lead to hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.

**Mode of Action:**  The drug binds to glucocorticoid receptors, modulating gene transcription and suppressing the inflammatory cascade by inhibiting the release of arachidonic acid, a precursor to inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily topical action; minimal systemic absorption is metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
Apply a thin layer to affected areas twice daily (morning and evening). The maximum weekly dose should not exceed 50g.  Treatment duration typically ranges from a few days to a maximum of 2-4 weeks, depending on the condition and response. Some patients may respond to once-daily or intermittent application.

#### **Children:**
Use in children under 12 years of age is generally not recommended for most formulations. For children over 12 (or as specified by the specific product), application may be twice daily, but limit treatment duration to a few days if possible, and review weekly. Never use for longer than five days without medical supervision.



#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Similar to adult dosing but start at the lower end of the dosage range and titrate carefully due to potential age-related decreases in hepatic, renal, or cardiac function.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be needed; caution is advised.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, although specific dosage adjustments are not typically recommended for topical clobetasol.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient factors and comorbidities when determining treatment duration and frequency.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Clobetasol is not generally indicated for the clinical use cases listed (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, Emergency Situations).  Its primary use is limited to topical skin conditions.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be necessary based on patient response, treatment area, and the severity of the dermatosis. Always use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**
Burning, stinging, itching, dryness, skin thinning (atrophy), hypopigmentation, telangiectasia, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Allergic contact dermatitis, skin infections, HPA axis suppression (with prolonged or extensive use), Cushing's syndrome (rare), glaucoma, cataracts (with ocular exposure), hyperglycemia.


### **Long-Term Effects:**
Skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, and persistent hypopigmentation.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
Severe allergic reactions (angioedema, urticaria), skin necrosis, secondary infections.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to clobetasol propionate or any component of the formulation. Rosacea, acne vulgaris, perioral dermatitis, primary cutaneous viral infections (herpes simplex, varicella), fungal infections, bacterial infections.


## **Drug Interactions**

Although limited with topical application, concurrent use of CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole) may increase systemic absorption and the risk of side effects.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category: C (Topical). Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.  Avoid application to large areas, prolonged use, or high doses during pregnancy.  It is unknown if topical clobetasol is excreted in breast milk.  Caution is advised when using clobetasol during breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Binds to glucocorticoid receptors, reducing inflammation.

* **Side Effects:** Burning, stinging, skin atrophy, HPA axis suppression (with prolonged use).

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, rosacea, acne, infections.

* **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors.

* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; potential fetal risks.

* **Dosage:** Apply thinly twice daily; maximum 50g/week for up to 2-4 weeks.

* **Monitoring Parameters:** Signs of skin atrophy, HPA axis suppression, local infection.



## **Popular Combinations**

Clobetasol is sometimes combined with other topical agents, such as antifungals or antibacterials, for treating dermatoses with secondary infections.  These combinations should only be used when prescribed by a doctor.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Avoid contact with eyes, broken skin, or mucous membranes.  Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.

* **Specific Populations:**  As described in the dosage section.

* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Alcohol and smoking are not directly related to topical clobetasol use.  No driving restrictions are usually associated with topical clobetasol.
