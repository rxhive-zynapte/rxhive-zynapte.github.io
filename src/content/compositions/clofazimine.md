## **Usage**

Clofazimine is primarily used in combination with other anti-leprosy medications for the treatment of lepromatous leprosy, including dapsone-resistant lepromatous leprosy and lepromatous leprosy complicated by erythema nodosum leprosum.  It is classified as a **riminophenazine dye** with **antimycobacterial** and **anti-inflammatory** properties.  Its mechanism of action involves binding to bacterial DNA, inhibiting mycobacterial growth and replication. It also exhibits anti-inflammatory effects, likely by interfering with the production and release of inflammatory mediators.

## **Alternate Names**

The drug is also recognized internationally as Clofazimine.  A common brand name under which it is marketed is Lamprene.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Clofazimine exerts its primary therapeutic effect by binding to the guanine bases of bacterial DNA, thereby disrupting DNA replication and leading to bacterial cell death. It also has anti-inflammatory effects, possibly by impairing the function of neutrophils and monocytes and reducing the release of TNF-alpha and other inflammatory mediators.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Clofazimine is absorbed slowly and incompletely from the gastrointestinal tract.  Absorption is enhanced when taken with food.
* **Distribution:** It is widely distributed throughout the body, accumulating in fatty tissues, including the liver, spleen, and skin. It also crosses the placenta and is present in breast milk.
* **Metabolism:** Clofazimine undergoes some hepatic metabolism, but the pathways are not fully elucidated.
* **Elimination:** The drug and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the feces, with a small amount eliminated in urine.  The elimination half-life is quite long, ranging from several weeks to months, resulting in slow clearance from the body.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Lepromatous Leprosy (Dapsone-sensitive):** 100 mg daily in combination with rifampicin and dapsone, administered for at least 2 years.
* **Lepromatous Leprosy (Dapsone-resistant):** 100 mg daily in combination with one or more other anti-leprosy drugs for 3 years, followed by 100 mg daily as monotherapy.
* **Erythema Nodosum Leprosum:** 100-200 mg daily, in conjunction with other anti-leprosy drugs and steroids, for up to 3 months.

#### **Children:**

* **Multibacillary Leprosy:**
    * **â‰¤10 years:**  Dose adjustment is necessary (e.g., 50 mg twice weekly + 100 mg once monthly, with rifampicin and dapsone).
    * **10-14 years:** 50 mg every other day + 150 mg once monthly, with rifampicin and dapsone.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be needed based on organ function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use caution in severe renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution; dose adjustment might be necessary.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  Clofazimine is not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its principal indication is leprosy treatment.




## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Skin discoloration (pink to brownish-black)
* Dry skin
* Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* QT prolongation
* Splenic infarction
* Bowel obstruction
* Gastrointestinal bleeding



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to clofazimine

## **Drug Interactions**

* Drugs that prolong the QT interval
* Rifampin
* Hormonal contraceptives




## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Clofazimine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. Effective contraception should be used during treatment and for at least 4 months afterward.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Clofazimine is excreted in breast milk and may cause skin discoloration in infants.  Breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Binds to mycobacterial DNA, inhibiting growth and replication. Also exhibits anti-inflammatory effects.
* **Side Effects:** Skin discoloration, dry skin, gastrointestinal disturbances, eye discoloration, discoloration of body fluids.  Rarely, QT prolongation, splenic infarction, bowel obstruction.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:** QT-prolonging drugs, rifampin, hormonal contraceptives.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Should generally be avoided.
* **Dosage:**  Adults: 100-200 mg daily; Children: dose adjustment needed.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Monitor for liver function, gastrointestinal issues, and QT prolongation.
* **Specific Populations:** Avoid or use with caution in pregnancy and breastfeeding; use with caution in hepatic impairment.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Advise patients about skin discoloration and the need for sun protection.
