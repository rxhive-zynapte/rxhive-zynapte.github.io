## **Usage**

Clomipramine is primarily prescribed for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). It helps reduce obsessions (persistent/unwanted thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive tasks). It's also used to treat depression, panic disorder, and chronic pain conditions.

Its pharmacological classifications include tricyclic antidepressant and serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI).

Clomipramine's mechanism of action involves increasing the availability of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain by inhibiting their reuptake. This neurotransmitter modulation influences mood regulation and obsessive-compulsive behaviors.

## **Alternate Names**

Clomipramine is also known as Anafranil (brand name).  There are generic versions available internationally.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Clomipramine primarily blocks the reuptake of serotonin and, to a lesser extent, norepinephrine at presynaptic nerve terminals, thereby increasing their concentration in the synaptic cleft. This enhances serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission. It also exhibits anticholinergic, antihistaminic, and alpha-adrenergic blocking properties, which contribute to its side effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Clomipramine is well-absorbed orally.
* **Metabolism:** It's extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6, to its active metabolite desmethylclomipramine (DMC).
* **Elimination:**  Primarily eliminated through renal and hepatic routes. The half-life is variable, ranging from 21 to 31 hours for clomipramine and 32 to 89 hours for DMC, impacting the time to reach steady-state plasma levels (2–3 weeks).

**Mode of Action:** Clomipramine binds to the serotonin transporter (SERT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET), inhibiting the reuptake of these neurotransmitters. Its stronger affinity for SERT makes it more potent in enhancing serotonergic activity, crucial in treating OCD.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Primarily SERT and NET inhibition. Anticholinergic activity through muscarinic receptor blockade.  CYP2D6 is the primary enzyme involved in its metabolism; therefore, drug interactions involving CYP2D6 inducers or inhibitors are important to consider.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic (CYP2D6 mediated) and renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Initial: 25 mg orally once daily, preferably at bedtime.

Gradual increase:  Increase by 25 mg increments every 3-4 days as tolerated, divided with meals to reduce gastrointestinal upset, up to 100 mg/day within two weeks.

Maintenance: 100–150 mg/day, up to a maximum of 250 mg/day.  Higher doses may be necessary for OCD and panic disorder.

#### **Children (10 years and older):**

Initial: 25 mg orally once daily, preferably at bedtime.

Gradual increase: Increase by 25 mg increments every 3-4 days as tolerated, divided with meals, up to a maximum of 3 mg/kg/day or 100 mg/day (whichever is less) within two weeks.

Maintenance:  May increase further to 200 mg/day or 3 mg/kg/day (whichever is less).


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Initiate with a lower dose (10 mg/day) and titrate cautiously, typically not exceeding 30–75 mg/day.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution and initiate at lower doses.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage modifications may be required.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Clomipramine's standard dosing applies to its primary indications (OCD, depression, panic disorder). Specific dosage adjustments for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not routinely recommended or established.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Individualize dosage based on patient response, tolerability, and comorbid conditions. Renal/hepatic impairment warrants careful titration and lower initial doses. Drug interactions (especially with CYP2D6 inhibitors) may necessitate dose reductions.


## **Side Effects**

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category: C.

Fetal risks: Potential for neonatal withdrawal syndrome if used near term. Monitor infants for adverse effects (poor feeding, irritability, respiratory distress).

Breastfeeding: Clomipramine and its metabolites are present in breast milk. Weigh the risks and benefits. Monitor infants for sedation, poor feeding, and developmental effects.

## **Popular Combinations**

Combining clomipramine with other antidepressants or augmentation with antipsychotics is generally not recommended due to increased side effects and potential drug interactions.
