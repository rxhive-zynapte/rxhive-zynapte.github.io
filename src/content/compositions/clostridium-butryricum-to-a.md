# Clostridium butyricum TO-A

## **Usage**

Clostridium butyricum TO-A is primarily used as a probiotic in food supplements to promote gut health.  It's not classified as a drug in the traditional sense (like an antibiotic or analgesic), but rather as a novel food ingredient.  Its mechanism of action involves promoting a healthy balance of intestinal microbiota.


## **Alternate Names**

While "Clostridium butyricum TO-A" is the most precise name for this specific strain, it's sometimes referred to simply as "C. butyricum TO-A." Miyarisan Pharmaceutical markets a different strain under the name CBM 588. This differs from the novel food, Clostridium butyricum TO-A, which is marketed as a white-grey powder consisting of live C. butyricum TO-A at 1 x 10<sup>9</sup> cfu/g with potato starch.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  C. butyricum TO-A exerts its effects primarily within the gastrointestinal tract. It produces short-chain fatty acids, especially butyrate, which serves as the primary energy source for colonocytes and promotes a healthy intestinal environment. Butyrate contributes to reducing inflammation, enhancing the intestinal barrier function, and modulating the immune system.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  As a spore-forming bacterium, C. butyricum TO-A can survive the harsh acidic conditions of the stomach and germinate in the intestine. While it doesn't permanently colonize the gut, its transient presence and metabolic activity contribute to modulating the existing gut microbiota.  The ingested spores germinate into vegetative cells that produce butyrate. Elimination occurs primarily through the feces as the bacteria do not permanently colonize the host.  Specific details on absorption, distribution, and metabolism are not available for C. butyricum TO-A itself, but generally, the bacteria are not absorbed from the gut into the bloodstream.  Specific receptor binding or enzyme inhibition by the bacteria itself has not been thoroughly characterized.

**Mode of Action:** The primary mode of action is through the production of butyrate.  Butyrate influences gene expression in colonocytes, modulates immune responses, and impacts gut motility.

## **Dosage**

Dosage information specifically for Clostridium butyricum TO-A is limited, as its primary use is as a food supplement and not a medication. Studies have used various dosages in animals, including in feed for goats at 2.0 x 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/kg and 1.0 x 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/kg, and in mice an oral dose exceeding 10g/kg body weight. These dosages are not directly applicable to humans. It's essential to follow the manufacturer's recommended dosage for food supplements containing C. butyricum TO-A.

### **Standard Dosage**

Not established for medical use.

#### **Adults:**

Dosage guidelines are product-specific. Consult the product label or a healthcare professional.

#### **Children:**

Due to limited safety data, it's best to consult a pediatrician before giving C. butyricum TO-A supplements to children.

#### **Special Cases:**

No specific dosage adjustments are available for special populations. Consult a healthcare professional for guidance.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

C. butyricum TO-A is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgery, or the ICU. Its main application is as a dietary supplement to support gut health.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Not applicable as a medicinal product.

## **Side Effects**

Generally, C. butyricum is considered safe, but some individuals might experience mild gastrointestinal discomfort, such as bloating or gas.  Acute toxicity tests in mice have shown that the maximum tolerated oral dose was more than 10g/kg body weight.  It is important to note that TO-A is a new strain.

### **Common Side Effects**

Potentially mild gastrointestinal discomfort.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Not typically observed.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Unknown.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Not typically applicable to probiotics.

## **Contraindications**

Individuals with known allergies to C. butyricum or any components of the supplement should avoid it.

## **Drug Interactions**

No specific drug interactions have been documented.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Limited safety data are available regarding C. butyricum TO-A use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Consult a healthcare professional before use.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

Not applicable in the traditional sense, as it's a probiotic, not a drug.

## **Popular Combinations**

Not applicable.

## **Precautions**

General precautions include monitoring for any allergic reactions or gastrointestinal issues.
