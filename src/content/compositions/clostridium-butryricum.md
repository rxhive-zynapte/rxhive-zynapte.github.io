## **Usage**

* **Medical Conditions:** *Clostridium butyricum* is primarily used as a probiotic for the treatment of various gastrointestinal disorders, including antibiotic-associated diarrhea,  and to support overall gut health.

* **Pharmacological Classification:** Probiotic

* **Mechanism of Action:** *C. butyricum* exerts its therapeutic effects mainly through the production of butyric acid, a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA). Butyrate serves as the primary energy source for colonocytes, promoting a healthy gut environment by:
    * Inhibiting the growth of pathogenic bacteria
    * Enhancing the growth of beneficial bacteria
    * Improving intestinal barrier function
    * Modulating the immune system.


## **Alternate Names**

* *Clostridium butyricum* TO-A
* Miya-Gold EU (contains *Clostridium butyricum* MIYARI 588)
* Miya-Gold S (contains *Clostridium butyricum* MIYARI 588)


## **How It Works**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** *C. butyricum* produces butyrate, which acts as an energy source for colonocytes, promotes a healthy gut microbiome, and modulates immune responses.

* **Pharmacokinetics:**  While specific pharmacokinetic data isn't readily available for *C. butyricum* as a probiotic, it is generally considered safe and well-tolerated. It primarily colonizes the gut and its effects are localized within the gastrointestinal tract. Butyrate produced by *C. butyricum* is absorbed by colonocytes and contributes to their energy metabolism.

* **Mode of Action/Receptor binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter modulation:** *C. butyricum*'s main mechanism of action is through the production of butyrate. Butyrate has multiple effects on intestinal cells:
    * **Energy Source:** Butyrate is the preferred energy source for colonocytes, promoting their health and integrity.
    * **Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) Inhibition:** Butyrate acts as an HDAC inhibitor, influencing gene expression and potentially having anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects.
    * **G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation:** Butyrate can also activate certain GPCRs, affecting gut motility and secretion.

* **Elimination Pathways:** Butyrate produced by *C. butyricum* is primarily metabolized by colonocytes for energy. Excess butyrate may be absorbed and metabolized by the liver or excreted in the feces.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**
