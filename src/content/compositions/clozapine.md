## **Usage**

Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic prescribed for:

* **Treatment-resistant schizophrenia:** In patients who have not responded adequately to standard antipsychotic treatment.
* **Reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior:** In patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder judged to be at chronic risk.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Atypical antipsychotic.

**Mechanism of Action:**  Clozapine has a complex pharmacology, binding to multiple receptors including dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5HT6 and 5-HT7, alpha-adrenergic, muscarinic, and histamine H1 receptors. Its unique efficacy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia is thought to be related to its relatively high affinity for serotonin 5-HT2A receptors compared to D2 receptors and the complex interplay between its receptor interactions.



## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely used alternate names for clozapine.

**Brand Names:** Clozaril, Versacloz.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Clozapine's antipsychotic effects are likely due to its combined antagonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors.  It impacts other receptors, contributing to its side effect profile, including muscarinic receptors (anticholinergic effects), histamine H1 receptors (sedation, weight gain), and alpha-adrenergic receptors (hypotension).

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Clozapine is rapidly absorbed orally, with a bioavailability of 60-70%
* **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP1A2, with contributions from CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. The major metabolite is norclozapine (N-desmethylclozapine), which has some pharmacological activity.
* **Elimination:** Primarily through renal excretion (50%) and fecal excretion (30%), with elimination half-life is usually between 4 to 12 hours depending on the individual and their metabolism.

**Mode of Action:**  Clozapine binds to multiple receptors in the brain, modulating neurotransmission. Its higher affinity for 5-HT2A over D2 is unique among antipsychotics and is thought to be a key factor in its efficacy in treatment-resistant patients.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Clozapine acts as an antagonist at multiple receptors, including dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5HT6, and 5HT7, alpha-adrenergic, muscarinic, and histamine H1. It does not directly inhibit enzymes but can impact drug metabolism via CYP1A2 induction.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Clozapine is metabolized primarily by CYP1A2 in the liver and is eliminated through renal and fecal excretion.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Initial:** 12.5 mg once or twice daily.
* **Titration:** Increase by 25-50 mg/day, if tolerated, to 300-450 mg/day by the end of two weeks.
* **Maintenance:** Adjust to the lowest effective dose, typically 300-450mg/day. Maximum dose 900 mg/day.

#### **Children:**

Safety and efficacy not established in children under 18.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose (12.5 mg/day) and titrate more slowly.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce dose in patients with moderate to severe impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Reduce dose and monitor liver function tests.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider interactions with other medications and adjust accordingly.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Clozapine is not indicated for use in situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary use is in the long-term management of treatment-resistant schizophrenia and reducing suicidal behavior.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary for:

* Renal impairment
* Hepatic dysfunction
* Co-administration with CYP1A2 inhibitors (reduce clozapine dose)
* Co-administration with CYP1A2 inducers (increase clozapine dose)
* CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (reduce clozapine dose).
