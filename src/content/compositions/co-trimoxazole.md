## Usage

Co-trimoxazole is a combination antibiotic used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. It is prescribed for infections like:

* Urinary tract infections (UTIs)
* Acute otitis media (ear infections) in children
* Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis
* Shigellosis (bacillary dysentery)
* Traveler's diarrhea
* Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), both for treatment and prevention (prophylaxis)
* Toxoplasmosis, both for treatment and prevention
* Nocardiosis

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic

**Mechanism of Action:** Co-trimoxazole works by inhibiting the synthesis of folic acid, a crucial nutrient for bacterial growth and survival. It does this by targeting two different enzymes in the folic acid pathway: sulfamethoxazole inhibits dihydropteroate synthase, and trimethoprim inhibits dihydrofolate reductase. This dual-action mechanism makes it more effective than using either drug alone (synergistic effect) and helps to reduce the development of resistance.


## Alternate Names

**International Nonproprietary Name (INN):**  Co-trimoxazole

**Other Names:**  Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim,  TMP-SMX,  TMP-SMZ

**Brand Names:** Bactrim, Septra, Cotrim


## How It Works

**Pharmacodynamics:** Co-trimoxazole exerts a bactericidal effect by sequentially blocking two enzymes in the bacterial folic acid synthesis pathway.  This synergistic action disrupts the production of essential nucleic acids, ultimately leading to bacterial death. Human cells are not affected because they obtain folic acid from dietary sources rather than synthesizing it.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Orally administered co-trimoxazole is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily hepatic, with sulfamethoxazole undergoing acetylation and glucuronidation, and trimethoprim undergoing oxidation and hydroxylation.
* **Elimination:** Both components are primarily excreted in the urine, with a small amount excreted in the feces.
* **Mode of Action:** Inhibits bacterial folic acid synthesis as described above.  
* **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Co-trimoxazole acts by inhibiting the bacterial enzymes dihydropteroate synthase (by sulfamethoxazole) and dihydrofolate reductase (by trimethoprim).
* **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion, with some hepatic metabolism and fecal excretion.


## Dosage


### Standard Dosage

#### Adults:

* **Standard dose:** 160 mg trimethoprim/800 mg sulfamethoxazole every 12 hours.
* **Duration:** Variable depending on the infection; typically 5-14 days.

#### Children:

* **Dosage:** Calculated based on weight (6 mg trimethoprim/30 mg sulfamethoxazole per kg body weight per day, divided into two doses).  Dose should not exceed adult dose
* **Safety:** Use with caution in infants under 6 weeks old. Avoid in neonates less than 2 months of age.

#### Special Cases:

* **Elderly Patients:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal function. Monitor for hyperkalemia.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage reduction is needed based on creatinine clearance (CrCl). Not recommended for CrCl <15 mL/min.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution advised; monitor liver function tests.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring is warranted in patients with folate deficiency, G6PD deficiency, or other conditions.

### Clinical Use Cases

The standard adult or pediatric dosage applies unless otherwise specified by guidelines or an infectious disease specialist.

* **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use/Emergency Situations:** Dosing determined by the specific infection being treated and is often guided by local guidelines and susceptibility patterns.


### Dosage Adjustments

As indicated above for renal impairment, hepatic dysfunction, and special populations. Therapeutic drug monitoring may be needed in some situations.


## Side Effects


### Common Side Effects

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Rash
* Oral thrush
* Vaginal thrush

### Rare but Serious Side Effects

* Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)
* Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)
* Severe skin reactions
* Bone marrow suppression (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia)
* Hepatic necrosis
* Hyperkalemia
* Kidney failure

### Long-Term Effects

With prolonged use, potential for bone marrow suppression, kidney damage, and antibiotic-associated colitis.

### Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)

As listed above in rare but serious side effects. Any sign of these ADRs requires immediate discontinuation and supportive care.


## Contraindications

* Hypersensitivity to sulfonamides or trimethoprim
* Megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency
* Infants younger than 2 months of age
* Pregnant women at term and nursing mothers (during the first 6 weeks postpartum, G6PD deficiency, or if the baby is jaundiced).
* Marked liver parenchymal damage
* Severe renal insufficiency where repeated measurements of the plasma concentration cannot be performed


## Drug Interactions

Co-trimoxazole has numerous potential drug interactions:

* **Warfarin:** Increased risk of bleeding.
* **Phenytoin:** Increased phenytoin levels.
* **Sulfonylureas:** Increased risk of hypoglycemia.
* **Methotrexate:** Increased methotrexate toxicity.
* **Digoxin:** Increased digoxin levels.
* **ACE inhibitors:** Increased risk of hyperkalemia.
* **Diuretics (thiazides):** Increased risk of thrombocytopenia and hyperkalemia.


## Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Generally avoided during pregnancy, especially the first trimester and near term. If used during pregnancy, folate supplementation should be considered.
* **Fetal Risks:** Increased risk of congenital malformations, especially neural tube defects.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Small amounts are excreted in breast milk. Generally not recommended during the first 6 weeks postpartum, in mothers with G6PD deficiency, or if the baby is jaundiced.  Avoid in infants <8 weeks of age due to the risk of hyperbilirubinemia
