## **Usage**

Coal tar is prescribed for inflammatory skin conditions like psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff), and eczema.  It's classified as a keratoplastic, keratolytic, and antipruritic agent. Coal tar slows rapid skin cell growth, reduces inflammation, and relieves itching.

## **Alternate Names**

Liquor carbonis detergens (LCD), pix lithanthracis


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Coal tar suppresses epidermal cell proliferation and has anti-inflammatory and antipruritic effects.  The exact mechanism is not fully understood but involves multiple pathways, possibly including inhibiting DNA synthesis and altering keratinocyte differentiation.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Coal tar is primarily applied topically. Absorption is minimal with topical application, but some systemic absorption can occur with extensive use or high concentrations. Metabolism and elimination pathways are not well-defined for topical application.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
Creams/ointments/lotions/gels: Apply a thin layer to the affected area 1-4 times daily.
Shampoo: Massage into wet scalp, leave for several minutes, and rinse thoroughly. Use 1-2 times per week.

#### **Children:**
Generally, similar dosing to adults, but always follow product-specific recommendations. For children under 12, dilution with water might be advised (consult product instructions or physician).



#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Similar dosing to adults but start with the lowest concentration and monitor closely for skin irritation.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustments are typically needed for topical application.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments are typically needed for topical application.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  No specific adjustments unless the comorbidity involves the affected skin area.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  

Coal tar is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.  Its primary use is for the topical management of dermatological conditions.



### **Dosage Adjustments**  

Adjustments may be necessary based on individual response and tolerability. Start with the lowest concentration and increase as needed.


## **Side Effects**
