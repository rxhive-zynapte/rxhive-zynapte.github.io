## **Usage**

- Cod liver oil is primarily used as a dietary supplement to provide omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA), vitamin A, and vitamin D.  It's often recommended for individuals with deficiencies in these nutrients.  While not a drug per se, it has been used for various conditions, though evidence for efficacy varies. These include high cholesterol, high triglycerides, kidney disease in diabetes patients, high blood pressure, heart disease, osteoarthritis, depression, autoimmune diseases, glaucoma, middle ear infections, skin problems, burns, and wounds. It's also prescribed to prevent vitamin deficiencies in people with restricted diets or impaired absorption and in patients with an increased vitamin need from chronic diseases or infections.

- **Pharmacological Classification**:  Supplement (provides vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids). It's not classified as a drug in the same way as antibiotics or analgesics.

- **Mechanism of Action**: Cod liver oil supplements the diet with omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA), which are thought to have anti-inflammatory effects and may contribute to cardiovascular health.  Vitamins A and D have various roles in the body, including maintaining vision, bone health, and immune function.

## **Alternate Names**

- Cod liver oil is generally known by that name.  Sometimes it is referred to as just "fish oil," though "fish oil" can refer to other marine oil supplements.

- **Brand Names:**  Seven Seas Cod Liver Oil, Scott's Emulsion, Dispeas 1000, and various generic formulations.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**:  Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) primarily affect eicosanoid pathways, influencing inflammation and platelet aggregation. Vitamin A is essential for vision, cell growth, and immune function. Vitamin D contributes to calcium absorption, bone health, and immune modulation.

- **Pharmacokinetics**:  Cod liver oil components are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract.  Omega-3 fatty acids are incorporated into cell membranes and metabolized through various pathways. Vitamins A and D are stored in the liver and fatty tissues.

- **Mode of Action (Cellular/Molecular Level):** EPA and DHA can modulate gene expression related to inflammation. Vitamin A binds to nuclear receptors affecting cell differentiation and growth. Vitamin D similarly influences gene transcription related to calcium homeostasis and immune function.

- **Elimination Pathways**:  Metabolites of omega-3 fatty acids are eliminated through bile and urine.  Excess vitamin A and D are slowly excreted.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- Liquid: 1 tablespoon (15-20 mL) daily.
- Capsules:  Dosage varies by product. General recommendation for adults is 1-3 capsules daily with 250-1000mg. (As of February 16, 2025). Consult specific product instructions for guidance.
- Maximum daily dose should be considered due to potential vitamin A and D toxicity. 

#### **Children:**
- Dosage depends on age and formulation. Consult product information and pediatric guidelines for appropriate dosages. For children aged 2-12, 1 teaspoon (5mL) of the liquid form per day is suggested. For the capsules, the recommendation varies depending on age groups: 1 capsule for age 6, 2 capsules twice a day for age 7-10, 3 capsules a day for age 11-13, and 4 capsules twice a day for children older than 14.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:**  No specific adjustments are typically needed, but monitor for potential vitamin A and D toxicity.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustments are typically recommended.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution due to potential impact on vitamin A and D metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized assessment is needed based on specific comorbidities.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Cod liver oil is not typically administered in hospital settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be needed based on individual factors, comorbidities, and response. Monitor vitamin A and D levels to avoid toxicity.



## **Side Effects**
