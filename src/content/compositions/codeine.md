## **Usage**

Codeine is an opioid analgesic prescribed for the relief of mild to moderately severe pain. It also has antitussive properties and can be used to suppress coughs.  It belongs to the pharmacological classifications of opioid analgesics and antitussives.

Codeine itself is a prodrug, meaning it's metabolized by the body into its active form, morphine. Morphine binds to opioid receptors in the central nervous system, reducing the perception of pain and suppressing the cough reflex.

## **Alternate Names**

- Methylmorphine

**Brand Names:**  Codeine is often found in combination medications with brand names varying depending on the formulation and country. Some examples include:

- Tylenol with Codeine
- Co-codamol


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Codeine primarily acts as a prodrug, converting to morphine in the liver via the CYP2D6 enzyme. Morphine binds to mu-opioid receptors in the brain, spinal cord, and other tissues, resulting in decreased pain perception and cough suppression.  It also has some effect on kappa and delta opioid receptors.  Codeine's analgesic effect is considerably weaker than morphine's.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

- **Absorption:** Codeine is readily absorbed orally.
- **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP2D6 to morphine, norcodeine, and codeine-6-glucuronide.  Genetic variations in CYP2D6 activity significantly influence codeine's effectiveness and risk of adverse effects. Ultra-rapid metabolizers convert codeine to morphine very quickly, leading to higher morphine levels and increased risk of toxicity. Poor metabolizers may not experience adequate pain relief.
- **Elimination:**  Metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine.

**Mode of Action:** Mu-opioid receptor binding inhibits neuronal activity by reducing neurotransmitter release and altering ion channel conductance. This leads to decreased pain signaling in the ascending pathways and suppression of the cough reflex in the medulla.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of metabolites.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Analgesia:** 15-60 mg orally every 4-6 hours as needed, not to exceed 360mg/24h.
- **Antitussive:** 10-20 mg orally every 4-6 hours as needed, not to exceed 120 mg/24h.

#### **Children:**

Codeine is generally **not recommended** for children under 12 years old due to the risk of respiratory depression, especially in ultra-rapid metabolizers.  If used in older children (12-18 years), the dose should be carefully determined by a physician based on weight and clinical condition, not to exceed 240mg/24h.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Lower initial dose and careful titration due to potential age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose reduction and careful monitoring are necessary due to decreased clearance. For creatinine clearance 10-50 mL/min, reduce dose by 25%.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Codeine should be avoided or used with extreme caution and dose reduction due to altered metabolism and unpredictable effects.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful evaluation is required, especially in patients with respiratory conditions, CNS depression, or a history of substance abuse.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Codeine is generally **not recommended** in the following settings due to the availability of safer and more effective alternatives:

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations**

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are required based on individual patient factors such as renal/hepatic function, age, and concomitant medications.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  C (Consult a medical professional for advice)
- Fetal risks include respiratory depression, neonatal abstinence syndrome, and birth defects. 
- Codeine is excreted in breast milk and can cause serious side effects in nursing infants, especially in ultra-rapid metabolizers. Use alternative analgesics if possible.

- Codeine + Ibuprofen: Increased pain relief and reduced inflammation.

## **Precautions**

- Assess respiratory function, especially in patients with underlying respiratory disease.
