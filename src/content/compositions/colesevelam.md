## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Colesevelam is prescribed as an adjunct to diet and exercise to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in adults with primary hyperlipidemia (including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia). It is also used to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  In boys and postmenarchal girls (10-17 years old), it is used to lower LDL-C levels with HeFH when target LDL-C levels cannot be met with diet and lifestyle changes alone.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Bile acid sequestrant.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Colesevelam binds to bile acids in the intestine, preventing their reabsorption. This leads to increased conversion of cholesterol to bile acids in the liver, reducing LDL-C levels.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:** None specifically listed.
- **Brand Names:**  Welchol®, Cholestagel®

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Colesevelam lowers LDL-C by binding bile acids in the intestine, thereby interrupting their enterohepatic circulation. This promotes increased hepatic conversion of cholesterol to bile acids, resulting in lower serum LDL-C levels. It may also modestly increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and lower triglycerides. For individuals with Type 2 Diabetes, it improves glycemic control, possibly by delaying glucose absorption.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Colesevelam is not absorbed systemically, it remains within the gastrointestinal tract and is eliminated in the feces. It does not undergo metabolism by CYP enzymes.
- **Mode of Action:** Colesevelam is a non-absorbed polymer that binds bile acids in the intestine, forming a non-absorbable complex. The complex is then excreted in the feces.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**  Binds bile acids. No significant interaction with CYP450 enzymes.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily eliminated in feces as a bile acid complex.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (Primary Hyperlipidemia and Type 2 Diabetes):**

- **Tablets:** 3.75 g daily (six 625 mg tablets) administered as a single dose or in two divided doses of 3 tablets each, taken with meals and liquid.
- **Oral Suspension:** 3.75 g (one packet) daily, taken with meals and liquid.  Mix with water, juice, or diet soda.

#### **Children (HeFH, 10-17 years old):**

- **Tablets:** 3.75 g daily (six 625 mg tablets) administered as a single dose or in two divided doses of 3 tablets each, taken with meals and liquid.
- **Oral Suspension:** 3.75 g (one packet) daily, taken with meals and liquid. Due to tablet size, the oral suspension is generally recommended for children. Mix with water, juice or diet soda.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment is necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor triglyceride levels, especially in patients with levels ≥ 300 mg/dL or a history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis. Exercise caution in patients with bowel obstruction or gastrointestinal disorders. If vitamin K or fat-soluble vitamin deficiency is suspected, monitor vitamin levels. 


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Colesevelam does not have any applications in the clinical scenarios listed below. It is indicated for chronic conditions: hyperlipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and lifestyle modification. It is not used in acute clinical situations:
- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations**


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Generally, no dosage adjustments are needed for age, renal function, or hepatic function. However, individual patient response may necessitate adjustments.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
- Constipation
- Flatulence
- Upset stomach
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Indigestion
- Headache
- Muscle pain

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
- Bowel obstruction (symptoms include severe abdominal pain and severe constipation)
- Pancreatitis (symptoms include severe pain in the upper abdomen radiating to the back, nausea, and vomiting)
- High triglyceride levels
- Allergic reactions

### **Long-Term Effects:**
- Potential for malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) with long-term use.  Monitor and supplement as necessary.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
- As above in Rare but Serious Side Effects.


## **Contraindications**

- Bowel obstruction
- Triglyceride levels > 500 mg/dL
- History of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis
- Hypersensitivity to colesevelam


## **Drug Interactions**

Colesevelam can reduce the absorption of various medications, including:
- Cyclosporine
- Glimepiride
- Glipizide
- Glyburide
- Levothyroxine
- Olmesartan
- Phenytoin
- Warfarin
- Oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone
- Vitamins (A, D, E, and K)

To minimize interactions, administer other medications at least 4 hours before or after colesevelam. It can also bind to bile acids and reduce the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Monitor patients for these potential interactions and adjust dosages as needed.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** B. Limited human data are available on the use of colesevelam during pregnancy. It is not expected to harm a fetus due to its non-systemic absorption. Consult with a physician if considering use during pregnancy. 
- **Breastfeeding:** Colesevelam is not absorbed systematically and is not expected to be present in breast milk, posing minimal risk to a nursing infant. Consult with a physician before using while breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Bile acid sequestrant; binds bile acids in the intestine.
- **Side Effects:** Constipation, flatulence, upset stomach, nausea, bowel obstruction, pancreatitis, increased triglycerides, allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Bowel obstruction, high triglycerides (>500 mg/dL), history of hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis.
- **Drug Interactions:** Numerous, often requiring separated dosing by 4 hours; decreases absorption of several medications and potentially fat-soluble vitamins.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category B; caution advised; generally considered low risk due to limited systemic absorption.
- **Dosage:** 3.75 g daily in adults and children 10-17 years old with primary hyperlipidemia or type 2 diabetes.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, liver function tests, and coagulation parameters (if indicated) before and during treatment.



## **Popular Combinations**

Colesevelam is often used in combination with statins, ezetimibe or other lipid-lowering drugs to achieve greater reductions in LDL-C levels.
