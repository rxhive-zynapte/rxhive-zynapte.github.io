## **Usage**

Collagen peptides are primarily used for improving skin hydration and elasticity, potentially reducing wrinkles. They are also used for dry skin and may help with joint pain associated with osteoarthritis.  There is growing interest in its use for other conditions like osteoporosis, brittle nails, and muscle strength, but more research is needed to confirm these benefits.  Collagen peptides are classified as a nutritional supplement, not a drug.

## **Alternate Names**

Hydrolyzed collagen, collagen hydrolysate.  Specific brand names are numerous and vary depending on the manufacturer.  Some sources mention specific brand names like Thorne Collagen Plus Powder

## **How It Works**

### **Pharmacodynamics**

Ingested collagen peptides are broken down into amino acids and absorbed in the gut. These amino acids then act as building blocks for collagen and other proteins in the body. They may stimulate fibroblast activity, promoting collagen synthesis in the skin, and chondrocyte activity, leading to cartilage regeneration. The improved skin hydration and elasticity are likely due to increased collagen content in the dermis. The potential benefit in joint conditions may be due to cartilage regeneration and a reduction in inflammation.


### **Pharmacokinetics**

Collagen peptides are absorbed as amino acids in the small intestine.  They are distributed throughout the body, with some accumulation in skin and cartilage.  The metabolism of collagen peptides involves their breakdown into constituent amino acids, which then participate in various metabolic pathways. The elimination of the amino acid byproducts happens through normal metabolic processes, predominantly renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

2.5 to 15 grams daily, typically divided into two doses. Dosages can be as low as 2.5 grams daily to improve skin and joint health or as high as 15 grams daily to improve muscle mass and body composition.  For specific conditions such as osteoarthritis, 10 grams daily in divided doses for about 5 months has been studied. For skin and hair health, a dose of 2.5-10 grams daily for 8-12 weeks is sometimes used.  It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate dose based on individual patient needs and the intended outcome.

#### **Children:**

There is no established standard dosage for children.

#### **Special Cases:**

Due to its nutritional nature, there aren't specific dosage adjustments recommended for elderly patients, patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, or those with comorbid conditions.  However, medical guidance is still advised for these populations to ensure safety and efficacy.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Collagen peptide is a nutritional supplement and isn't typically utilized in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU. There is no recommended dosage in these scenarios.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are not typically necessary based on renal or hepatic function, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Collagen peptide is generally well-tolerated. Mild gastrointestinal discomfort like a feeling of fullness, heartburn or diarrhea, has occasionally been reported. Some people may experience an allergic reaction with symptoms like rash, itching, or swelling.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Serious side effects are rare.


### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term effects are unknown at this time, as most studies have focused on relatively short-term use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

No serious ADRs have been consistently reported.


## **Contraindications**

No absolute contraindications exist. Individuals with allergies to collagen sources (e.g., bovine, fish) should avoid those specific types of collagen peptides.



## **Drug Interactions**

No clinically significant drug interactions have been reported.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Insufficient data is available to determine safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Use with caution and consult a healthcare professional.
