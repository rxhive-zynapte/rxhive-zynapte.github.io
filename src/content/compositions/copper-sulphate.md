## **Usage**

Copper sulphate is primarily prescribed for the treatment and prevention of copper deficiency. It is also used in some regions for the treatment of phosphorus burns. While it has been used historically for other conditions like Alzheimer's disease, acne, and tooth plaque, robust scientific evidence does not support these uses.  It is important to note that copper sulphate ingestion can be toxic in high doses.

- **Pharmacological classification**:  Copper sulphate is classified as a mineral supplement.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Copper is an essential trace element vital for various physiological functions, including:
    - Erythropoiesis and leukopoiesis
    - Bone mineralization
    - Elastin and collagen cross-linking
    - Oxidative phosphorylation
    - Catecholamine metabolism
    - Melanin formation
    - Antioxidant protection

## **Alternate Names**

- Cupric sulfate
- Blue vitriol
- Roman vitriol
- Salzburg vitriol

Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and country.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Copper is a cofactor for numerous enzymes involved in critical metabolic processes, including energy production, iron metabolism, and neurotransmitter synthesis.  It plays a vital role in the formation of connective tissues, red blood cells, and melanin.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Absorption: Copper is absorbed primarily in the stomach and small intestine. Dietary factors like phytate, zinc, iron, molybdenum, calcium, and phosphorus can inhibit absorption, while proteins and organic acids can enhance it.
    - Metabolism: Absorbed copper is transported to the liver bound to albumin and incorporated into ceruloplasmin, the major copper-carrying protein in blood. Excess copper is excreted primarily in bile.
    - Elimination: The primary route of elimination is through bile into the feces. A small amount is also excreted in urine.

- **Mode of Action:** Copper acts as a catalyst in various enzymatic reactions. For example, in the formation of red blood cells, it is part of the enzyme ceruloplasmin which helps convert ferrous iron to ferric iron, a crucial step in the synthesis of hemoglobin.  Copper also aids bone mineralization, collagen and elastin cross-linking, and the crosslinking of keratin precursors.

- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Copper acts primarily as an enzyme cofactor rather than by direct receptor binding or neurotransmitter modulation.

- **Elimination pathways**:  Primarily biliary excretion, with minimal urinary excretion.


## **Dosage**

Dosage depends on the purpose (treatment or prevention of deficiency), age, and individual patient needs. 

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): 900 mcg/day.
- Maximum daily intake: 10 mg/day.

#### **Children:**

- RDA varies by age:
    - Birth to 6 months: 200 mcg/day
    - 7-12 months: 220 mcg/day
    - 1-3 years: 340 mcg/day
    - 4-8 years: 440 mcg/day
    - 9-13 years: 700 mcg/day
    - 14-18 years: 890 mcg/day


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments are not typically necessary unless underlying renal or hepatic impairment exists.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Copper can accumulate in patients with hepatic disease, so dose adjustment is necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Copper supplementation should be carefully monitored in patients with Wilson's disease or other conditions affecting copper metabolism.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of copper sulphate in the clinical settings described below (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, emergency situations) pertains specifically to intravenous administration as part of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) to prevent copper deficiency in patients who cannot obtain adequate amounts through oral intake. 

- **TPN (Adults):** 0.5-1.5 mg/day of elemental copper, added to TPN.
- **TPN (Children):** 20 mcg elemental copper/kg/day IV. May be added to TPN.
