## **Usage**

Copper is an essential trace mineral crucial for various physiological functions, including red blood cell formation, immune function, nerve function, and bone health. Copper deficiency can lead to anemia, weakened immunity, neurological problems, and skeletal abnormalities. Copper supplementation is primarily prescribed for the prevention and treatment of copper deficiency. Copper is not classified under a single pharmacological class like antibiotics or analgesics. Instead, it acts as a cofactor for numerous enzymes, influencing various metabolic pathways.

## **Alternate Names**

Copper is the standard name. There are other names depending on what salt they are in such as cupric oxide, cupric sulfate, copper amino acid chelates, and copper gluconate. Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and formulation. 

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Copper is an essential cofactor for several enzymes, including ceruloplasmin (involved in iron metabolism), cytochrome c oxidase (crucial for energy production), and superoxide dismutase (an antioxidant enzyme). It plays a vital role in iron absorption and utilization, collagen and elastin formation, and melanin synthesis.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Copper is absorbed in the stomach and small intestine. The amount absorbed is influenced by dietary factors like zinc and iron intake.
* **Distribution:** Following absorption, copper is transported to the liver bound to albumin and transcuprein. From the liver, it is distributed to other tissues via ceruloplasmin.
* **Metabolism:** Excess copper is primarily excreted in bile. A small amount is eliminated through urine.
* **Elimination:** The primary route of elimination is biliary excretion.

**Mode of Action:** Copper's mode of action involves binding to and activating copper-dependent enzymes. These enzymes participate in diverse biological processes, including energy production, antioxidant defense, neurotransmitter synthesis, and connective tissue formation. Specific mechanisms include receptor binding (e.g., copper binding to ATP7A for transport), enzyme activation (e.g., copper activating superoxide dismutase), and influencing gene expression. Elimination pathways mainly involve hepatic excretion via bile.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for adults is 900 mcg/day. For therapeutic purposes in deficiency states, oral supplementation of 2-5 mg daily is typically prescribed, not exceeding 10 mg/day. Parenteral administration (0.3-0.5 mg/day intravenously) is used in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

#### **Children:** The RDA varies with age. Infants require 200-220 mcg/day, increasing gradually to 890 mcg/day in adolescents. Pediatric dosing for deficiency is typically 20 mcg copper/kg/day intravenously.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustment is generally recommended for elderly patients. However, monitoring for potential copper toxicity is advisable with prolonged supplementation.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is necessary in patients with renal impairment as it can affect copper excretion. 
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction or avoidance may be required in severe liver disease as copper is primarily eliminated through bile.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** In specific medical conditions, copper supplementation needs to be balanced with treatment regimens to avoid adverse effects.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:**  In patients receiving TPN, copper is added to the intravenous solution.
* **Emergency Situations:** Copper is not typically administered in emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are crucial based on patient-specific factors. The dose must be altered for renal or hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders impacting copper metabolism, or potential genetic factors.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:** High doses of copper can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**  Copper toxicity can manifest as liver damage, neurological problems, and hemolytic anemia.

### **Long-Term Effects:** Long-term copper toxicity can lead to Wilson's disease-like symptoms, including hepatic cirrhosis and neurological dysfunction.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** Significant ADRs related to copper overdose warrant immediate medical attention and involve discontinuation of copper supplementation and chelation therapy if necessary.

## **Contraindications**

* **Pre-existing medical conditions:** Wilson's disease and other conditions causing copper overload.
* **Drug-specific contraindications:** No specific drug-specific contraindications exist. 
* **Genetic or metabolic disorders:** Conditions impacting copper metabolism might necessitate dose adjustments or avoidance.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **CYP450 interactions:** Copper does not significantly interact with CYP450 enzymes.
* **Common medications:** High doses of zinc can reduce copper absorption. Iron supplements and copper compete for absorption. Copper chelators (D-penicillamine, trientine) reduce copper levels.
* **OTC drugs/supplements:** Antacids can affect copper absorption.
* **Food/lifestyle:** Diets high in fructose or phytic acid can decrease copper absorption.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Copper is essential during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The RDA increases to 1000 mcg/day during pregnancy and 1300 mcg/day during lactation. It is crucial not to exceed the tolerable upper intake levels.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Cofactor for multiple enzymes, influences iron metabolism, energy production, antioxidant activity, and connective tissue synthesis.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, liver damage (in high doses).
* **Contraindications:** Wilson's disease.
* **Drug Interactions:** Zinc, iron, copper chelators.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Essential, RDA increases.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 900 mcg/day RDA, 2-5 mg therapeutic. Children: 20 mcg/kg/day.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Serum copper levels, ceruloplasmin levels.

## **Popular Combinations**

Copper is sometimes combined with zinc, manganese, and calcium in supplements for bone health.  However, caution is needed with zinc as high doses can decrease copper absorption.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Screening for pre-existing liver disease, monitoring serum copper levels during supplementation.
* **Specific Populations:** Adherence to RDA for pregnant and breastfeeding women and children.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Alcohol can impair copper absorption.
