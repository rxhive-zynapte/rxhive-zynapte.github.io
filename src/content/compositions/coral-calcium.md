## **Usage**

Coral calcium is primarily used as a calcium supplement. It's promoted for improving bone health, preventing osteoporosis, and managing conditions like hypocalcemia (low blood calcium).  It's classified as a mineral supplement, and it's not categorized as a drug with a specific pharmacological class like antibiotic or analgesic. The purported mechanism of action is to provide a source of calcium, which is essential for bone mineralization, muscle function, nerve transmission, and other physiological processes. However, evidence supporting the unique benefits of coral calcium over other forms of calcium is limited.


## **Alternate Names**

Coral calcium is also known as *Sango coral calcium* or *Algal calcium*. Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer. One example of a brand name is 21st Century.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Coral calcium acts by providing elemental calcium, which plays several crucial roles in the body:

* **Bone Health:** Calcium is a major component of bone tissue, contributing to its structure and strength.
* **Neuromuscular Function:** It's vital for nerve impulse transmission and muscle contraction.
* **Enzyme Activity:** Calcium acts as a cofactor for various enzymes.
* **Blood Coagulation:**  It's involved in the blood clotting cascade.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Calcium absorption occurs primarily in the small intestine and is influenced by factors like vitamin D, stomach acidity, and dietary components. Coral calcium's absorption rate is thought to be similar to other calcium carbonate supplements.
* **Metabolism:** Calcium doesn't undergo significant metabolism. Its levels are tightly regulated by hormones like parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin.
* **Elimination:** Calcium is mainly excreted by the kidneys, with a smaller amount lost through the intestines.


Coral calcium is not known to have specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation effects beyond the general physiological roles of calcium.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Dosages vary depending on the supplement and individual needs. Typical dosages range from 500-1500mg of elemental calcium per day, often divided into multiple doses. One brand, 21st Century, recommends four capsules daily with meals, with each capsule containing 250mg of elemental calcium. Another brand, Coral Calcium D by Pharmik Laboratories, recommends one or two 500mg tablets of elemental calcium + 200 IU of vitamin D.

#### **Children:**

Dosage in children should be determined by a pediatrician, considering age, weight, and calcium requirements.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments are usually not necessary unless there's renal impairment.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage reduction might be needed depending on the level of kidney function.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Adjustments are typically not required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual needs and potential drug interactions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Coral calcium is not typically used in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgery, mechanical ventilation, or ICU. It's generally used as a dietary supplement rather than a pharmaceutical agent for acute medical interventions.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be based on patient factors, including renal function, existing medical conditions, and potential drug interactions. Always consult with a healthcare professional before adjusting the dosage.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Constipation
* Gas
* Bloating

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Hypercalcemia (high blood calcium): can cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, confusion, and in severe cases, cardiac arrhythmias.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential long-term effects of excessive calcium intake include kidney stones and cardiovascular issues.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe hypercalcemia is a significant ADR requiring medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypercalcemia
* Severe kidney disease
* Certain medical conditions like sarcoidosis

## **Drug Interactions**

Coral calcium can interact with medications like:

* **Tetracycline antibiotics:** Reduced antibiotic absorption
* **Bisphosphonates:** Decreased bisphosphonate absorption
* **Thiazide diuretics:** May increase the risk of hypercalcemia

Also consider interactions with iron and zinc supplements and food rich in iron and zinc, which may reduce the absorption of these minerals in the body if taken at the same time as coral calcium.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Calcium is essential during pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, it's important to stay within recommended intake levels, as excessive calcium can have adverse effects. Consult with a healthcare provider for appropriate dosing guidance during these periods.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Provides supplemental calcium to support various physiological functions.
* **Side Effects:** Constipation, gas, bloating; rarely hypercalcemia.
* **Contraindications:** Hypercalcemia, severe kidney disease.
* **Drug Interactions:** Tetracycline antibiotics, bisphosphonates, thiazide diuretics, iron and zinc supplements, food rich in iron and zinc.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult a healthcare professional for dosing guidance.
* **Dosage:** Varies; consult a doctor or follow product instructions.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Serum calcium levels, especially in patients with renal impairment.

## **Popular Combinations**

Coral calcium is often combined with vitamin D to enhance calcium absorption.

## **Precautions**

General precautions include consulting a healthcare provider before using coral calcium, especially if pregnant, breastfeeding, or have underlying health conditions. Lifestyle considerations include ensuring adequate fluid intake to reduce the risk of constipation.
