      **A:**  To mitigate the risk of adrenal insufficiency, corticotropin
      therapy should be tapered gradually, especially after prolonged use.  The

## **Usage**

Corticotropin, also known as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), is prescribed for various medical conditions, including:

* **Infantile spasms (West syndrome):** This is the primary FDA-approved indication for corticotropin.
* **Multiple sclerosis (MS) exacerbations:** Corticotropin can help manage acute flare-ups in adults.
* **Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency:**  It is used to assess adrenal gland function.
* **Other conditions:** Though not always FDA-approved, corticotropin is sometimes used for nephrotic syndrome, rheumatic disorders, collagen diseases, dermatological conditions, allergic states, ophthalmic diseases, respiratory illnesses, and edematous states.

**Pharmacological classification:** Corticotropin is classified as a **corticotropin-releasing factor agonist**, meaning it mimics the action of the naturally occurring hormone corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). It's also categorized as an **endocrine drug**, a **hormone**, and more specifically, a **pituitary hormone**.

**Mechanism of action:** Corticotropin stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce and release corticosteroids, primarily cortisol (a glucocorticoid), aldosterone (a mineralocorticoid), and androgens.

## **Alternate Names**

* Corticotrophin
* ACTH
* Adrenocorticotropic hormone

**Brand names:**

* H.P. Acthar® Gel
* Purified Cortrophin® Gel


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Corticotropin exerts its effects by binding to melanocortin 2 receptors (MC2R) in the adrenal cortex, initiating a cascade of intracellular events leading to steroidogenesis. Cortisol has widespread effects, including regulation of metabolism, immune responses, and stress responses. Aldosterone regulates sodium and potassium balance, affecting blood pressure.  Androgens have various roles in development and sexual function.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Corticotropin is administered intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC). The repository gel formulation provides sustained release.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily occurs in the liver and kidneys. The natural hormone has a short half-life (around 15 minutes).
* **Elimination:** Metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine.

**Mode of Action (Cellular/Molecular):** Corticotropin binds to MC2R, activating adenylate cyclase, which increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP activates protein kinase A, leading to phosphorylation of various proteins involved in cholesterol transport and steroid hormone synthesis.

**Receptor Binding:** MC2R in the adrenal cortex.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of metabolites.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Verification of adrenal function:** 40–80 units IM/SC every 24–72 hours.
* **MS exacerbations:** 80–120 units IM/SC daily for 2–3 weeks.  Tapering may be necessary.
* **Other conditions:** 40–80 units IM/SC every 24–72 hours. Dosage is individualized based on the specific condition and patient response. Tapering is often required.

#### **Children:**

* **Infantile spasms:** 150 units/m² per day divided into two equal IM doses for 2 weeks.  A tapering schedule is essential after the initial 2 weeks. Pediatric use should be determined by a specialist, and safety needs close monitoring.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly patients:** Careful monitoring for adverse effects. Dosage adjustments might be needed.
* **Patients with renal impairment:**  No specific guidelines but dose adjustments may be considered based on clinical assessment.
