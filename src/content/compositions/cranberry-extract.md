## **Usage**

- Cranberry extract is primarily used for the prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs).  It may also help with other conditions like urinary odor, but more research is needed. It's important to note that cranberry extract is not effective for treating an active UTI; antibiotics are required for that.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Cranberry is considered a dietary supplement and doesn't fall neatly into traditional pharmacological classifications like antibiotics. However, its mechanism of action relates to its ability to prevent bacterial adhesion, giving it a preventative effect against UTIs.

## **Alternate Names**

- American cranberry, black cranberry, European cranberry, low cranberry, mossberry, *Oxycoccus macrocarpus*, trailing swamp cranberry, *Vaccinium edule*, *Vaccinium erythrocarpum*, *vaccinium macrocarpon*, *Vaccinium occycoccus*, and *Vaccinium vitis*.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Cranberry extract, specifically its proanthocyanidins (PACs), prevent the adhesion of bacteria, particularly *Escherichia coli* (E. coli), to the urinary tract walls. This hinders bacterial colonization and reduces the risk of infection.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Information about the detailed pharmacokinetics (absorption, metabolism, and elimination) of cranberry extract's active compounds, particularly PACs, is still under investigation. Current studies suggest that the absorption and metabolism of cranberry PACs is complex and can vary significantly between individuals.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- For UTI prevention: 300-400 mg of concentrated cranberry extract twice daily or 240 mL of pure unsweetened cranberry juice three times daily. Dosage of cranberry products can vary based on the concentration of proanthocyanidins. Products with at least 36 mg of proanthocyanidins or 25% are believed to be effective. 

#### **Children:**

- The safety and efficacy of cranberry supplements haven't been thoroughly established for children. While cranberry juice is generally considered safe for children, children with UTIs should be seen by a doctor and not self-treated with cranberry products. Supplements should not be given to children. Dosage considerations for children should be determined by a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically recommended for elderly patients, but individual kidney function should be considered.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised in patients with renal impairment, and dosage may need adjustment based on the severity of the impairment. 
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are usually necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Patients with diabetes should choose unsweetened cranberry products or monitor their sugar intake carefully. Patients with a history of kidney stones should consult their doctor before using cranberry products due to their oxalate content.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Cranberry extract isn't typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its primary role is in preventing UTIs, not treating acute conditions.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be needed in individuals with renal dysfunction and certain other conditions. It's important to consider the individual's overall health status when determining the appropriate cranberry dosage.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Stomach upset
- Diarrhea (especially with high doses)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Kidney stones (with high doses or in predisposed individuals)


## **Contraindications**

- History of kidney stones
- Known allergy to cranberries or aspirin (due to the presence of salicylic acid)

## **Drug Interactions**

- Warfarin: Cranberry may increase the risk of bleeding in patients taking warfarin.
- Medications metabolized by the liver (CYP2C9 substrates): Cranberry may affect the metabolism of these medications, potentially altering their effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Limited evidence suggests cranberry is generally safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding when consumed in usual dietary amounts. However, pregnant and breastfeeding women should consult their doctors before using cranberry supplements.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Prevents bacterial adhesion to the urinary tract wall, primarily *E. coli*.
- **Side Effects:** Stomach upset, diarrhea, kidney stones (rarely).
- **Contraindications:** Kidney stones, hypersensitivity to cranberries or aspirin.
- **Drug Interactions:** Warfarin, medications metabolized by the liver.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe in food amounts; consult a doctor before using supplements.
- **Dosage:** Varies based on formulation and proanthocyanidin concentration; usually 300-400 mg of extract twice daily or 240 mL of pure juice three times a day for UTI prevention. 
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for UTI symptoms and potential side effects. For patients also taking warfarin, monitor INR closely.

## **Popular Combinations**

Cranberry extract isn't typically combined with other drugs for synergistic effects in clinical practice.  Its primary use is standalone for UTI prevention.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Screen for allergies, kidney stone history, and other relevant medical conditions before recommending cranberry extract.
- **Specific Populations:** Consult a healthcare professional for individualized recommendations during pregnancy, breastfeeding, or for use in children and the elderly.
