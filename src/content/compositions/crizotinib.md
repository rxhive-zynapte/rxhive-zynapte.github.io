## **Usage**

Crizotinib is prescribed for the treatment of:

*   **Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)** that is anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive.  This is the most common use case.
*   **ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC.**
*   **Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL)** that is ALK-positive in pediatric patients and young adults (ages 1 and older). Crizotinib is used when the ALCL has not responded to other treatment or has returned.
*   **Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT)** that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) in adults and children aged 1 year and older.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Crizotinib is a kinase inhibitor, specifically an ALK and ROS1 inhibitor. It is also classified as a targeted therapy or antineoplastic agent.

**Mechanism of Action:** Crizotinib works by blocking the activity of ALK and ROS1 tyrosine kinases. These enzymes are involved in cell growth and division. In certain types of cancer, ALK and ROS1 genes are abnormal and produce too much of these tyrosine kinase enzymes, driving uncontrolled cell growth and tumor development. Crizotinib binds to and inhibits the activity of these enzymes to slow or stop cancer cell growth.


## **Alternate Names**

**International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Crizotinib

**Brand Name:** XALKORI®


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Crizotinib exerts its antineoplastic effect by inhibiting ALK and ROS1, thereby decreasing tumor cell proliferation and promoting tumor regression.  Crizotinib also inhibits c-Met, another tyrosine kinase receptor.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Crizotinib is absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations in approximately 4-6 hours. Food does not significantly affect absorption.
*   **Metabolism:**  Primarily metabolized in the liver, mainly by CYP3A4.  
*   **Elimination:** Crizotinib is primarily eliminated via the hepatic route (feces), with a small portion excreted in the urine.  The elimination half-life is approximately 42 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Crizotinib acts as a competitive ATP-binding site inhibitor of ALK and ROS1 tyrosine kinases. It binds to the ATP-binding pocket of these kinases, preventing ATP from binding and thereby inhibiting their phosphorylation activity. This disruption of downstream signaling pathways leads to reduced cell growth and proliferation in ALK-positive and ROS1-positive cancer cells.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   **NSCLC (ALK-positive, ROS1-positive) and IMT:** 250 mg orally twice daily.

#### **Children (1 year and older):**

*   **ALCL (ALK-positive):** 280 mg/m² orally twice daily (based on body surface area).
*   **IMT:** 280 mg/m² orally twice daily (based on body surface area).

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are required based solely on age.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    *   Severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min not requiring dialysis): Initially 250 mg once daily; if tolerated, may increase to 200 mg twice daily after at least 4 weeks.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
    *   Moderate hepatic impairment: 200 mg orally twice daily.
    *   Severe hepatic impairment: 250 mg orally once daily. XALKORI doses greater than 250 mg once daily have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and may result in increased exposure to potentially harmful levels.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dose modifications may be necessary depending on the specific comorbidity and its impact on drug metabolism or clearance.
