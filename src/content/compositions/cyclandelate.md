## **Usage**

Cyclandelate is a vasodilator, meaning it widens blood vessels. It was prescribed for conditions involving poor blood circulation, such as intermittent claudication (leg pain on exertion), arteriosclerosis obliterans (hardening of the arteries in the limbs), cerebrovascular insufficiency (poor blood flow to the brain), Raynaud's phenomenon (cold and numb fingers and toes), and nocturnal leg cramps. 

*Please note:* Cyclandelate's distribution was discontinued in the US by Wyeth-Ayerst in April 1997, and its efficacy for the above-mentioned indications is considered "ineffective" by the FDA. It may still be available in some regions outside the US, but its use is not generally recommended due to lack of strong evidence supporting its benefits.


## **Alternate Names**

* **Generic Name:** Cyclandelate
* **Brand Name:** Cyclospasmol (discontinued)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cyclandelate is a direct-acting vasodilator. It relaxes the smooth muscles in the blood vessel walls, leading to vasodilation.  This reduces peripheral vascular resistance and allows increased blood flow.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Information on cyclandelate's pharmacokinetics is limited. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination pathways have not been extensively studied. It is administered orally and its effectiveness is thought to be related to its effect on smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. It does not have antimicrobial properties or a specific mechanism of action against particular pathogens.

**Mode of Action:** Cyclandelate's primary action involves inhibiting calcium ion influx into vascular smooth muscle cells, reducing vascular resistance and increasing blood flow. It is also believed to have some anti-platelet aggregation effects.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Specific details on receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation by cyclandelate are not readily available in the provided sources.


## **Dosage**

Due to cyclandelate being discontinued in many regions and a lack of clear clinical evidence for its efficacy, dosage recommendations cannot be provided here. Any use of this medication should be under strict medical supervision and only where it remains available.
