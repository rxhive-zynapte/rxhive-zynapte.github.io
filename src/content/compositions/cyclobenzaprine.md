## **Usage**

- Cyclobenzaprine is prescribed for the short-term (2-3 weeks) relief of muscle spasms associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. It's used as an adjunct to rest and physical therapy, not as a sole treatment.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Skeletal muscle relaxant.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Cyclobenzaprine's precise mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it's believed to work centrally in the brainstem, rather than directly on skeletal muscle. It may depress motor activity primarily within the polysynaptic pathways of the central nervous system, potentially through enhancing the inhibitory effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

## **Alternate Names**

- International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride
- **Brand Names:** Flexeril, Amrix, Fexmid

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Cyclobenzaprine reduces tonic somatic motor activity, relieving muscle spasms. It does not affect muscle function or neuromuscular transmission.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Well-absorbed orally.
    - **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4, forming inactive metabolites.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted in urine and feces. The elimination half-life is 18 hours for immediate-release and 32 hours for extended-release formulations, prolonged in elderly patients and those with hepatic impairment.
- **Mode of Action:** Acts centrally in the brainstem, possibly by increasing GABAergic inhibition within polysynaptic pathways.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** May enhance GABAergic inhibition.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism (CYP3A4) followed by renal and fecal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Immediate-Release Tablets:** 5 mg three times a day, with or without food. The dose may be increased to 10 mg three times daily if needed. Maximum daily dose: 30 mg.
- **Extended-Release Capsules:** 15 mg once daily, swallowed whole, with or without food. The dose may be increased to 30 mg once daily if necessary. Take at the same time each day.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for patients under 15 years old.
- Adolescents (15-17 years): Same as adult dosing for immediate-release tablets. Extended-release capsules are not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose (5 mg/day) of the immediate-release formulation and titrate slowly. Consider less frequent dosing. Extended-release capsules are not recommended.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustments haven't been specifically defined, so caution is advised.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
    - Mild impairment: Start with 5 mg/day of immediate-release and titrate slowly, considering less frequent doses. Extended-release capsules are not recommended.
    - Moderate to severe impairment: Cyclobenzaprine is not recommended.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Adjust dosage cautiously based on the specific comorbidity.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Cyclobenzaprine is not indicated for these settings:

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations** (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest)

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be necessary based on patient-specific factors, including hepatic and renal function.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Drowsiness, dry mouth, dizziness, fatigue, headache.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Serotonin syndrome (agitation, hallucinations, fever, sweating, tremors), allergic reactions, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Not typically used long-term; information on chronic complications is limited.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Serotonin syndrome, angioedema, anaphylaxis.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to cyclobenzaprine.
- Concomitant use of MAOIs or within 14 days of discontinuing MAOIs.
- Acute recovery phase of myocardial infarction.
- Arrhythmias, heart block, or conduction disturbances.
- Hyperthyroidism.

## **Drug Interactions**

- MAOIs: Increased risk of serotonin syndrome.
- CNS depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids): Additive CNS depression.
- Anticholinergic drugs: Enhanced anticholinergic effects.
- CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers: May alter cyclobenzaprine metabolism.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Not established. Use only if potential benefits outweigh the risks.
- **Breastfeeding:** Excreted in breast milk; potential for adverse effects in infants. Consider alternative options or discontinue breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Believed to work centrally, potentially enhancing GABAergic inhibition.
- **Side Effects:** Drowsiness, dry mouth, dizziness; rarely serotonin syndrome, allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, MAOI use, acute MI recovery, arrhythmias, hyperthyroidism.
- **Drug Interactions:** MAOIs, CNS depressants, anticholinergics.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Safety not established; caution advised.
- **Dosage:** Refer to dosing section above.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for CNS depression, allergic reactions, and cardiovascular effects.

## **Popular Combinations**

Not commonly used in specific combinations. Prescribed primarily as monotherapy for muscle spasm relief.

## **Precautions**

- Pre-existing medical conditions: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular, hepatic, or renal disease.
- Specific Populations: See dosage section.
- Lifestyle Considerations: Avoid alcohol and activities requiring alertness.
