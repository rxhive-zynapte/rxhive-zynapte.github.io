## **Usage**

Cycloserine is an antibiotic primarily used in combination with other antituberculosis agents for the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. It is a second-line agent, meaning it is used when first-line drugs are ineffective or cannot be tolerated.  It may also be used for treating urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by susceptible strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, especially when other antibiotics have failed.

* **Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic (second-line antituberculosis agent).

* **Mechanism of Action:** Cycloserine inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by interfering with the formation of peptidoglycans.  It acts by inhibiting two enzymes, D-alanine racemase and D-alanyl-D-alanine synthetase, both of which are crucial for peptidoglycan synthesis. This weakens the bacterial cell wall, leading to cell lysis and bacterial death.



## **Alternate Names**

* **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Cycloserine
* **Brand name:** Seromycin


## **How It Works**

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Cycloserine exerts its antibacterial effect by disrupting bacterial cell wall synthesis, which is crucial for bacterial survival.

* **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    * **Absorption:** Cycloserine is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 3 to 4 hours. Food can reduce its absorption.
    * **Distribution:** It is widely distributed throughout the body, including the cerebrospinal fluid, which is important for treating tuberculosis meningitis.
    * **Metabolism:** Minimal hepatic metabolism.
    * **Elimination:** Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. The elimination half-life is about 10 hours. Renal impairment significantly prolongs the half-life.

* **Mode of Action:** Cycloserine inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by competitively inhibiting D-alanine racemase and D-alanyl-D-alanine synthetase. These enzymes are involved in the early stages of peptidoglycan synthesis.

* **Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly renal excretion (70-80% as unchanged drug). Minimal hepatic metabolism.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Tuberculosis:** Initial dose is 250 mg orally every 12 hours for 14 days, followed by 500-1000 mg/day in divided doses (every 12 hours or once daily if tolerated) for 18-24 months, not to exceed 1000 mg/day. Therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to maintain serum concentrations within the therapeutic range (15-40 mcg/mL). Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation is often given concurrently to prevent neurotoxic side effects.
* **Urinary Tract Infection:** Initial dose is 250 mg orally every 12 hours for 14 days, then 500-1000 mg/day in divided doses.  Maximum daily dose is 1000 mg.

#### **Children:**

* **Tuberculosis:**  10-20 mg/kg/day orally in divided doses, up to a maximum of 1000 mg/day for 18-24 months. Dose adjustments based on therapeutic drug monitoring are recommended.
* **Urinary Tract Infection:**  Similar to tuberculosis dosing, adjusted for weight.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage should be reduced in elderly patients with renal impairment. Start with a low dose and monitor closely.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment is crucial. Dosage frequency should be reduced based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically needed as cycloserine undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with extreme caution in patients with epilepsy, depression, anxiety, psychosis, or history of alcohol abuse due to the increased risk of central nervous system (CNS) toxicity.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Cycloserine is not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the intensive care unit (ICU). Its primary role is in the long-term treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis and, less commonly, UTIs.  It's not indicated for emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be needed in patients with renal dysfunction, based on their creatinine clearance.



## **Side Effects**

* Suicidal ideation
* Peripheral neuropathy
* Heart failure
* Hypersensitivity reactions (rash, hepatitis)


### **Long-Term Effects**

* Vitamin B6 deficiency
* Peripheral neuropathy

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

* Psychosis

* Severe depression and suicidal thoughts
* Hypersensitivity reactions



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to cycloserine
* Epilepsy

* **Isoniazid and Ethionamide:** Increased risk of neurotoxicity.
* **Other CNS Depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids):** Additive CNS depression.
* **Warfarin:**  Cycloserine may enhance the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. Monitor INR closely.
* **Ethionamide:** Increased risk of neurologic side effects.
* **Hormonal Contraceptives:** May decrease effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  C. Use only if potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:** Cycloserine passes into breast milk. Monitor breastfed infants for potential adverse effects. Vitamin B6 supplementation may be necessary for both the mother and the infant.

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis.
* **Side Effects:** CNS toxicity (headache, dizziness, drowsiness, tremor, mood changes, seizures, psychosis), hypersensitivity reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Epilepsy, severe renal insufficiency, alcohol abuse, severe psychiatric disorders.
* **Drug Interactions:** Alcohol, isoniazid, ethionamide, CNS depressants, warfarin.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category C; use with caution. Monitor breastfed infants.
* **Dosage:** 250-1000 mg/day, adjusted based on condition, renal function, and patient response.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Serum cycloserine levels, renal function, mental status, liver function tests.


## **Popular Combinations**

Cycloserine is typically used in combination with other antituberculosis agents for the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Specific combinations and dosages are determined based on the patient's resistance profile and according to established treatment guidelines.  Always consult current guidelines.
