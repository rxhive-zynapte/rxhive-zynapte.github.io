## **Usage**

Cyproterone acetate is primarily prescribed for the treatment of:

* **Prostate cancer:** It acts as an antiandrogen, reducing the effects of testosterone and inhibiting prostate cancer growth.
* **Hirsutism (excessive hair growth in women):** It helps reduce the growth of unwanted hair by blocking androgen effects.
* **Acne (severe):** In combination with ethinylestradiol, it can treat severe acne in women.
* **Hypersexuality (in men):** It can lower libido and reduce sexual urges.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antiandrogen, steroidal.

**Mechanism of Action:** Cyproterone competitively inhibits the binding of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to their receptors. This reduces the effects of these hormones, which are responsible for stimulating the growth of prostate cancer cells, promoting hair growth, and influencing sebum production in acne.

## **Alternate Names**

Cyproterone acetate (CPA) is the most common alternate name.  Androcur, Cyprostat, and Cyprone are some brand names under which cyproterone is marketed.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Cyproterone competitively blocks androgen receptors, leading to reduced androgenic effects. In prostate cancer, this inhibits tumor growth. In hirsutism and acne, it decreases hair growth and sebum production.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Cyproterone is well-absorbed orally.
* **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4.
* **Elimination:** Excreted in both urine and feces.

**Mode of Action:** Cyproterone acts as a competitive antagonist at androgen receptors. It binds to the receptors, preventing androgens from binding and exerting their effects.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Cyproterone primarily binds to androgen receptors.  At high doses, *in vitro* studies suggest potential inhibition of CYP enzymes (CYP2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4, and 2D6), and induction of CYP1A2 and CYP2E1.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
* **Prostate Cancer:** 200-300 mg daily, divided into 2-3 doses, taken orally after meals. Alternatively, 300 mg intramuscularly once a week.
* **Hirsutism:** 50-100 mg daily for 10 days per menstrual cycle (days 1-10 or 5-14), often combined with an estrogen.  Maintenance doses can be as low as 10mg daily for 10 days per month.
* **Hypersexuality:** Starting dose of 50 mg twice daily, titrated up to 100 mg twice or thrice daily.


#### **Children:**
Cyproterone is generally not recommended for use in children and adolescents, especially before puberty. In cases where it is prescribed for conditions like precocious puberty, the dose is carefully individualized under strict specialist supervision.

#### **Special Cases:**
* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustment is typically required, but caution is advised due to potential age-related decrease in hepatic and renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is recommended as 33% of the drug is excreted renally.  Dosage adjustments may be needed.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in patients with liver disease.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring required, particularly in patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Cyproterone is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.  Its primary indications are prostate cancer, hirsutism, and severe acne resistant to other therapies.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments should be made gradually to minimize side effects and maintain therapeutic efficacy. Careful titration is crucial, especially when initiating or discontinuing treatment.
