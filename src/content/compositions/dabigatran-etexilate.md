## **Usage**

Dabigatran etexilate is prescribed to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), and for the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).  It is also used for primary VTE prevention in patients undergoing elective total hip or knee replacement surgery.  Pharmacologically, dabigatran etexilate is classified as a direct thrombin inhibitor, a type of anticoagulant.  It works by directly blocking the activity of thrombin, a key enzyme in the coagulation cascade responsible for converting fibrinogen to fibrin, thereby preventing clot formation.

## **Alternate Names**

The active form of the drug, after conversion in the body, is called dabigatran. A well-known brand name for dabigatran etexilate is Pradaxa.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Dabigatran acts as a potent, competitive, reversible direct inhibitor of thrombin, both free and clot-bound.  This inhibition prevents thrombin-mediated conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, thus reducing clot formation. Dabigatran also inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Dabigatran etexilate is a prodrug rapidly converted to dabigatran after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within approximately 1-2 hours. Food can delay absorption. Dabigatran is not extensively metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and is primarily eliminated by renal excretion (approximately 80%), with a small fraction excreted in the feces. The half-life is approximately 12-17 hours in adults with normal renal function, longer in patients with renal impairment.

**Mode of Action:** Dabigatran directly binds to the active site of thrombin, preventing it from interacting with its substrates and inhibiting the coagulation cascade.

**Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly renal excretion (about 80%).

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **NVAF:** 150 mg twice daily (CrCl > 30 mL/min); 75 mg twice daily (CrCl 15-30 mL/min).
* **VTE Treatment:** 150 mg twice daily following 5-10 days of parenteral anticoagulation.
* **VTE Prophylaxis (post hip/knee replacement):** 110 mg within 1-4 hours post-op, then 220 mg once daily.

#### **Children:**

* **VTE Treatment and Prevention of recurrence**: Dosage is weight-based, divided twice daily. See detailed dosage information. 
* **8 to less than 18 years old:**  Capsules can be used if the child can swallow them whole. Consider other formulations otherwise.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Increased risk of bleeding; lower doses may be considered, especially in patients over 75 years or with impaired renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is necessary for moderate to severe renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, though dose adjustment is not usually necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized dosing based on risk factors, concomitant medications, and co-existing conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dabigatran is not typically used for intubation, surgical procedures requiring rapid anticoagulation reversal, mechanical ventilation, general ICU use, or emergency situations requiring immediate anticoagulation reversal, due to lack of rapid reversal agents. Dosage adjustments should be based on renal function.


### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dose modifications are based on renal function, age, and concomitant medication use (P-gp inhibitors).

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Bleeding (including major bleeding), gastrointestinal upset (dyspepsia, gastritis-like symptoms, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), anemia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe bleeding (intracranial, gastrointestinal), allergic reactions (angioedema).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term complications mainly relate to chronic bleeding risk.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe bleeding, angioedema, anaphylaxis.

## **Contraindications**

Active pathological bleeding, mechanical prosthetic heart valves, severe renal impairment (CrCl < 15 mL/min), hypersensitivity to dabigatran.

## **Drug Interactions**

P-gp inhibitors (e.g., amiodarone, verapamil, quinidine, dronedarone, ketoconazole) increase dabigatran levels; P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) decrease levels.  Concomitant use with other anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, heparin) or antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel) increases bleeding risk.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Category C: Dabigatran should be avoided during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.  Breastfeeding is not recommended, although very limited data suggest low excretion into breastmilk. Monitor infants for bleeding. Consider benefits/risks.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Direct thrombin inhibitor.
* **Side Effects:** Bleeding, gastrointestinal disturbances.
* **Contraindications:** Active bleeding, mechanical prosthetic heart valves, severe renal impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** P-gp inhibitors/inducers, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid in pregnancy unless clearly necessary; breastfeeding not recommended.
* **Dosage:** Variable depending on indication and renal function.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, signs of bleeding, hemoglobin/hematocrit.


## **Popular Combinations**

Dabigatran is generally not combined with other anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents long-term due to increased bleeding risk. Short-term bridging with parenteral anticoagulants during initiation or perioperative management is sometimes necessary.


## **Precautions**

Standard anticoagulation precautions apply, including careful monitoring for signs of bleeding, dose adjustment in renal impairment, and assessment of drug interactions.
