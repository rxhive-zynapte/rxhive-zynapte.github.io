## **Usage**

- Dabrafenib is prescribed for the treatment of:
    - BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma.
    - BRAF V600E mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
    - BRAF V600E mutation-positive anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC).
    - BRAF V600E mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic solid tumors in pediatric patients (≥1 year old) and low-grade glioma (LGG)  who have progressed following prior treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.

- **Pharmacological classification:** Kinase inhibitor, specifically a BRAF inhibitor.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Dabrafenib selectively inhibits BRAF kinases, particularly the mutated BRAF V600E and V600K proteins found in certain cancers. These mutated proteins promote uncontrolled cell growth and division. By inhibiting these proteins, Dabrafenib helps slow or stop cancer growth.

## **Alternate Names**

-  INN: Dabrafenib

- **Brand Name:** Tafinlar


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dabrafenib targets the mutated BRAF V600E and V600K proteins, inhibiting their kinase activity and subsequently suppressing the MAPK signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial in regulating cell growth and survival, and its dysregulation due to BRAF mutations is implicated in the development and progression of various cancers.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Oral bioavailability is approximately 95%, though delayed and reduced when taken with food (high-fat meals reduce absorption).
    - **Metabolism:**  Primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 enzymes, resulting in active metabolites (hydroxy-dabrafenib, desmethyl-dabrafenib, carboxy-dabrafenib) with similar or greater exposure and BRAF inhibitory activity compared to the parent drug.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through feces (71%), with a smaller portion excreted in urine (23%). The terminal half-life of Dabrafenib is approximately 8 hours, while its metabolites have longer half-lives (10-22 hours).

- **Mode of Action:** Dabrafenib acts as an ATP-competitive inhibitor, binding to the ATP-binding site of BRAF kinases and preventing ATP from binding. This blocks the kinase activity of BRAF, thereby disrupting the MAPK signaling cascade and halting downstream cellular processes that contribute to tumor growth.

- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Dabrafenib primarily acts through enzyme inhibition, specifically by targeting BRAF kinases.

- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4 and CYP2C8, followed by fecal elimination. Some renal excretion also occurs.
