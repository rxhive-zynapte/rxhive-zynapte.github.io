## **Usage**

- Daclatasvir is an antiviral medication specifically designed to treat chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.  It is effective against HCV genotypes 1, 3, and 4.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Direct-acting antiviral (DAA), specifically an HCV NS5A inhibitor.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Daclatasvir targets the NS5A protein of the HCV, a crucial component for viral replication and assembly. By binding to NS5A, daclatasvir disrupts these processes, effectively inhibiting viral reproduction.

## **Alternate Names**

- Daklinza (brand name)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Daclatasvir's primary effect is inhibiting HCV replication. It specifically targets the NS5A protein, which plays a key role in both RNA replication and the assembly of new viral particles (virions).  
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Daclatasvir is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1-2 hours.  Food does not significantly affect absorption.
    - **Metabolism:**  Primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 enzyme.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted mainly through the biliary route into the feces, with a small fraction eliminated through the kidneys.  The elimination half-life is approximately 12-15 hours, achieving steady-state after about 4 days of once-daily dosing.
- **Mode of Action:** Daclatasvir directly binds to the N-terminus within Domain 1 of the HCV NS5A protein. This binding interferes with the essential functions of NS5A in viral RNA replication and virion assembly.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic excretion via the biliary route into feces.  A small portion undergoes renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 60 mg orally once daily, taken with or without food.
-  Administered in combination with other antiviral agents (sofosbuvir, with or without ribavirin).
- Treatment duration: typically 12-24 weeks, depending on the HCV genotype and the presence or absence of cirrhosis.


#### **Children:**

- The safety and efficacy of daclatasvir in children younger than 18 years have not been established.  Dosage recommendations are not available for pediatric patients.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is typically needed.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is needed, even in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is recommended for patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or HBV co-infection.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Daclatasvir is not indicated for use in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its use is restricted to the treatment of chronic HCV infection.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** Reduce daclatasvir dose to 30 mg once daily when co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., atazanavir, clarithromycin, ketoconazole).
- **CYP3A4 Inducers:** Increase daclatasvir dose to 90 mg once daily when co-administered with moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil). Daclatasvir is contraindicated with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John's wort).




## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Headache
- Fatigue
- Nausea
- Diarrhea

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Severe bradycardia (especially when co-administered with amiodarone and sofosbuvir)
- Hepatitis B reactivation in patients with HBV co-infection

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Long-term side effects are not well-characterized but may include potential liver complications in patients with pre-existing cirrhosis.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Severe bradycardia requiring urgent medical attention.
- Signs of hepatic decompensation (jaundice, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy) in patients with cirrhosis.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to daclatasvir
- Concurrent use with strong CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inducers (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John's wort)
- Co-administration with sofosbuvir and amiodarone
- Pregnancy, especially when combined with ribavirin


## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** Increase daclatasvir exposure.
- **CYP3A4 Inducers:** Decrease daclatasvir exposure, potentially leading to treatment failure.
- **Amiodarone:** Increased risk of severe bradycardia when co-administered with daclatasvir and sofosbuvir.
- **Other Interactions:**  Consult a comprehensive drug interaction database for a complete list.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Contraindicated in pregnancy, particularly with ribavirin.  Highly effective contraception is necessary.
- **Breastfeeding:** Limited information available.  Not recommended when used with ribavirin.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

## **Popular Combinations**

- Sofosbuvir (with or without ribavirin)


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Screen for HBV infection, monitor liver function and cardiac rhythm (with amiodarone).
- **Specific Populations:**  Contraindicated in pregnancy (especially with ribavirin).  Not recommended during breastfeeding.
