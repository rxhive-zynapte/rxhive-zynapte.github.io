## Usage

- Dalfampridine is prescribed to improve walking in adults with multiple sclerosis (MS). This is measured by an increase in walking speed.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Potassium channel blocker.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dalfampridine blocks potassium channels on demyelinated axons, which improves nerve conduction by prolonging the action potential duration and enhancing signal transmission.

## Alternate Names

- Fampridine (specifically, 4-aminopyridine or 4-AP).  The term "dalfampridine" represents the extended-release formulation of fampridine.
- **Brand Name:** Ampyra

## How It Works

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dalfampridine improves the conduction of nerve impulses in demyelinated nerve fibers, likely by increasing the duration of action potentials.  This enhanced conduction can lead to improved muscle function and walking ability in some MS patients.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Well-absorbed after oral administration.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys.  Limited hepatic metabolism.
    - **Elimination:** Renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:**  Binds to open voltage-gated potassium channels, delaying repolarization, thereby increasing the duration of action potentials in demyelinated axons.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Blocks voltage-gated potassium channels, but doesn't directly bind to receptors, inhibit enzymes, or modulate neurotransmitters in the classical sense.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion (over 90%).

## Dosage

### Standard Dosage

#### Adults:

- 10 mg orally twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart.
- Maximum dose: 20 mg per day.  Do not exceed this limit.

#### Children:

- Safety and efficacy have not been established in children under 18 years of age.  Use is not recommended.

#### Special Cases:

- **Elderly Patients:**  Renal function should be assessed before initiating therapy, as elderly patients are more likely to have age-related renal impairment.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Contraindicated in moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤50 mL/min). Caution is advised in mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 51–80 mL/min) due to potential increased risk of seizures. Creatinine clearance should be calculated before starting treatment and monitored regularly.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific dosage adjustments recommended, as hepatic metabolism is limited.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate for seizure history. Patients with a history of seizures should not take this medication.

### Clinical Use Cases

Dalfampridine is specifically indicated for improving walking in adults with MS. Its use is not recommended in the following settings:

- **Intubation:** Not applicable.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Not applicable.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not applicable.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Not applicable.
- **Emergency Situations:** Not applicable.

### Dosage Adjustments

- Dose adjustment is primarily based on renal function.  See "Special Cases" above.

## Side Effects

### Common Side Effects:

- Urinary tract infection
- Insomnia
- Dizziness
- Headache
- Nausea
- Asthenia
- Back pain
- Balance disorder
- MS relapse
- Paresthesia
- Nasopharyngitis
- Constipation
- Dyspepsia
- Pharyngolaryngeal pain

### Rare but Serious Side Effects:

- Seizures (dose-related)
- Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis and angioedema)

### Long-Term Effects:

- Long-term effects are still being investigated, though open-label extension studies indicate a continued improvement in walking speed for up to two years.

### Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):

- Seizures, anaphylaxis.

## Contraindications

- History of seizures
- Moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤50 mL/min)
- Hypersensitivity to dalfampridine

## Drug Interactions

- **Cimetidine (and other OCT2 inhibitors):** May increase dalfampridine exposure and seizure risk.
- **Other forms of 4-aminopyridine:** Should not be used concomitantly.

## Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C
- **Fetal Risks:** Animal data suggests potential fetal harm.  Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk.
- **Breastfeeding:** Excretion into human milk is unknown. Due to the potential for adverse effects in the nursing infant, breastfeeding is not recommended while taking dalfampridine.

## Drug Profile Summary

- **Mechanism of Action:** Potassium channel blocker; improves nerve conduction in demyelinated axons.
- **Side Effects:** Urinary tract infections, insomnia, dizziness, headache, nausea, seizures (rare but serious).
- **Contraindications:** Seizures, moderate to severe renal impairment.
- **Drug Interactions:** OCT2 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine), other forms of 4-aminopyridine.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category C; not recommended.
- **Dosage:** 10 mg twice daily, not to exceed 20 mg/day. Adjust dose based on renal function.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function (creatinine clearance), monitor for seizure activity.


## Popular Combinations

- No established popular drug combinations.


## Precautions

- **General Precautions:** Assess renal function before starting therapy and monitor regularly.  Evaluate for seizure history.
- **Specific Populations:** See "Dosage - Special Cases" and "Pregnancy and Breastfeeding" above.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** No specific restrictions. Maintain a healthy lifestyle, which can benefit overall well-being in MS patients.
