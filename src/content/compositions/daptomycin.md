## **Usage**

Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) caused by susceptible Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA), and *Staphylococcus aureus* bloodstream infections (bacteremia), including right-sided infective endocarditis.  It is particularly useful against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.  However, it is not effective against pneumonia (including *S. aureus* pneumonia) as pulmonary surfactant inactivates the drug.  It is also not recommended for left-sided infective endocarditis due to *S. aureus*.  It's pharmacological classification is antibiotic.

Daptomycin's mechanism of action involves binding to bacterial cell membranes, causing rapid depolarization leading to inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, resulting in bacterial cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

While "daptomycin" is the generic name, it is marketed under brand names such as Cubicin®, Dapzura® and Cubicin RF®.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Daptomycin exerts a bactericidal effect by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane potential. This depolarization leads to the cessation of intracellular protein, DNA, and RNA synthesis, ultimately causing bacterial death. Its activity is concentration-dependent.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Daptomycin is administered intravenously, achieving near complete bioavailability.
* **Distribution:** It is highly protein-bound (around 90-93%).  It does not penetrate well into lung tissue.
* **Metabolism:**  Daptomycin is not extensively metabolized.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated renally, requiring dose adjustments in patients with renal impairment. The elimination half-life is approximately 8 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Daptomycin binds to the bacterial cell membrane in a calcium-dependent manner. This interaction creates transmembrane channels, leading to potassium efflux and membrane depolarization. The resultant disruption of ionic gradients inhibits protein, DNA, and RNA synthesis, culminating in cell death.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Daptomycin's primary mechanism involves direct interaction with the cell membrane rather than receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **cSSSI:** 4 mg/kg intravenously once every 24 hours.
* ***S. aureus* Bacteremia (including right-sided endocarditis):** 6 mg/kg intravenously once every 24 hours.
* Higher doses (up to 12 mg/kg) may be considered for severe infections under specialist guidance and with increased monitoring of CPK levels.

#### **Children (1-17 years):**

* **cSSSI:**  Dosage is based on age and weight, administered intravenously once daily:
    * 12-17 years: 5 mg/kg
    * 7-11 years: 7 mg/kg
    * 2-6 years: 9 mg/kg
    * 1 to <2 years: 10 mg/kg (infused over 60 minutes)

* Daptomycin is not recommended for children younger than 1 year old due to potential effects on the muscular, neuromuscular, and nervous systems.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with normal renal function (CrCl ≥ 30 mL/min).
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment is required. For patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 30 mL/min, including those on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, administer 4 mg/kg (cSSSI) or 6 mg/kg (*S. aureus* bloodstream infections) every 48 hours. Hemodialysis patients can alternatively be dosed three times weekly, ideally after dialysis sessions.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment is necessary for mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B).  The pharmacokinetics in severe hepatic impairment have not been evaluated.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring is recommended, especially in patients with pre-existing myopathy or those receiving concomitant medications that can cause myopathy (e.g., statins).

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Daptomycin is *not* recommended for pneumonia, left-sided endocarditis due to *S. aureus,* or other pulmonary infections as it binds to and is inactivated by pulmonary surfactant. Its use in other clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU/emergency situations should be individualized based on infection type, severity, and patient factors. Consult with an infectious disease specialist for guidance.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting
* Headache, insomnia
* Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling)
* Increased sweating

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Eosinophilic pneumonia (manifesting as fever, cough, dyspnea, and pulmonary infiltrates)
* Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis (muscle pain, weakness, elevated creatine phosphokinase [CPK])
* Peripheral neuropathy
* Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis

### **Long-Term Effects:**

* *Clostridioides difficile*-associated diarrhea (CDAD)

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

* Anaphylaxis
* Angioedema
* Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to daptomycin

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors):** Increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Close monitoring of CPK levels is required. Consider temporary discontinuation of statins during daptomycin therapy.
* **Drugs that prolong the QT interval:** Additive effects on QT prolongation. Use with caution and monitor ECG.
* **Nephrotoxic drugs:** Increased risk of renal impairment. Monitor renal function closely.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Daptomycin is Pregnancy Category B.  Animal studies have not shown evidence of fetal harm. Limited human data suggest that it can be used in pregnancy if the potential benefit outweighs the risks, especially in the second and third trimesters.
* **Breastfeeding:** Daptomycin is present in breast milk in low concentrations. While the effects on nursing infants are not fully known, the risk appears to be low due to the drug's poor oral bioavailability. Discontinuation of breastfeeding is generally recommended.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Disrupts bacterial cell membrane potential leading to cell death.
* **Side Effects:** Common: Diarrhea, headache, insomnia, injection site reactions. Serious: Eosinophilic pneumonia, myopathy/rhabdomyolysis, peripheral neuropathy, allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to daptomycin.
* **Drug Interactions:** Statins, drugs that prolong the QT interval, nephrotoxic agents.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Pregnancy Category B; generally avoid breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:**  cSSSI: 4mg/kg IV daily, *S. aureus* bacteremia: 6 mg/kg IV daily. Renal adjustments required.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** CPK (weekly, more frequent in renal impairment or with statin use), renal function, signs/symptoms of eosinophilic pneumonia and myopathy.


## **Popular Combinations**
Daptomycin is often used as monotherapy. However, combination therapy may be necessary in specific cases based on infectious disease specialist recommendations.

## **Precautions**
* **General Precautions:** Obtain baseline CPK and renal function tests. Monitor CPK levels at least weekly during therapy, and more frequently if at high risk for myopathy. Monitor renal function regularly. Monitor for signs/symptoms of eosinophilic pneumonia.
