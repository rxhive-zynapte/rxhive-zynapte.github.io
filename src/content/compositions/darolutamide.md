      What is the recommended dosage for Darolutamide?**


      **A:**  For nmCRPC and mHSPC, the standard adult dose is 600 mg orally
      twice daily with food. Dosage adjustments are necessary for moderate
      hepatic impairment and severe renal impairment (300 mg twice daily).  It
      is not recommended for use in children.

      How does Darolutamide differ from other androgen receptor inhibitors?**


      **A:** While all AR inhibitors target the androgen receptor, they have
      different chemical structures and potentially different side effect
      profiles. Darolutamide has been associated with a lower risk of certain
      side effects like seizures and cognitive impairment compared to some other
      AR inhibitors.

## **Usage**

Darolutamide is prescribed for the treatment of:

* **Non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC):**  In men at high risk of developing metastatic disease.
* **Metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC):** In combination with docetaxel.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Nonsteroidal antiandrogen, androgen receptor inhibitor.

**Mechanism of Action:** Darolutamide competitively binds to androgen receptors, inhibiting androgen binding, nuclear translocation, and ultimately, androgen receptor-mediated transcription.  This blocks the effects of androgens (like testosterone) on prostate cancer cells, inhibiting their growth and proliferation.


## **Alternate Names**

**Generic Name:** Darolutamide

**Brand Name:** Nubeqa®

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Darolutamide exerts its anti-cancer effects by directly targeting androgen receptors within prostate cancer cells. By blocking the action of androgens, darolutamide inhibits the growth and proliferation of these cells.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Darolutamide reaches maximum concentration (Cmax) approximately 4 hours after oral administration. Food increases bioavailability 2 to 2.5-fold. Absorption is saturable at higher doses.
* **Distribution:** Darolutamide crosses the blood-brain barrier.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4 to its active metabolite, ketodarolutamide.
* **Elimination:**  Primarily via feces, with a small portion excreted in urine. Elimination half-life of darolutamide is approximately 40 hours.


**Mode of Action:** Darolutamide competitively inhibits androgen binding to androgen receptors. This prevents the receptor from translocating to the nucleus and initiating androgen-dependent gene transcription, thus disrupting prostate cancer cell growth.

**Receptor Binding:** Darolutamide directly binds to the ligand-binding domain of the androgen receptor.

**Enzyme Inhibition:** Darolutamide inhibits BCRP (Breast Cancer Resistance Protein) and may weakly inhibit CYP2C9.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **nmCRPC:** 600 mg (two 300 mg tablets) orally twice daily with food.
* **mHSPC:** 600 mg (two 300 mg tablets) orally twice daily with food in combination with docetaxel (75 mg/m² IV every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles).

#### **Children:**  Use is not recommended. Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is generally necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** 
    * Mild to moderate: No dose adjustment necessary.
    * Severe (eGFR 15–29 mL/min/1.73 m²): 300 mg twice daily.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
    * Mild: No dose adjustment necessary.
    * Moderate (Child-Pugh Class B): 300 mg twice daily.
    * Severe (Child-Pugh Class C): No data available, use with caution.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, seizures, brain injury, or brain tumors.  Optimize cardiovascular risk management and monitor closely.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Darolutamide is not indicated for the clinical situations mentioned (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations). It is specifically indicated for nmCRPC and mHSPC, as outlined above.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

* **BCRP Substrates (e.g., rosuvastatin):** Darolutamide may increase BCRP substrate exposure, increasing their risk of toxicities.  Avoid coadministration or select alternative medications.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy Safety Category:** Contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Darolutamide may cause fetal harm.  Males with female partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose.
