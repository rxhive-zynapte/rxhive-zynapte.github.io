## **Usage**

- Darunavir is prescribed for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and pediatric patients 3 years of age and older, in combination with other antiretroviral agents. It is used in treatment-naive (patients never treated for HIV) and treatment-experienced individuals.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Antiretroviral, protease inhibitor.

## **Alternate Names**

- Darunavir is the generic name.
- **Brand name:** Prezista.  Prezcobix (in combination with Cobicistat).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Darunavir inhibits HIV-1 protease, an enzyme crucial for viral replication. This inhibition prevents the cleavage of viral polyproteins, resulting in the formation of immature, non-infectious viral particles. 
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Darunavir is administered orally and must be co-administered with a pharmacokinetic enhancer, either ritonavir or cobicistat, to increase its bioavailability. Darunavir is primarily metabolized by the liver (CYP3A4 enzyme system) and excreted in feces.  Ritonavir inhibits CYP3A4, significantly increasing darunavir plasma concentrations. Cobicistat also inhibits CYP3A,  boosting darunavir levels similarly to ritonavir, but cobicistat does not have antiretroviral activity itself.  Absorption is enhanced when taken with food.  Renal clearance is limited.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Treatment-naive or treatment-experienced (without darunavir resistance-associated mutations):** 800 mg darunavir with ritonavir 100 mg *or* cobicistat 150 mg once daily with food.
- **Treatment-experienced (with at least one darunavir resistance-associated mutation):** 600 mg darunavir with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily with food.

#### **Children (3 to 17 years and â‰¥10 kg):**

- Dosing is based on body weight and should not exceed the adult dose. Consult pediatric dosing tables based on weight bands and resistance status (available in sources like [2], [5]). Darunavir must be given with ritonavir and food.  Cobicistat dosing has not been established in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to potential age-related changes in organ function. Monitor closely.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is required for mild to moderate impairment. Darunavir is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment. Monitor those with chronic hepatitis B or C closely.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring recommended for patients with diabetes, hemophilia, hyperlipidemia, or a history of pancreatitis.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Darunavir is not specifically indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It is specifically for chronic HIV-1 infection management.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dose adjustments are primarily based on treatment history and darunavir resistance mutations. Renal impairment does not necessitate dose modification.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, rash.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Drug-induced hepatitis, severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), pancreatitis, new-onset or worsening diabetes, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, bleeding in hemophiliac patients, allergic reactions (angioedema).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Lipodystrophy (fat redistribution), hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular risk increase.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe skin reactions, hepatotoxicity, hypersensitivity reactions.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to darunavir.
- Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).
- Co-administration with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and having a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., alfuzosin, amiodarone, rifampin, St. John's Wort).  Consult a drug interaction checker for a comprehensive list.

## **Drug Interactions**

Numerous drug interactions exist. Consult a comprehensive drug interaction resource (e.g., [12]) for a detailed list. Significant interactions include those with:

- CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin): Reduce darunavir levels.
- CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole): Increase darunavir levels.
- Hormonal contraceptives: Reduced efficacy of hormonal contraceptives.
- Several other medications (e.g., some anticonvulsants, antifungals, antipsychotics).

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Darunavir/ritonavir is used during pregnancy when the benefits outweigh the risks.  600 mg twice daily with ritonavir 100 mg is the recommended regimen. Darunavir/cobicistat is not recommended during pregnancy.
- **Breastfeeding:** Breastfeeding is not recommended for women with HIV due to the risk of postnatal transmission. If replacement feeding is not possible, discuss alternative antiretroviral therapies with the patient.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** HIV-1 protease inhibitor.
- **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, nausea, rash; severe skin reactions, hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis.
- **Contraindications:** Severe hepatic impairment; concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers and drugs with narrow therapeutic index.
- **Drug Interactions:** Numerous (consult a drug interaction checker).
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Darunavir/ritonavir usable with caution during pregnancy; breastfeeding not recommended.
- **Dosage:**  See detailed dosage guidelines above.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests, lipid profile, blood glucose, viral load, CD4 count.

## **Popular Combinations**

Darunavir is always used in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Ritonavir or cobicistat are co-administered to boost darunavir levels. Combinations are tailored to each patient based on resistance testing.



## **Precautions**

- Pre-screen for hepatic dysfunction, diabetes, and other relevant comorbidities.
- Monitor liver function, lipids, and blood glucose during therapy.
- Counsel patients about drug interactions, including with hormonal contraceptives.
