## **Usage**

- Deca Peptide is prescribed for the treatment of Vitiligo.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Depigmenting agent.
- **Mechanism of action:** Deca Peptide stimulates the migration and proliferation of melanocytes (melanin-producing cells) in the depigmented skin patches, thereby promoting repigmentation.

## **Alternate Names**

- Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor derived Decapeptide Solution
-  Decapeptide Solution
- **Brand names:**
    - MHG Lotion
    - MeltIde
    - Melbild
    - Melgain

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Deca Peptide mimics the action of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), promoting melanocyte migration and proliferation within the vitiligo lesions, leading to repigmentation of the skin.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily topical application; systemic absorption is minimal.  Information regarding metabolism and elimination pathways is limited.
- **Mode of action:** Binds to bFGF receptors on melanocytes, stimulating their activity and migration to depigmented areas.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**  Binds to bFGF receptors. Detailed information on specific enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation is not readily available.
- **Elimination pathways:** Information regarding specific elimination pathways (renal/hepatic excretion, metabolism by CYP enzymes, etc.) is not readily available.


## **Dosage**

Deca Peptide is administered topically.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Apply a thin film of Deca Peptide solution or lotion to the clean, dry affected skin areas once daily, preferably two hours before bedtime.  Some protocols recommend morning sun exposure (10-15 minutes) or UV lamp treatment after application.

#### **Children:**

- Limited research is available on Deca Peptide use in children. Consult a pediatrician for guidance. Apply only as directed, potentially using a lower concentration depending on the child's age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution.  Consult a physician before using Deca Peptide.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustments are typically necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific dose adjustments are typically necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific dose adjustments for comorbid conditions are readily available.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Deca Peptide is primarily used in the outpatient setting for vitiligo. It is not indicated for use in scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are not typically required based on renal/hepatic function. If side effects occur (e.g., skin irritation), frequency of application may be reduced.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Skin irritation
- Dry skin
- Burning sensation at the application site
- Increased sun sensitivity of the treated skin

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

No serious side effects have been commonly reported.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term effects have not been extensively studied.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

No significant ADRs requiring immediate intervention have been reported.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to decapeptide or any components of the formulation.
- Broken, irritated, or infected skin at the application site.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Potential interactions may occur with topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors applied to the same area.
- No known significant interactions with oral medications, OTC drugs, or food.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Safety during pregnancy has not been established. Use with caution only under medical supervision if potential benefits outweigh risks.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Safety during breastfeeding has not been established. Consult a physician before use.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Stimulates melanocyte migration and proliferation, leading to repigmentation of vitiligo lesions.
- **Side Effects:** Mild skin irritation, dryness, burning sensation, photosensitivity.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.
- **Drug Interactions:** Potential interactions with other topical medications applied to the same area.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Safety not established. Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
- **Dosage:** Topical application once daily to affected area.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Observe for repigmentation and monitor any skin reactions at the application site.


## **Popular Combinations**

Deca Peptide may be used in conjunction with phototherapy (e.g., narrowband UVB, targeted phototherapy) or other topical therapies for vitiligo as per physician guidance.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Perform a patch test before applying to larger areas. Avoid contact with eyes, nose, and mouth.
- **Specific Populations:**
    - **Pregnant Women:** Consult a physician; safety not established.
    - **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Consult a physician; safety not established.
    - **Children & Elderly:** Limited data available. Use with caution under medical supervision.
