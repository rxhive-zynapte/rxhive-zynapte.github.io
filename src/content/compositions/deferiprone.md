## **Usage**

Deferiprone is an iron chelator indicated for the treatment of patients with transfusional iron overload due to thalassemia syndromes when current chelation therapy is inadequate.  It is also used for transfusional iron overload due to other chronic anemias like sickle cell disease.  It is important to remove excess iron because high levels can lead to health problems such as heart failure, liver disease, diabetes, and delayed growth in children.  Deferiprone works by binding to iron, which helps the body eliminate it through urine.

## **Alternate Names**

The active ingredient is sometimes referred to as 3-hydroxy-1,2-dimethylpyridin-4-one.  A common brand name is Ferriprox.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Deferiprone acts as an iron chelator, binding to ferric iron (Fe3+) in a 3:1 molar ratio (deferiprone:iron). This neutral complex is then excreted primarily in the urine.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Deferiprone is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma concentration achieved within 1 hour on an empty stomach. Food may decrease the rate, but not the extent of absorption.
* **Metabolism:** It is extensively metabolized in the liver, mainly through glucuronidation by the UGT1A6 enzyme, forming the inactive metabolite deferiprone 3-O-glucuronide (DFP-G). 
* **Elimination:**  More than 90% of free deferiprone is eliminated from plasma within 5-6 hours. Both deferiprone and DFP-G are primarily excreted in the urine.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Initial dose:** 25 mg/kg body weight orally three times a day (total daily dose: 75 mg/kg).
* **Maximum dose:** 33 mg/kg orally three times a day (total daily dose: 99 mg/kg).

#### **Children:**

* **Tablets (≥8 years old):** Same as adult dosing.
* **Oral Solution (≥3 years old):** Same as adult dosing, with adjustments for different formulations.
* **Children under 3 years old:** Dosage must be determined by a doctor.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly patients:**  Dose selection should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary for mild to severe impairment.  Limited data for end-stage renal disease.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is needed for mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Caution advised, with close liver enzyme monitoring. Limited information available for severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution should be exercised in patients with other medical conditions. Monitor for drug interactions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Deferiprone is not specifically indicated for use in situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its primary use remains iron chelation in chronic conditions.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be needed based on patient response, serum ferritin levels, and therapeutic goals.  If serum ferritin falls consistently below 500 mcg/L, temporary treatment interruption may be considered.

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, arthralgia, chromaturia (change in urine color), neutropenia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Agranulocytosis,  neutropenia, liver injury (increased ALT levels).


### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic complications from prolonged use are possible, including zinc deficiency and other metabolic imbalances.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Agranulocytosis requires immediate intervention.  Neutropenia can also be an ADR requiring close monitoring.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to deferiprone, history of recurrent episodes of neutropenia, history of agranulocytosis, pregnancy, breastfeeding.

## **Drug Interactions**

Avoid coadministration with other drugs known to cause neutropenia or agranulocytosis. Allow at least a 4-hour interval between deferiprone and mineral supplements or antacids containing polyvalent cations (e.g., iron, aluminum, zinc) to prevent binding and malabsorption of supplements. Avoid concomitant use of UGT1A6 inhibitors (e.g., diclofenac, probenecid, silymarin).

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Deferiprone is contraindicated during pregnancy (Pregnancy Category D) and breastfeeding.  It may cause fetal harm.  Safer alternatives should be considered.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Iron chelator, binds to ferric iron, forming a complex that is excreted in urine.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, abdominal pain, arthralgia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis.
* **Contraindications:**  Hypersensitivity, history of neutropenia/agranulocytosis, pregnancy, breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** Drugs that cause neutropenia/agranulocytosis, UGT1A6 inhibitors, polyvalent cations.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
* **Dosage:**  25-33 mg/kg three times daily, max 99 mg/kg/day. Adjust based on response and serum ferritin.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) weekly, serum ferritin every 2-3 months, liver enzymes, zinc levels.

## **Popular Combinations**

Combination therapy with deferoxamine is sometimes used when monotherapy is insufficient, or when rapid iron chelation is needed.

## **Precautions**

* Monitor ANC weekly, especially initially.
* Monitor serum ferritin, liver enzymes, and zinc levels.
* Patient education about signs of infection.
