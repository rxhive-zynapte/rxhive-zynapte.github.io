## **Usage**

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is prescribed for the treatment of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women.  Its pharmacological classification is an endogenous steroid hormone.  DHEA works by being converted into androgens and estrogens in the body. In the case of vaginal atrophy, the local conversion to estrogens helps to revitalize vaginal tissues.

## **Alternate Names**

Dehydroepiandrosterone is also known as DHEA-S (Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate), prasterone (specifically for intravaginal use), 3β-hydroxyandrost-5-en-17-one, 3β-hydroxy-5-androsten-17-one, and androstenolone. Intrarosa is a popular brand name for the intravaginal form of DHEA.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** DHEA is a precursor hormone that is converted into androgens and estrogens in peripheral tissues. The specific effects of DHEA depend on the type and amount of sex hormones produced by the conversion process. For instance, in vaginal atrophy, DHEA applied locally is primarily converted to estrogens, which improve vaginal tissue health.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Orally administered DHEA is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  Intravaginally administered DHEA is absorbed locally into vaginal tissues.
* **Metabolism:** DHEA is rapidly metabolized in the liver and other peripheral tissues. It is converted to DHEA-S, which is further metabolized into androgens like testosterone and androstenedione, and estrogens like estrone and estradiol.
* **Elimination:** DHEA and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine.

**Mode of Action:** DHEA does not directly bind to receptors.  Its mode of action involves its conversion to active sex hormones, which then exert their effects by binding to estrogen and androgen receptors.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** DHEA itself does not bind to receptors or inhibit enzymes. However, its downstream metabolites (androgens and estrogens) bind to their respective receptors, which in turn modulate cellular processes.

**Elimination Pathways:** DHEA and its metabolites are conjugated in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine. A small amount may be excreted in the bile.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

For vaginal atrophy, the standard dose of intravaginal prasterone (DHEA) is 6.5 mg once daily at bedtime.


#### **Children:**

DHEA is not recommended for use in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  For vaginal atrophy, the standard adult dose is used.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be needed based on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments may be needed based on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution should be exercised in patients with hormone-sensitive cancers, hyperandrogenism, high cholesterol, heart disease, and mood disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

DHEA is not indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Acne, oily skin, hirsutism (unwanted hair growth in women), deepening of the voice in women, vaginal discharge (with intravaginal use).


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Elevated liver enzymes, mania in patients with mood disorders, unfavorable changes in cholesterol levels.


### **Long-Term Effects**

The long-term effects of DHEA use are not fully understood.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Rare but serious ADRs include severe acne, liver toxicity, and mania.



## **Contraindications**

DHEA is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected hormone-sensitive cancers (breast, ovarian, prostate), pregnancy, and breastfeeding. It should be used with caution in patients with hyperandrogenism, liver disease, diabetes, high cholesterol, and mood disorders.

## **Drug Interactions**

DHEA may interact with antipsychotics, carbamazepine, estrogen, lithium, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, testosterone, triazolam, valproic acid, anticoagulants, antidepressants, aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen, fulvestrant, and bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine.

* **Dosage:** Intravaginal: 6.5 mg once daily.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor hormone levels, cholesterol levels, and liver function tests.


## **Popular Combinations**

DHEA is not typically used in combination with other drugs for vaginal atrophy.

## **Precautions**

Screen patients for hormone-sensitive cancers and other contraindications before initiating therapy. Monitor for side effects. Caution in patients with liver disease, diabetes, high cholesterol, and mood disorders.
