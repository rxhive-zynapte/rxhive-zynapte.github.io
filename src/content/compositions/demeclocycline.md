## **Usage**

Demeclocycline is an antibiotic belonging to the tetracycline class. It is prescribed for the treatment of various bacterial infections caused by susceptible organisms, including:

* **Respiratory tract infections:** Pneumonia, bronchitis
* **Urinary tract infections**
* **Skin and soft tissue infections**
* **Sexually transmitted infections (STIs):** Syphilis, gonorrhea (though no longer a preferred treatment), chancroid, granuloma inguinale, lymphogranuloma venereum
* **Other infections:** Brucellosis (in combination with streptomycin), plague, cholera, tularemia, relapsing fever, Q fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever, psittacosis, melioidosis, glanders, yaws, actinomycosis, gas gangrene, tetanus, acute intestinal amebiasis, severe acne vulgaris (as adjunctive therapy)

Demeclocycline's pharmacological classification is **antibiotic**.

**Mechanism of Action:** Demeclocycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly binding to the 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits, preventing aminoacyl-tRNA from binding to the A site of the ribosome.

Additionally, demeclocycline is used off-label to treat **syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)**, a condition characterized by excessive water retention.  This is due to its ability to induce reversible nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.


## **Alternate Names**

* **Generic Name:** Demeclocycline hydrochloride
* **Brand Name:** Declomycin

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Demeclocycline exerts its bacteriostatic effect by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis.  It does not directly kill bacteria but prevents their growth and replication, allowing the body's immune system to eliminate the infection.  In SIADH, Demeclocycline antagonizes the antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in the renal tubules, promoting water excretion and correcting hyponatremia.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Demeclocycline is absorbed orally, but its absorption is reduced by food, milk, and dairy products, antacids containing aluminum, magnesium, or calcium, iron supplements and multivitamins with iron, as well as laxatives with magnesium
* **Distribution:** It is widely distributed throughout the body, crossing the placental barrier and entering breast milk.
* **Metabolism:** Demeclocycline undergoes partial hepatic metabolism.
* **Elimination:** It is primarily excreted in the urine and feces, with a half-life of 10-17 hours.  It is not significantly removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

**Mode of Action:**  Demeclocycline passively diffuses through bacterial cell membranes, binding to the 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits to prevent protein synthesis.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Demeclocycline primarily targets bacterial ribosomes. In SIADH treatment, it antagonizes ADH action in the renal tubules.

**Elimination Pathways:** Renal and fecal excretion, with partial hepatic metabolism.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Bacterial Infections:** 150 mg orally every 6 hours or 300 mg orally every 12 hours.  For primary atypical pneumonia, 900 mg/day in 3 divided doses for 6 days may be used.
* **SIADH (Off-label):** Initial dose: 600-1200 mg/day orally in 3 or 4 divided doses. Maintenance dose: 600-900 mg/day orally or the lowest effective dose.



#### **Children:**

* **Bacterial Infections:**  Children older than 8 years: 7-13 mg/kg/day orally divided into 2-4 doses (maximum dose: 600 mg/day). Demeclocycline is generally avoided in children younger than 8 years due to the risk of tooth discoloration and enamel hypoplasia.



#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to the risk of increased drug levels from decreased renal clearance. Dose adjustments might be necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce dose and/or prolong dosing interval.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Reduce dose and/or prolong dosing interval.  Use with caution as demeclocycline can cause hepatotoxicity.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), myasthenia gravis, diabetes insipidus, and esophageal irritation.





### **Clinical Use Cases**

Demeclocycline's use in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations is limited as other antibiotic options are generally preferred. Demeclocycline does not have specific dosage recommendations for these situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments based on renal/hepatic dysfunction are described above.  No specific guidelines are available for metabolic disorders or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.

## **Drug Interactions**

Demeclocycline interacts with numerous medications.  Some key interactions include:

* **Antacids, iron supplements, calcium supplements, magnesium-containing laxatives:** Reduced absorption of demeclocycline
* **Oral contraceptives:** Decreased effectiveness of birth control pills
* **Warfarin and other anticoagulants:** Altered anticoagulant effect
* **Retinoids (e.g., isotretinoin, acitretin):** Increased risk of intracranial hypertension
* **Methoxyflurane:** Increased risk of nephrotoxicity
* **Cyclosporine:** Increased risk of hepatotoxicity
* **Rifampicin:** Decreased effectiveness of demeclocycline

Refer to a comprehensive drug interaction resource for a complete list of potential interactions.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Demeclocycline is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of fetal harm, including tooth discoloration, enamel hypoplasia, and skeletal abnormalities.

* **Breastfeeding:** Demeclocycline passes into breast milk and may affect bone and tooth development in the nursing infant. It is generally recommended to avoid demeclocycline during breastfeeding. For short-term use, monitor the infant for side effects like rash, diarrhea, or thrush.
