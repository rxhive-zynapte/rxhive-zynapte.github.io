      What is the difference between Desidustat's use in dialysis and

      **A:** The main difference lies in the starting dose for ESA-experienced
      patients.  Non-dialysis ESA-experienced patients start at 100 mg while
      those on dialysis have a starting dose determined by previous ESA dosage
      (100mg, 125mg, or 150mg).  ESA-naive patients, both dialysis and
      non-dialysis, start with 100 mg.  In patients on dialysis, the medication
      is taken after the dialysis session.

## **Usage**

- Desidustat is prescribed for the treatment of anemia in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), both on dialysis and not on dialysis.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH) inhibitor.  Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Desidustat inhibits HIF-PH, leading to the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs).  This results in increased production of erythropoietin (EPO), improved iron metabolism, and ultimately, enhanced erythropoiesis (red blood cell production).

## **Alternate Names**

- Oxemia™
- Rytstat

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Desidustat increases hemoglobin levels by stimulating erythropoietin production. It also improves iron utilization.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Administered orally. Peak plasma concentration is reached in a dose-dependent manner. It doesn't show significant drug accumulation after multiple doses. Mean elimination half-life ranges from 6 to 14 hours.  Not a substrate of P-gp or BCRP at gastrointestinal pH 5.5. No significant interaction with transporters such as OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, and OCT2 at clinically relevant doses. Shows interaction with OAT3 with IC50 of 1.7 μM.
- **Mode of Action:** Binds to and inhibits prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymes, which normally degrade HIF-α. By inhibiting PHD, Desidustat allows HIF-α to accumulate and dimerize with HIF-β, translocate to the nucleus, and initiate transcription of genes involved in erythropoiesis, iron metabolism, and angiogenesis.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Renal and Hepatic

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Non-Dialysis Patients:** Starting dose is 100 mg orally three times a week (e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday, or Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, two days apart, not four days apart).

    - **ESA-experienced:** 100 mg, 125 mg, or 150 mg orally three times a week, depending on prior ESA dose.
    - It is recommended that desidustat is to be taken after completion of the dialysis session.
