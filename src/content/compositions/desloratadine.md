## **Usage**

Desloratadine is prescribed for the relief of symptoms associated with:

* **Seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever):**  Sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose/throat/eyes, and watery eyes.
* **Perennial allergic rhinitis (year-round allergies):** Similar symptoms to seasonal allergies but occurring throughout the year.
* **Chronic idiopathic urticaria (hives):**  Itchy, raised welts on the skin.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Desloratadine is a second-generation antihistamine, specifically an H<sub>1</sub>-receptor antagonist.

**Mechanism of Action:** Desloratadine works by selectively blocking the peripheral histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors.  This inhibits the actions of histamine, a chemical mediator released during allergic reactions, reducing the associated symptoms.  It is considered "non-sedating" because it does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.


## **Alternate Names**

Desloratadine is the generic name.  

**Brand Names:**  Aerius, Clarinex, Clarinex RediTabs, and various generic formulations.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Desloratadine effectively antagonizes the effects of histamine at peripheral H<sub>1</sub> receptors, mitigating the symptoms of allergic reactions.  It exhibits minimal anticholinergic and sedative properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Desloratadine is well absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in approximately 3 hours.  Food intake may slightly delay absorption, but it does not affect overall bioavailability.
* **Metabolism:** Desloratadine is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4. It is metabolized to its active metabolite 3-hydroxydesloratadine.
* **Elimination:** Desloratadine and its metabolites are eliminated through both renal and hepatic pathways.  The elimination half-life is approximately 27 hours, which allows for once-daily dosing.

**Mode of Action:** Desloratadine competitively binds to peripheral H<sub>1</sub> receptors, preventing histamine from binding and triggering the downstream signaling cascade responsible for allergic symptoms.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Desloratadine selectively targets H<sub>1</sub> receptors. Its metabolism involves CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults and Adolescents (12 years and older):** 5 mg orally once daily.

#### **Children:**

* **6 to 11 years:** 2.5 mg orally once daily.
* **1 to 5 years:** 1.25 mg orally once daily.
* **6 to 11 months:** 1 mg orally once daily.
* **Under 6 months:** Use is not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Start with a lower dose (2.5 mg) and adjust as needed based on tolerability and clinical response.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  A starting dose of 5 mg every other day is recommended.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** A starting dose of 5 mg every other day is recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is advised, and dose adjustments may be necessary depending on the specific comorbidity.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Desloratadine is not typically indicated for use in acute clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  It primarily manages chronic allergic conditions.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dose adjustments may be required based on age, renal function, and hepatic function as outlined above. Genetic polymorphisms affecting CYP2D6 activity can influence desloratadine metabolism, but routine genetic testing is not typically recommended.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Fatigue
* Dry mouth
* Headache
* Pharyngitis
* Myalgia


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Seizures (rare, especially in children)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

No significant long-term adverse effects have been reported with desloratadine use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) are rare but require immediate medical intervention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to desloratadine or loratadine.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 Inhibitors:**  Ketoconazole, erythromycin, azithromycin, fluoxetine, and cimetidine may increase desloratadine plasma concentrations.  Monitor closely and consider dosage adjustments.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Desloratadine is classified as Pregnancy Category C.  Use only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:** Desloratadine is excreted in breast milk.  Weigh the benefits of breastfeeding against the potential risk to the infant. Consider using an alternative medication or temporarily discontinuing breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Selective peripheral H<sub>1</sub>-receptor antagonist.
* **Side Effects:** Fatigue, dry mouth, headache, pharyngitis, myalgia.  Rarely, allergic reactions and seizures.
* **Contraindications:**  Hypersensitivity to desloratadine or loratadine.
* **Drug Interactions:**  CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin).
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution. Category C.  Excreted in breast milk.
* **Dosage:** Adults and adolescents: 5 mg once daily. Children: Dose varies by age (see above).
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for efficacy and adverse events, especially allergic reactions.


## **Popular Combinations**

Desloratadine is often used as monotherapy. However, it can be combined with intranasal corticosteroids for more comprehensive management of allergic rhinitis when symptoms are not adequately controlled with desloratadine alone.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess for any history of hypersensitivity reactions.
* **Specific Populations:** Caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, history of seizures (especially children), pregnant or breastfeeding women.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Although considered non-sedating, some individuals may experience mild drowsiness.  Advise patients to avoid operating machinery or driving until they know how the medication affects them.
