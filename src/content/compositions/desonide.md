## **Usage**

Desonide is a low-potency topical corticosteroid indicated for the relief of inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.  These include conditions like atopic dermatitis (eczema), allergic contact dermatitis, psoriasis, and seborrheic dermatitis. It is classified as a corticosteroid. Desonide works by mimicking the effects of cortisol, a naturally occurring hormone produced by the adrenal glands, thereby reducing inflammation, itching, and redness in the skin.

## **Alternate Names**

Desonide is also known by its various brand names such as Desonate, DesOwen, LoKara, Tridesilon, and Verdeso. There are no widely recognized international or regional variations of the generic name "Desonide".


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Desonide exerts its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm of target cells within the skin. This binding leads to the modulation of gene expression and ultimately reduces the production of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and cytokines. Consequently, it suppresses the migration of neutrophils and macrophages to the inflamed site, thereby reducing inflammation and its associated symptoms.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Topical application of desonide results in minimal systemic absorption. When absorbed, it is metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted through the kidneys. The elimination half-life is relatively short. CYP enzyme interactions have not been extensively documented.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a thin layer of desonide cream, ointment, or lotion to the affected skin area two to three times daily, depending on the severity of the condition. If using the gel formulation, apply twice daily.

#### **Children:**

For children aged 3 months and older, apply a thin layer of desonide cream, ointment, or lotion to the affected skin area two times a day. For the gel and foam, the dosage is also twice daily. For children under 3 months of age, desonide use should be determined and closely monitored by a doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Similar to adults, but monitor for increased skin thinning due to age-related skin changes. Limit treatment duration as much as possible.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically necessary due to minimal systemic absorption.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No dosage adjustment is typically necessary due to minimal systemic absorption.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised in patients with diabetes or Cushing's syndrome, as topical corticosteroids can potentially exacerbate these conditions due to systemic absorption, albeit minimal.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Desonide is *not* indicated for use in situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) use, or emergency situations. It's strictly for topical dermatological use.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific dosage adjustments are usually necessary based on patient factors, as systemic absorption is minimal. However, always consider the patient's age, the severity of the dermatosis, and potential drug interactions.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Burning, stinging, itching, dryness, irritation, and redness at the application site may occur, especially in the initial days of treatment.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Skin atrophy, telangiectasias, hypopigmentation, hypertrichosis, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, and secondary infections.  With prolonged or extensive use, HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, and hyperglycemia are possible.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Skin thinning, striae, and changes in skin pigmentation.  

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, skin infections, adrenal suppression.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to desonide or any of the components of the formulation.

## **Drug Interactions**

Clinically significant drug interactions are rare due to minimal systemic absorption. However, concomitant use of other topical medications on the same area should be discussed with a physician.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Desonide is classified as Pregnancy Category C. Use during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.  It's unknown if desonide is excreted in breast milk. Consult with a doctor before using it while breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Binds to glucocorticoid receptors, modulating gene expression, and reducing inflammation.
* **Side Effects:** Local skin reactions (burning, itching, dryness), rarely skin atrophy, HPA axis suppression with extensive use.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:** Minimal.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category C; use with caution.
* **Dosage:** Apply thinly 2-3 times/day (cream/ointment/lotion), 2 times/day (gel).
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor the treated skin area for adverse effects and treatment response. Periodically assess for signs of systemic absorption if used extensively or for prolonged periods.

## **Popular Combinations**

Desonide is not typically used in combination with other drugs. However, emollients can be used concomitantly to manage skin dryness.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Avoid contact with eyes. Use the minimum quantity for the shortest duration necessary.
* **Specific Populations:**  Use with caution in children and the elderly.  Avoid use in infants under 3 months old without close medical supervision.
* **Pregnant Women:** Use only if clearly needed and under medical supervision.
* **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Consult a physician before use.
* **Children & Elderly:** Monitor closely for adverse reactions.
* **Menstruating Individuals:** No specific precautions.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** No specific considerations related to lifestyle.
