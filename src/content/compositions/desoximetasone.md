## **Usage**

Desoximetasone is a potent topical corticosteroid prescribed for the relief of inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.  It is classified as a glucocorticoid, a type of corticosteroid with potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects.  Desoximetasone works by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the skin, which leads to decreased production of inflammatory mediators and suppression of the immune response. This reduces skin inflammation, itching, and redness.

## **Alternate Names**

Desoximetasone is the generic name.  Brand names include Topicort®, Topicort® LP, Desoxi®, Taro-Desoximetasone®, and Topicort® Mild.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Desoximetasone exerts its effects through binding to glucocorticoid receptors within skin cells. This binding initiates a cascade of intracellular events that lead to the suppression of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and cytokines. Additionally, it inhibits the proliferation and migration of inflammatory cells to the site of application.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Topical application results in minimal systemic absorption when applied to intact skin. Occlusive dressings, application to large surface areas, or prolonged use can increase absorption.  Desoximetasone is metabolized primarily in the skin and the remainder systemically, mainly by the liver, and excreted via renal and fecal routes. Information on its half-life is limited.

**Mode of Action:** Desoximetasone binds to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors. The drug-receptor complex translocates to the nucleus, modulating the transcription of genes involved in the inflammatory response.  This leads to reduced production of inflammatory mediators and diminished immune cell activity.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** The primary mechanism of action is through glucocorticoid receptor binding.  While some impact on enzyme systems is possible, it is not the primary mode of action. No direct effect on neurotransmitter modulation is known.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily metabolized in the skin, with the remainder metabolized systemically, mostly by the liver. Excretion is through both renal and fecal routes.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a thin film to the affected area twice daily. Gently rub into the skin. Do not use for more than 4 weeks.

#### **Children:**

Use and dose must be determined by a doctor. Children are more susceptible to systemic side effects and should be monitored closely by their doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Similar to adults, but may require closer monitoring due to age-related decline in organ function.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised, though dose adjustment may not be needed due to primarily cutaneous metabolism. Monitor for systemic side effects.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, though dose adjustment may not be needed due to mainly skin metabolism. Monitor for systemic side effects.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider the patient's overall health and other medical conditions, especially diabetes, when prescribing.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Desoximetasone is not typically indicated for the clinical scenarios mentioned (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, emergency situations). Its use is primarily limited to topical dermatological conditions.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments should be based on individual patient response, condition severity, and potential for drug interactions or systemic absorption.  Consider renal or hepatic impairment and other medical conditions when adjusting the dose.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, adrenal suppression, blurred vision, chorioretinopathy.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Skin atrophy, telangiectasias, striae, and potentially HPA axis suppression with prolonged or excessive use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, skin infections, and systemic effects from increased absorption.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to desoximetasone or any component of the formulation.  Untreated skin infections (bacterial, viral, fungal).


## **Drug Interactions**

Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (e.g., ritonavir, itraconazole) can increase systemic exposure to corticosteroids. No known clinically significant interactions with commonly prescribed medications, OTC drugs, or supplements have been specifically reported with topical application. However, always consider the possibility of interactions based on the patient's specific medication profile.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (FDA classification no longer used).  Topical corticosteroids should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time. Animal studies have shown teratogenicity at high doses. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.

**Breastfeeding:** It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk. Caution should be exercised.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Binds to glucocorticoid receptors, reducing inflammation and suppressing immune response in the skin.

* **Side Effects:** Burning, itching, irritation, dryness (common); skin atrophy, striae, adrenal suppression (serious).

* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, untreated skin infections.

* **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase systemic exposure.

* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution. Not for extensive or prolonged use during pregnancy.

* **Dosage:** Apply a thin film twice daily, not to exceed 4 weeks.

* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Skin condition, signs of local or systemic side effects, growth in children.


## **Popular Combinations**

No specific "popular combinations" exist for desoximetasone. Topical corticosteroids are sometimes used in conjunction with other topical medications to treat specific dermatological conditions.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Avoid contact with eyes, mucous membranes, open wounds. Discontinue use if irritation or sensitization develops.

* **Specific Populations (Pregnant Women, Breastfeeding Mothers, Children & Elderly):** See respective sections.

* **Lifestyle Considerations:** No specific lifestyle considerations, except general skin care and hygiene practices.
