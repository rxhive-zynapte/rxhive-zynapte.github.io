## **Usage**

Desvenlafaxine is prescribed for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in adults.  It is classified as a Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressant. Its mechanism of action involves inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft, thereby increasing the concentration of these neurotransmitters in the brain, which are believed to play a crucial role in regulating mood.

## **Alternate Names**

Desvenlafaxine is the generic name. Brand names include Pristiq and Khedezla.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Desvenlafaxine primarily exerts its antidepressant effect by increasing the synaptic concentrations of serotonin and norepinephrine, resulting in enhanced neurotransmission. This is achieved through inhibition of the serotonin transporter (SERT) and the norepinephrine transporter (NET).

**Pharmacokinetics:** Desvenlafaxine is well-absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within approximately 5 hours. It undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6, to form the inactive metabolite O-desmethylvenlafaxine.  Elimination occurs mainly through renal excretion, with a half-life of about 11 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Desvenlafaxine binds to and inhibits SERT and NET, preventing the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine from the synaptic cleft. This leads to increased levels of these neurotransmitters available to bind to postsynaptic receptors.

**Elimination Pathways:** Desvenlafaxine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 in the liver.  The resulting metabolites are then excreted mainly through the kidneys.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The recommended starting and therapeutic dose is 50 mg orally once daily, with or without food.  Dosages up to 400 mg/day have been studied, but no additional benefit has been demonstrated beyond 50 mg/day, while side effects are increased at higher doses.

#### **Children:**

The safety and effectiveness of desvenlafaxine have not been established in pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  While no specific dosage adjustments are recommended for elderly patients solely based on age, caution is advised due to potential age-related changes in drug clearance and increased sensitivity to side effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    * Mild (CrCl â‰¥50 mL/min): No dosage adjustment necessary.
    * Moderate (CrCl 30-50 mL/min):  Not to exceed 50 mg/day.
    * Severe (CrCl <30 mL/min) and ESRD requiring hemodialysis: Not to exceed 25 mg once daily or 50 mg every other day. No supplemental dose after hemodialysis.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
    * Moderate to severe (Child-Pugh score 7-15): 50 mg orally once daily. Dosages >100 mg/day are not recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised in patients with pre-existing hypertension, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, seizures, glaucoma, bipolar disorder, and bleeding disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Desvenlafaxine is not indicated for use in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest. Its sole indication is for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient response and tolerability. Gradual dose reduction is recommended when discontinuing desvenlafaxine to minimize potential withdrawal symptoms.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, headache, dizziness, insomnia, dry mouth, constipation, decreased appetite, sweating, fatigue.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Serotonin syndrome, suicidal thoughts or actions (particularly in young adults), increased blood pressure, abnormal bleeding, hyponatremia, angle-closure glaucoma, mania/hypomania, seizures, interstitial lung disease, allergic reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Sexual dysfunction, weight gain.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Serotonin syndrome, severe allergic reactions, suicidal ideation, hypertensive crisis.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to desvenlafaxine or venlafaxine.
* Concurrent or recent (within 14 days) use of MAOIs.
* Concurrent use of methylene blue or linezolid.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **MAOIs:**  Risk of serotonin syndrome.
* **Serotonergic Drugs:** Increased risk of serotonin syndrome.
* **Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis:** Increased risk of bleeding (e.g., NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin).
* **CYP2D6 Inhibitors/Inducers:** May affect desvenlafaxine metabolism.
* **Alcohol:** May potentiate sedative effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Desvenlafaxine is classified as Pregnancy Category C.  It should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Neonatal withdrawal symptoms have been reported. Desvenlafaxine is excreted in breast milk.  Caution is advised when administering to breastfeeding mothers.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** SNRI, inhibits reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine.
* **Side Effects:**  Nausea, headache, insomnia, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, sexual dysfunction, serotonin syndrome, suicidal ideation.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, concurrent MAOI use.
* **Drug Interactions:** MAOIs, serotonergic drugs, anticoagulants.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution; potential fetal/neonatal risks.
* **Dosage:** 50 mg/day, adjust based on individual response and renal/hepatic function.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, mood changes, suicidal ideation.


## **Popular Combinations**

No routinely recommended or "popular" drug combinations exist for desvenlafaxine.  Combination therapy is generally considered only after an adequate trial of monotherapy has failed.


## **Precautions**

Monitor blood pressure, especially in patients with pre-existing hypertension. Screen for suicidal ideation, especially in young adults. Monitor for serotonin syndrome. Assess for potential drug interactions. Use with caution in patients with glaucoma, seizures, bleeding disorders, or bipolar disorder. Advise patients against abrupt discontinuation.  Caution with alcohol consumption.  Caution in operating machinery.
