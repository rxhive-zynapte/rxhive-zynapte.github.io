      dexamethasone to the surface of the eye. The implant is used for specific
      conditions like macular edema and uveitis, while eye drops are typically
      used for more superficial ocular inflammation.

## **Usage**

Dexamethasone intravitreal implant is a corticosteroid indicated for the treatment of macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) or central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye, and diabetic macular edema in patients who are pseudophakic or who are phakic and scheduled for cataract surgery.  It belongs to the pharmacological class of corticosteroids, specifically glucocorticoids. The mechanism of action involves suppressing inflammation by inhibiting multiple inflammatory cytokines, resulting in decreased edema, fibrin deposition, capillary leakage, and migration of inflammatory cells.

## **Alternate Names**

The International Nonproprietary Name (INN) is dexamethasone.  A commonly used brand name is Ozurdex®.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Dexamethasone, a potent corticosteroid, exerts its effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm. This complex then translocates to the nucleus, modulating gene expression and ultimately suppressing inflammation. It inhibits multiple inflammatory cytokines, leading to decreased edema, fibrin deposition, capillary leakage, and migration of inflammatory cells.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The dexamethasone intravitreal implant is administered via intravitreal injection. The implant is biodegradable and slowly releases dexamethasone into the vitreous humor. Systemic absorption is minimal.  Elimination pathways have not been fully characterized for the intravitreal implant, however, systemically administered dexamethasone is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys.  Specific details on the metabolism by CYP enzymes are not available for the intravitreal formulation.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard dose is one Ozurdex® implant (0.7 mg dexamethasone) administered via intravitreal injection into the affected eye. Repeat administration should be considered approximately every 6 months if the patient experiences a recurrence of symptoms and, in the physician's judgment, may benefit without being exposed to a significant risk.

#### **Children:**

Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients.  Ozurdex® is not recommended for pediatric use.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with glaucoma, a history of ocular herpes simplex, or those taking anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosage recommendations for specific clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not applicable as this is a locally administered intravitreal implant designed specifically for ophthalmic conditions.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific dosage adjustments are necessary based on renal or hepatic function, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms as systemic exposure following intravitreal administration is minimal.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Increased intraocular pressure, conjunctival hemorrhage, cataract, eye pain, vitreous detachment, headache, ocular hypertension.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, implant migration to the anterior chamber (especially in patients with a compromised posterior lens capsule).

### **Long-Term Effects**

Cataract formation or progression, glaucoma.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe increase in intraocular pressure requiring surgery, retinal tears or detachments, endophthalmitis.

## **Contraindications**

Ocular or periocular infection, advanced glaucoma, non-intact posterior lens capsule (aphakia with rupture, ACIOL with rupture, etc.), hypersensitivity to any component of the product.

## **Drug Interactions**

No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted; however, caution should be exercised in patients taking anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications due to an increased risk of conjunctival or vitreous hemorrhage.  Concomitant use of other ophthalmic medications should be discussed with the ophthalmologist.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category: C.  Ozurdex® is not recommended during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  There are limited data on the use in breastfeeding; systemic absorption is low, but caution should be exercised. It is unknown if dexamethasone from the intravitreal implant is present in human milk.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Suppresses inflammation by inhibiting multiple inflammatory cytokines.
* **Side Effects:** Increased intraocular pressure, conjunctival hemorrhage, cataract, eye pain.
* **Contraindications:** Active eye infection, advanced glaucoma, non-intact posterior lens capsule.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Use with caution in patients taking anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Not recommended unless potential benefit outweighs risk.
* **Dosage:** 0.7 mg intravitreal implant every 6 months (approximately) as needed.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Intraocular pressure, visual acuity, cataract development.


## **Popular Combinations**

Data on popular drug combinations specifically with Ozurdex® is limited.  Concomitant use of other ophthalmic medications for glaucoma or other ocular conditions may be necessary. The decision to use concomitant medications rests with the treating ophthalmologist.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Monitor for increased intraocular pressure and signs of infection.
* **Specific Populations:**
    * **Pregnant Women:** Not recommended.
    * **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Exercise caution.
    * **Children & Elderly:** Not recommended for pediatric use. No dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Patients may experience temporarily blurred vision after the injection and should avoid driving or operating machinery until vision clears.
