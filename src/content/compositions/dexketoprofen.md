## **Usage**

- Dexketoprofen is prescribed for the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate pain, including musculoskeletal pain (such as sprains and strains), dental pain, dysmenorrhea (painful menstrual periods), and postoperative pain.  It is also used in the treatment of acute and chronic pain associated with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID). Specifically it belongs to the propionic acid class of NSAIDs.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dexketoprofen is the S(+)-enantiomer of ketoprofen. It works by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2 which are responsible for producing prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever. By inhibiting COX enzymes, dexketoprofen decreases prostaglandin synthesis, thereby reducing pain and inflammation.

## **Alternate Names**

- The active ingredient is often listed as dexketoprofen trometamol.
- **Brand Names:** Keral®, Skudexa® (in combination with tramadol), Ketesse®.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dexketoprofen exerts its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects primarily through the inhibition of COX enzymes and subsequent reduction of prostaglandin synthesis.  It preferentially inhibits COX-2 over COX-1, although this selectivity is not absolute.  This inhibition reduces peripheral and central sensitization, thereby alleviating pain.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Dexketoprofen is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within approximately 30 minutes on an empty stomach. Food can delay the absorption rate. Following intramuscular or intravenous administration, absorption is rapid and complete.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver through glucuronidation.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted mainly by the kidneys, predominantly as the glucuronide conjugate.
- **Mode of Action:** Dexketoprofen binds to and inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.  This inhibition prevents the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, reducing pain and inflammation.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Dexketoprofen's primary mechanism is COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme inhibition.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Renal excretion, primarily as dexketoprofen glucuronide.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Oral:** 12.5 mg every 4-6 hours or 25 mg every 8 hours. Maximum daily dose: 75 mg. For faster pain relief in acute pain, administer on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before meals.
- **Intravenous/Intramuscular:** 50 mg every 8-12 hours (can be given every 6 hours if needed). Maximum daily dose: 150 mg for a maximum of 2 days. Switch to oral administration as soon as possible.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age as safety and efficacy haven't been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate therapy at the lower end of the dosage range (50 mg total daily dose for oral; and 50 mg total daily dose for intravenous/intramuscular). Increase dose cautiously if tolerated.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    - Mild impairment (CrCl 60-89 ml/min): Reduce initial dose to 50 mg total daily dose.  
    - Moderate to severe impairment (CrCl ≤59 mL/min): Contraindicated.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
    - Mild to moderate impairment (Child-Pugh score 5-9): Reduce initial dose to 50 mg total daily dose and monitor closely.
    - Severe impairment (Child-Pugh score 10-15): Contraindicated.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration and dose adjustment might be necessary in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or a history of gastrointestinal disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use/Emergency Situations:**  Intravenous/intramuscular administration of 50 mg every 8-12 hours (or every 6 hours if necessary) for a maximum of 2 days is recommended for managing moderate to severe acute pain in these settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- Adjust dosage based on renal/hepatic function, patient response, and concomitant medications. Close monitoring is essential in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, dizziness, headache, drowsiness, insomnia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration, or perforation; Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute renal failure, exfoliative dermatitis, angioedema, bronchospasm.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Chronic use can lead to gastrointestinal complications, renal impairment, and cardiovascular issues.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Anaphylaxis, severe skin reactions (SJS/TEN), gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatotoxicity, renal failure.

## **Contraindications**

- Third trimester of pregnancy and lactation.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Other NSAIDs (including aspirin): Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and ulceration.
- Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, heparin): Enhanced anticoagulant effect.
- Corticosteroids: Increased risk of gastrointestinal ulceration or bleeding.
- Lithium: Increased lithium levels.
