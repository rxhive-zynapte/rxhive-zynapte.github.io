## **Usage**

Dexlansoprazole is prescribed for the following medical conditions:

*   **Healing of all grades of erosive esophagitis (EE):**  This condition involves damage to the esophagus caused by stomach acid reflux.
*   **Maintenance of healed EE and relief of heartburn:** To prevent recurrence of erosive esophagitis and manage associated heartburn.
*   **Treatment of heartburn associated with symptomatic non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD):** For patients experiencing heartburn due to GERD without esophageal damage.

It is classified as a **proton pump inhibitor (PPI)**.

Dexlansoprazole's mechanism of action involves inhibiting the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme (proton pump) in gastric parietal cells. This blocks the final step of gastric acid production, thereby reducing the amount of acid in the stomach.

## **Alternate Names**

Dexlansoprazole is also known by the brand name **Dexilant**.  There do not seem to be other alternate names, international variations, or regional variations of the name.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Dexlansoprazole reduces gastric acid secretion by irreversibly inhibiting the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme system located on the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This action effectively blocks the final step in gastric acid production. The dual delayed-release formulation of Dexilant provides two peaks of drug release, resulting in prolonged acid suppression.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Dexlansoprazole exhibits two peaks of absorption after oral administration, one occurring within 1-2 hours and another within 4-5 hours.  Food may slightly delay absorption but does not clinically affect efficacy.
*   **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 enzymes into inactive metabolites.
*   **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism with subsequent biliary excretion. No parent drug is recovered in urine.

**Mode of Action:** Dexlansoprazole irreversibly binds to the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme, inhibiting its activity and reducing acid secretion. It does not bind to other receptors or modulate neurotransmitters.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism followed by biliary excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   **Healing of EE:** 60 mg once daily for up to 8 weeks.
*   **Maintenance of healed EE and relief of heartburn:** 30 mg once daily for up to 6 months.
*   **Symptomatic Non-Erosive GERD:** 30 mg once daily for 4 weeks.

#### **Children (12-17 years):**

*   **Healing of EE:** 60 mg once daily for up to 8 weeks.
*   **Maintenance of healed EE and relief of heartburn:** 30 mg once daily for up to 16 weeks (information provided in the sources indicated up to 6 months for adults, and up to 4 months as per MIMS).
*   **Symptomatic Non-Erosive GERD:** 30 mg once daily for 4 weeks.

*Dexlansoprazole is not recommended for children under 12 years of age.*

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary based on individual requirements. A daily dose of 60 mg should not be exceeded unless clinically indicated.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** 
Mild impairment: no adjustment is needed. Moderate impairment: 30 mg once daily should be considered, with a maximum of up to 8 weeks of treatment for EE. Severe impairment: not recommended.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider underlying conditions and potential drug interactions when determining the dosage.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dexlansoprazole's usage in the listed clinical scenarios generally falls under its established indications for GERD and erosive esophagitis.  The specific dosage should be determined based on patient-specific factors and the severity of the condition.
