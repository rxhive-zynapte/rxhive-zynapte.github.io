## **Usage**

Dextran 40 is prescribed for hypovolemia (low blood volume) caused by hemorrhage, surgery, trauma, or burns. It's also used for prophylaxis of thromboembolic events (blood clots) such as venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, particularly in surgical settings. Additionally, it is utilized as a priming fluid in extracorporeal circulation procedures.

It's classified as a plasma volume expander.

Dextran 40 increases the osmotic pressure of the blood, drawing fluid from the interstitial spaces into the vascular compartment, thereby expanding plasma volume. It also reduces blood viscosity and red blood cell aggregation, improving blood flow.

## **Alternate Names**

Dextran 40 is also known as Low Molecular Weight Dextran (LMD) or Intradex. Brand names include Gentran 40, Rheomacrodex, and LMD.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Dextran 40 exerts its effects by expanding plasma volume, thereby increasing blood pressure and improving tissue perfusion. It also has antithrombotic properties. This occurs by reducing blood viscosity, inhibiting red blood cell aggregation, and decreasing platelet adhesiveness.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Dextran 40 is administered intravenously. Being a large molecule, it's not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is primarily eliminated renally (through the kidneys) with some metabolism occurring in the liver and spleen.

**Mode of action:** Dextran 40 expands plasma volume by increasing the colloid osmotic pressure within blood vessels. This causes fluid to move from the interstitial spaces into the circulatory system. Its antithrombotic effects are related to reduced blood viscosity, inhibition of red blood cell and platelet aggregation, and enhanced fibrinolysis. It does not bind to specific receptors, inhibit enzymes, or modulate neurotransmitters.  The elimination pathway for Dextran 40 is primarily through renal excretion with some metabolic breakdown in the liver and spleen.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Shock:** Initially, 10 mL/kg (up to 20 mL/kg in the first 24 hours) by rapid IV infusion. Maintenance: up to 10 mL/kg/day; maximum 5 days.
* **Prophylaxis of Thromboembolism:** 500-1000 mL (approximately 10 mL/kg) on the day of surgery, followed by 500 mL/day for 2-3 days. Then 500 mL every 2-3 days for up to 2 weeks based on risk.
* **Extracorporeal Circulation:** 1-2 g/kg (10-20 mL/kg) added to the perfusion circuit.

#### **Children:**

* **Shock:** Infants: 0.5 g/kg (5 mL/kg). Children: 1 g/kg (10 mL/kg). Adolescents: Similar to adult dosing but with maximum daily limits (2 g/kg initially then 1 g/kg/day).
* **Prophylaxis of Thromboembolism:** Infants: 0.5 g/kg (5 mL/kg). Children: 1 g/kg (10 mL/kg). Adolescents: Based on the risk (e.g., 50â€“100 g on the day of surgery).
* **Extracorporeal Circulation:** Infants: 0.5 g/kg (5 mL/kg). Children: 1 g/kg (10 mL/kg).


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to potential for renal impairment and fluid overload. Adjust dosage accordingly.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with extreme caution. Adjust dosage based on creatinine clearance. Limit to maximum recommended dosages.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. No specific dosage adjustments provided, but close monitoring recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration for patients with cardiac decompensation, hemostatic defects, or extreme dehydration.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:** Dose as for prophylaxis of thromboembolism.
* **Emergency Situations (e.g., shock):** Rapid infusion of initial dose as outlined in standard adult and pediatric dosing.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are required for renal or hepatic impairment, considering individual patient characteristics.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Mild itching, rash, nausea, vomiting, mild dizziness, weakness, low-grade fever.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Anaphylactoid reactions (hypotension, wheezing, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest), bleeding complications, renal failure, pulmonary edema.

### **Long-Term Effects**

No long-term adverse effects specifically identified but prolonged bleeding time and increased risk of bleeding may occur with extended use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Anaphylactoid reactions are significant ADRs requiring immediate discontinuation of Dextran 40 and supportive treatment.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to dextran, severe cardiac decompensation, renal disease with severe oliguria or anuria, severe hemostatic defects (including drug-induced), extreme dehydration.

## **Drug Interactions**

Increased risk of bleeding with anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin). Enhanced nephrotoxic effects with some antibiotics (e.g., arbekacin). False elevation of serum glucose and interference with some laboratory tests. Additive medications should not be mixed with dextran solutions.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Category C. Use only if clearly needed, as effects on the fetus are unknown. Excretion into breast milk is unknown. Exercise caution if used during breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Plasma volume expansion via increased colloid osmotic pressure; antithrombotic effects via reduced viscosity, inhibition of red blood cell aggregation and platelet adhesion, and enhanced fibrinolysis.
* **Side Effects:** Itching, rash, nausea, vomiting, dizziness; rarely anaphylactoid reactions and bleeding.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe cardiac/renal dysfunction, bleeding disorders.
* **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, nephrotoxic agents.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category C; caution advised.
* **Dosage:** See above section for detailed dosage information.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, urine output, signs of fluid overload, bleeding time, hematocrit.

## **Popular Combinations**

Often used with crystalloid solutions for initial volume resuscitation.


## **Precautions**

Administer 20 mL of Dextran 1 prior to Dextran 40 to reduce the risk of anaphylactoid reactions. Monitor central venous pressure, especially during rapid infusion. Pre-screen for allergies, bleeding disorders, and renal/cardiac dysfunction. Use caution in pregnancy/breastfeeding, children, and the elderly.
