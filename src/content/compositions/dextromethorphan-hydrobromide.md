## **Usage**

- Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide is prescribed for the **temporary relief of non-productive cough** caused by minor throat and bronchial irritation, such as that which may occur with the common cold or inhaled irritants.  It is also used to suppress the impulse to cough to help induce sleep.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antitussive (Cough Suppressant)
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dextromethorphan acts centrally on the cough center in the medulla oblongata by increasing the cough threshold. It does not exhibit analgesic, sedative, or respiratory depressant effects at usual antitussive doses.


## **Alternate Names**

- Dextromethorphan HBr
- DXM (abbreviation)
- Robitussin DM (brand name, combined with guaifenesin)
- Delsym (brand name)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dextromethorphan suppresses the cough reflex by acting on the cough center in the medulla.  At higher doses, it acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist, producing dissociative effects.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
    - **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6 with polymorphic metabolism (poor metabolizers may experience prolonged effects).  Dextrorphan, a metabolite, also has antitussive activity.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted in the urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. Half-life varies (1.2 to 3.9 hours in extensive metabolizers, up to 45 hours in poor metabolizers).
- **Mode of Action:**  Binds to and antagonizes NMDA receptors in the central nervous system, particularly in the cough center, at higher doses. At lower doses, the mechanism is not fully understood but appears to involve sigma-1 receptor agonism and effects on serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**
    - NMDA receptor antagonist (at higher doses)
    - Sigma-1 receptor agonist (at lower doses)
    - Possible effects on serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of metabolites.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Immediate-release: 10-20 mg orally every 4 hours, or 30 mg every 6-8 hours, as needed. Maximum: 120 mg/day.
- Extended-release: 60 mg orally every 12 hours.  Maximum: 120 mg/day.

#### **Children:**

- Immediate-release:
    - 2-6 years: 2.5-5 mg orally every 4 hours or 7.5 mg every 6-8 hours, as needed. Maximum: 30 mg/day.
    - 6-12 years: 5-10 mg orally every 4 hours, or 15 mg every 6-8 hours, as needed. Maximum: 60 mg/day.

- Extended-release:
    - 4-6 years: 15 mg orally every 12 hours. Maximum: 30 mg/day.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are needed for elderly patients. But it's necessary to consider age-related decline in kidney or liver function and administer the lowest effective dose.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or pneumonia. Avoid in patients with respiratory failure.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dextromethorphan is typically used for outpatient management of cough and is not indicated for use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. 


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Consider dosage modifications in patients with renal impairment, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism, particularly CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.  Consult clinical guidelines and expert recommendations for appropriate adjustments.
