  - q: >-
      How does Dextromethorphan differ from codeine as a cough suppressant?**


      **A:** Unlike codeine, dextromethorphan does not bind to opioid receptors.
      This means it lacks analgesic and addictive properties at recommended
      doses, making it a safer option, especially in children.

      Can patients with liver disease take Dextromethorphan?**


      **A:**  Patients with hepatic impairment should use dextromethorphan with

  - q: >-
      What is the mechanism of serotonin syndrome associated with
      dextromethorphan?**


      **A:** Dextromethorphan can inhibit serotonin reuptake, particularly at
      high doses or in combination with other serotonergic drugs like MAOIs and
      SSRIs. This can lead to excessive serotonin levels in the synapse, causing
      symptoms like agitation, confusion, tremor, hyperthermia, and potentially
      life-threatening complications.

## **Usage**

- Dextromethorphan Hydrochloride is prescribed for the **temporary relief of cough caused by minor throat and bronchial irritation** associated with the common cold or inhaled irritants.  It is not effective for chronic cough associated with smoking, asthma, or emphysema, or when cough is accompanied by excessive phlegm.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antitussive (Cough Suppressant).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dextromethorphan works primarily in the medulla oblongata of the brainstem, where it **suppresses the cough reflex** by increasing the cough threshold. Although structurally similar to opioids, dextromethorphan has no analgesic or addictive properties at recommended doses.


## **Alternate Names**

- Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide (HBr)
- DXM
- Robitussin DM (and other brand names containing "DM")
- Delsym


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dextromethorphan exerts its antitussive effect by acting on sigma-1 receptors and, to a lesser extent, NMDA receptors in the central nervous system.  It does not bind to opioid receptors like codeine, explaining its lack of analgesic and addictive potential.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
    - **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme to dextrorphan, an active metabolite that also contributes to the antitussive effect.
    - **Elimination:**  Excreted primarily in the urine as metabolites.
- **Mode of Action:**  Dextromethorphan acts centrally to **increase the threshold for coughing**. This effect is primarily achieved by binding to the sigma-1 receptors. Its sigma-1 receptor agonism may also play a role in treating pseudobulbar affect by an unknown mechanism.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Sigma-1 receptor agonist, NMDA receptor antagonist at high doses. The primary route of metabolism is via CYP2D6 to its active metabolite, dextrorphan. About 10% of individuals are considered "poor metabolizers" and can experience greater side effects.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of metabolites after hepatic metabolism.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Immediate-release:** 10-20 mg every 4 hours or 30 mg every 6-8 hours, not to exceed 120 mg in 24 hours.
- **Extended-release:** 60 mg every 12 hours, not to exceed 120 mg in 24 hours.


#### **Children:**

- **Under 4 years:** Not recommended.
- **4-6 years:**
    - Immediate-release: 2.5-5 mg every 4 hours or 7.5 mg every 6-8 hours, not to exceed 30 mg in 24 hours.
    - Extended-release: 15 mg every 12 hours, not to exceed 30 mg in 24 hours.
- **6-12 years:**
    - Immediate-release: 5-10 mg every 4 hours or 15 mg every 6-8 hours, not to exceed 60 mg in 24 hours.
    - Extended-release: 30 mg every 12 hours, not to exceed 60 mg in 24 hours.
- **12 years and older:** Same as adult dose.
- Lozenges and strips have specific dose recommendations.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to potential age-related decline in hepatic and renal function. Start with the lower end of the dosing range.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustment is typically required, but caution is advised.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution due to potential impaired metabolism.  Consider a lower starting dose.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution should be exercised in patients with respiratory conditions like asthma or COPD.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dextromethorphan is generally not indicated for use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its sole indicated use is the symptomatic relief of cough.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary in elderly patients, those with hepatic impairment, or those who are known poor metabolizers of CYP2D6.  A lower starting dose and careful monitoring are recommended in these populations.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Dizziness
- Drowsiness
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Constipation
- Nervousness
- Restlessness
- Confusion

- Seizures
- Hallucinations
- Serotonin syndrome
- Respiratory depression (at very high doses)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Limited data on long-term effects, but chronic high-dose abuse can lead to neurological and psychological problems.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any of the rare but serious side effects listed above warrant immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to dextromethorphan.
- Concurrent use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) or within 14 days of stopping MAOI therapy.
- Patients with respiratory depression or at risk of respiratory failure.
