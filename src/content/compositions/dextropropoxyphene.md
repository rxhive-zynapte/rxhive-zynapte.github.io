      What is the recommended dosage for Dextropropoxyphene?**

      **A:** Dextropropoxyphene is no longer recommended or available in many
      countries due to safety concerns. Historically, the adult dose was 65mg of
      the hydrochloride salt or 100mg of the napsylate salt every 4 hours as
      needed, with a maximum daily dose of 390 mg/day (HCl) or 600 mg/day
      (napsylate).

## **Usage**

- Dextropropoxyphene was prescribed for the relief of mild to moderate pain. It was also used as a cough suppressant and had local anesthetic properties.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Opioid analgesic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dextropropoxyphene binds to mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system, inhibiting pain signal transmission and altering pain perception. It also has some activity at kappa-opioid receptors.

## **Alternate Names**

- Propoxyphene (refers to the racemic mixture, but only the dextro- isomer has analgesic effects)
- **Brand Names:** Darvon (dextropropoxyphene only), Darvocet (dextropropoxyphene and acetaminophen), Di-Gesic, Capadex, Paradex, and Doloxene are among the brand names under which dextropropoxyphene has been marketed, often in combination with paracetamol (acetaminophen).  Please note that due to safety concerns, dextropropoxyphene-containing products have been withdrawn from many markets, including the US and Europe.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dextropropoxyphene primarily affects the central nervous system by binding to mu-opioid receptors, resulting in analgesia, cough suppression, and potential euphoria. At higher doses, it can cause respiratory depression, sedation, and other opioid-related side effects.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Well-absorbed orally.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 to nordextropropoxyphene, its major active metabolite. Nordextropropoxyphene has a longer half-life than dextropropoxyphene.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted primarily in the urine.
- **Mode of Action:** Binds to mu and kappa opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord. It also inhibits N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which may contribute to its analgesic effects. May prolong QTc interval through interactions with several ion channels.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Binds to mu and kappa opioid receptors; inhibits NMDA receptors. Metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

**Dextropropoxyphene is no longer available in many countries due to safety concerns (cardiac toxicity, overdose risk). The following information is for historical reference only and should not be used for prescribing or administering the drug.**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Historically, the usual adult dose was 65 mg dextropropoxyphene hydrochloride or 100 mg dextropropoxyphene napsylate every 4 hours as needed for pain. The maximum recommended dose varies but was often limited to 6 capsules or tablets per day.

#### **Children:** Use in children was generally not recommended, and safety and efficacy had not been established.

#### **Special Cases:** Dosage adjustments were advised for elderly patients and those with renal or hepatic impairment.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dextropropoxyphene was **not** recommended for use in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations due to its narrow therapeutic index and risk of serious side effects.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose reductions were necessary for elderly patients and those with renal or hepatic impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Dizziness
- Sedation
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Constipation

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Respiratory depression

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to dextropropoxyphene or acetaminophen

- Concomitant use of MAO inhibitors


## **Drug Interactions**

- **CNS Depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines, other opioids):** Increased risk of respiratory depression and sedation.
- **CYP3A4 Inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin):** Increased dextropropoxyphene levels and risk of toxicity.
- **CYP3A4 Inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampicin):** Decreased dextropropoxyphene levels and reduced efficacy.
- **Serotonergic Drugs (e.g., SSRIs, MAOIs):** Increased risk of serotonin syndrome.
- **Warfarin:** Increased risk of bleeding.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (older FDA classification; no longer marketed in the US) - Use during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 
- **Breastfeeding:** Dextropropoxyphene is excreted in breast milk.  It is recommended to weigh the risks and benefits carefully. Safer alternatives may be preferred.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Mu-opioid receptor agonist, kappa-opioid receptor activity, NMDA receptor inhibition.
- **Side Effects:** Dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, constipation, respiratory depression, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, respiratory depression, acute alcoholism, suicidal ideation, concomitant MAOI use.
- **Drug Interactions:** CNS depressants, CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers, serotonergic drugs, warfarin.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; weigh risks and benefits.
- **Dosage:** Historically 65 mg HCl or 100 mg napsylate every 4 hours, not to exceed maximum daily dose.  (No longer marketed in many countries).
