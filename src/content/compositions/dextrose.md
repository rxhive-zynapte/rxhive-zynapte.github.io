## **Usage**

Dextrose, a simple sugar (monosaccharide), is primarily used to treat hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). It is also used in various clinical settings for fluid and calorie replacement when oral intake is inadequate, and as an adjunctive treatment for hyperkalemia.  It can be administered orally for mild hypoglycemia or intravenously for more severe cases or when oral intake isn't feasible. Its pharmacological classification is as a carbohydrate, specifically a monosaccharide glucose, and can be categorized under fluid and electrolyte replenisher/nutritional supplement.  Dextrose works by directly increasing blood glucose levels, providing an immediate energy source for cells, and facilitating cellular uptake of potassium in hyperkalemia when combined with insulin.

## **Alternate Names**

Dextrose is also known as D-glucose, D-glucopyranose, grape sugar, blood sugar, or corn sugar.  Brand names vary widely depending on the formulation and manufacturer but some popular brand names containing Dextrose are:  D50W (50% Dextrose in Water), D10W (10% Dextrose in Water), and various combinations with other solutions like saline.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Dextrose directly increases blood glucose concentrations. When administered intravenously, it provides a readily available energy source for cells.  In hyperkalemia, dextrose combined with insulin stimulates potassium uptake into cells, reducing serum potassium levels.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** When given orally, dextrose is rapidly absorbed from the small intestine. Intravenous administration delivers it directly into the bloodstream.
* **Metabolism:**  Dextrose is metabolized via glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, ultimately yielding carbon dioxide, water, and ATP (energy). Excess glucose is converted to glycogen for storage, primarily in the liver and muscles.
* **Elimination:**  Dextrose is not directly eliminated. It is completely metabolized, with the byproducts (CO2 and water) eliminated through respiration and urine.

**Mode of Action:** Dextrose doesn't bind to specific receptors. It acts as a substrate for energy production, driving cellular metabolism.  In combination with insulin, dextrose facilitates potassium entry into cells by stimulating the sodium-potassium pump.  It doesn't involve enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation. Elimination pathways involve metabolism to CO2 and water, not direct renal or hepatic excretion, or metabolism by CYP enzymes.


## **Dosage**

Dosage guidelines for dextrose vary significantly depending on the clinical context and the patient's specific needs.  Consultation with standard references and institutional protocols is crucial for determining appropriate dosing.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
* **Hypoglycemia:**  10-25g (20-50 mL of 50% solution) intravenously; may repeat as needed for severe cases. Oral administration of 15-20g may be considered for mild to moderate hypoglycemia.
* **Hyperkalemia:** 25-50g dextrose along with intravenous insulin as directed by established protocols.

#### **Children:**
* **Hypoglycemia:** Dosing based on weight and age is crucial, typically starting with 0.25-0.5 g/kg/dose (1-2 mL/kg/dose of 25% solution) IV in children younger than 6 months, and 0.5-1 g/kg up to 25 g (2-4 mL/kg/dose of 25% solution) IV in children older than 6 months; careful monitoring is essential.

#### **Special Cases:**
* **Elderly Patients:**  Start with lower doses and adjust cautiously due to potential age-related decreases in renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustments based on the degree of impairment are necessary due to potential aluminum accumulation.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advisable although specific dosage adjustments might not be strictly required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Careful consideration is crucial, especially in patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease.  Adjustments may be necessary based on specific conditions and concomitant medications.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dextrose dosing in specific clinical situations varies greatly and should be guided by established protocols.  Factors like patient condition, underlying illness, and concurrent treatments heavily influence dosing.

* **Intubation:** Used to manage hypoglycemia during or after intubation if needed.
* **Surgical Procedures:** May be included in intravenous fluids or used to treat intraoperative or postoperative hypoglycemia.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:**  May be a component of IV fluids in ventilated patients.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  Dextrose solutions of varying concentrations are frequently used in ICU patients to meet nutritional and fluid needs.
* **Emergency Situations** (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest): Dextrose may be administered to correct hypoglycemia in these emergencies. 

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are essential in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism. These adjustments often involve reducing the dose and increasing the monitoring frequency.  Consultation with specialist services like nephrology or endocrinology may be beneficial.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Local irritation or pain at the intravenous injection site may occur.  Hyperglycemia can result if the dextrose infusion rate is too high.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Severe hyperglycemia, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia), fluid overload, allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis).

### **Long-Term Effects**

Thrombophlebitis with prolonged peripheral intravenous administration. Liver dysfunction may occur with long-term parenteral nutrition, especially in preterm infants. Aluminum toxicity is a risk in patients with renal impairment with prolonged use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Anaphylaxis, severe hyperglycemia leading to altered mental status and even coma.


## **Contraindications**

Known hypersensitivity to dextrose.  Severe dehydration.  Caution is necessary in patients with known glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus.

## **Drug Interactions**

Clinically significant drug interactions with dextrose are rare.  However, the effects of other drugs that affect blood glucose levels, such as insulin, oral hypoglycemic agents, and corticosteroids, may be altered by dextrose administration.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Dextrose can be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but it is crucial to monitor blood glucose levels closely. High doses may lead to fetal or neonatal hyperglycemia.  It's important to consult specialist services to evaluate risk versus benefit and consider alternative treatment options if available.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Directly elevates blood glucose, provides energy substrate, facilitates cellular potassium uptake with insulin.
* **Side Effects:** Local injection site reactions, hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe dehydration.
* **Drug Interactions:** Minimal, mostly related to drugs affecting blood glucose.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Can be used cautiously with close glucose monitoring.
* **Dosage:** Varies widely; refer to clinical guidelines and patient-specific factors.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood glucose, serum electrolytes (especially potassium, phosphate, magnesium), fluid balance.

## **Popular Combinations**

Dextrose is commonly combined with saline solutions (e.g., normal saline, lactated Ringer's) for fluid and electrolyte replacement, and with amino acid solutions for parenteral nutrition.


## **Precautions**

Screen for allergies and assess baseline renal and hepatic function.  Monitor patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance closely. Infuse via central venous catheter for higher concentrations to minimize local venous irritation and thrombophlebitis.
