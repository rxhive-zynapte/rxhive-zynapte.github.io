## **Usage**

- Dextrothyroxine is prescribed to lower high cholesterol levels in the blood (hyperlipidemia), specifically type II hyperlipoproteinemia, in patients who haven't responded adequately to diet and other treatments.  It is no longer commonly used due to its cardiac side effects.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antihyperlipidemic agent, thyroid hormone analog.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dextrothyroxine increases the breakdown (catabolism) of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), leading to increased excretion of cholesterol and bile acids through the biliary route. It also stimulates hepatic lipase activity, improving triglyceride utilization and lowering lipoprotein(a).

## **Alternate Names**

- Dextrothyroxine sodium
- D-Thyroxine
- **Brand Name:** Choloxin (discontinued)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dextrothyroxine primarily affects lipid metabolism, promoting the breakdown and excretion of cholesterol. It also has some metabolic effects similar to other thyroid hormones, but less pronounced.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Absorbed orally.
    - **Metabolism:** Metabolized in the liver, but specifics are not fully elucidated.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted primarily via the biliary route into the feces, with some renal excretion. The elimination half-life is not precisely defined.
- **Mode of Action:** The exact mechanism isn't fully understood. It acts on the liver to increase LDL formation, though the greater effect is increased LDL catabolism. It also increases hepatic lipase activity. Information on receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation is not widely documented.


## **Dosage**

It's important to note that due to its cardiac side effect profile and the availability of better tolerated alternatives, Dextrothyroxine is rarely used clinically today and the following dosage information is primarily for informational purposes based on its previous use.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial: 1-2 mg orally per day.
- Increase by 1-2 mg at monthly intervals as needed based on cholesterol response.
- Usual Maintenance Dose: 4-8 mg per day.
- Maximum: 8 mg/day.

#### **Children:**

- Not generally recommended due to limited safety and efficacy data.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses (1 mg/day) and titrate cautiously due to an increased risk of cardiovascular adverse effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised, dosage adjustments may be necessary. Close monitoring for side effects is crucial.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, dosage adjustments may be necessary. Close monitoring is essential.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Contraindicated in patients with known heart disease (angina pectoris, myocardial infarction history, cardiac arrhythmias), hypertension (other than mild), or thyrotoxicosis.  Use with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus, as it may worsen glycemic control.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dextrothyroxine is *not* indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Renal or hepatic dysfunction: Monitor closely and adjust dosage as needed.
- Diabetes mellitus: Monitor blood glucose closely and adjust antidiabetic medications if necessary.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Insomnia
- Nervousness
- Tremor
- Weight loss
- Diarrhea
- Hair loss
- Headache
- Skin rash


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reaction
- Myocardial infarction (heart attack)
- Angina pectoris
- Cardiac arrhythmias
- Excessive sweating


### **Long-Term Effects:**

The long-term effects of Dextrothyroxine are not well-studied due to the discontinuation of its widespread use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Allergic reactions
- Cardiovascular events (e.g., myocardial infarction, angina, arrhythmias).



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to dextrothyroxine
-  Thyrotoxicosis
- Known heart disease
- Moderate to severe hypertension
- Adrenal insufficiency (requires careful monitoring)



## **Drug Interactions**

- Warfarin: Dextrothyroxine potentiates warfarin's anticoagulant effect; reduce warfarin dosage.
- Digitalis glycosides: May increase sensitivity to digitalis; careful monitoring recommended.
- Oral hypoglycemics/insulin: May worsen glucose control; monitor glucose closely.
- Catecholamines: May increase cardiovascular effects; careful monitoring recommended.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Historically categorized as Pregnancy Category X (contraindicated) due to potential risks to the developing fetus. Safer alternatives should be used.
- **Breastfeeding:** Avoid use as it may pass into breastmilk and affect the infant's thyroid function.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Increases LDL catabolism and excretion of cholesterol.
- **Side Effects:** Insomnia, nervousness, tremor, weight loss, cardiovascular effects.
- **Contraindications:** Heart disease, hypertension, thyrotoxicosis.
- **Drug Interactions:** Warfarin, digitalis, oral hypoglycemics, catecholamines.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy; avoid during breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** 1-8 mg/day orally (adults).
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Cholesterol levels, thyroid function tests, ECG in patients with cardiac risk factors.


## **Popular Combinations**

Dextrothyroxine is generally not used in combination therapies due to its adverse effects and discontinuation.


## **Precautions**

- Monitor for cardiovascular side effects, especially in elderly patients.
- Closely monitor thyroid function tests.
