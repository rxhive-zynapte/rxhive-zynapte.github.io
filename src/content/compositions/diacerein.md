      **A:** Patients should avoid alcohol while taking Diacerein due to the
      potential increased risk of liver damage. They should also maintain
      adequate hydration, especially if they experience diarrhea. Regular
      exercise and a balanced diet are also encouraged to maintain joint health.

## **Usage**

- Diacerein is prescribed for the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis (OA), primarily of the hip and knee.  It reduces pain and improves joint function. It has a delayed onset of action but a prolonged effect.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Anti-inflammatory, slow-acting symptomatic treatment for osteoarthritis.  It is classified as an anthraquinone derivative.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Diacerein is a prodrug that is metabolized to rhein. Rhein inhibits interleukin-1 (IL-1) synthesis and activity. IL-1 is a cytokine that plays a key role in inflammation and cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis. By inhibiting IL-1, diacerein reduces inflammation and slows the progression of cartilage damage.



## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:** Diacetylrhein
- **Brand Names:** Artrodar, Art 50, Zondar, Recart


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Diacerein's primary effect is achieved through its active metabolite, rhein. Rhein inhibits the synthesis and activity of interleukin-1 (IL-1), a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. It also inhibits the production of other inflammatory mediators and reduces the activity of enzymes that break down cartilage. This leads to a decrease in pain, stiffness, and swelling in the affected joints and may also slow the progression of structural damage.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Diacerein is almost completely absorbed after oral administration and undergoes rapid and extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver, where it is converted to rhein. Peak plasma concentrations of rhein are reached approximately 2.5 hours after administration. Food intake can delay absorption but increase bioavailability by about 25%. Rhein is highly bound to plasma proteins (99%). It is further metabolized to rhein glucuronide and rhein sulfate.  Rhein and its metabolites are eliminated via both renal (approximately 30%) and fecal (approximately 53%) routes. The elimination half-life of rhein is approximately 4-10 hours.

- **Mode of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Rhein inhibits the synthesis of IL-1 by suppressing gene expression.  It also blocks IL-1 binding to its receptor, preventing the downstream inflammatory cascade. Furthermore, rhein inhibits the activity of certain enzymes involved in cartilage degradation.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal and fecal. Approximately 30% is excreted in the urine (20% as unchanged rhein and 80% as metabolites), and about 53% is eliminated in the feces.




## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial: 50 mg once daily with the evening meal for the first 2-4 weeks.
- Maintenance: 50 mg twice daily, one capsule with breakfast and one with the evening meal. Capsules should be swallowed whole with water.
- Maximum dose: 100 mg/day.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for children under 15 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients (over 65 years):** Not generally recommended due to increased risk of severe diarrhea and related complications. If used, initiate with 50 mg once daily for 4 weeks, then increase if tolerated, under close monitoring.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Moderate impairment: No dose adjustment usually needed but monitor closely. Severe impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min): Reduce daily dose by 50%. 

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in patients with current or history of liver disease.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use cautiously in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or other conditions that might increase their risk of developing adverse events. Monitor accordingly.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Not typically indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

- As per special cases listed above.


## **Side Effects**
