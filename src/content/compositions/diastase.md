## **Usage**

Diastase is a digestive enzyme, specifically an amylase, that breaks down starch into smaller sugar molecules like maltose. It is used to treat indigestion, dyspepsia, and other digestive disorders. Its pharmacological classification is digestive enzyme.  It works by supplementing the body's natural amylase, improving the digestion of carbohydrates.

## **Alternate Names**

Diastase is also known as fungal diastase when derived from fungi. It's sometimes combined with other enzymes like pepsin and marketed under brand names such as Aristozyme, Unienzyme, Vivadase, Ownzyme, and Alzyme.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Diastase catalyzes the hydrolysis of alpha-1,4 glycosidic linkages in starch. This breaks down complex carbohydrates into simpler sugars (maltose and dextrins), making them easier to absorb in the small intestine. This process reduces the workload on the pancreas and can improve symptoms like bloating, gas, and indigestion.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Diastase is taken orally and acts locally in the digestive tract.  It is not absorbed systemically. Information about its metabolism and elimination pathways is limited as it primarily acts within the digestive tract.

**Mode of Action:** Diastase binds to starch molecules and breaks the glycosidic bonds through hydrolysis, releasing smaller sugar molecules.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Diastase does not have specific receptor binding or inhibitory effects outside its enzymatic action on starch.

**Elimination Pathways:** Diastase, being an enzyme, gets degraded in the gastrointestinal tract and is not subject to the typical pharmacokinetic processes of absorption, metabolism, and systemic elimination like other drugs.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The typical dosage for adults varies depending on the formulation and the condition being treated. Generally, 1-2 tablets or capsules, or 5-10ml of liquid formulation are taken after meals.  For specific brand names, please consult the individual product leaflet.


#### **Children:** Dosage for children should be determined by a doctor. Liquid formulations are commonly used for children and often half the adult dose is recommended but this should be confirmed with a healthcare professional. Pediatric safety should be ascertained by a healthcare professional.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: Dosage adjustments are typically not required. But dose adjustments based on individual needs may be made at the physician's discretion.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Dose modification is usually not needed as it acts locally and is not absorbed systemically.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**:  Dose modification is usually not needed as it acts locally and is not absorbed systemically.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Consult a healthcare professional before use, especially with diabetes, pancreatic disorders or gastrointestinal conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  Diastase is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU. Its use is primarily for digestive support.

### **Dosage Adjustments** Dose adjustments are generally not needed for renal or hepatic impairment. However, individual factors might influence the dosage and should be assessed by a physician.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Abdominal discomfort
- Nausea

### **Long-Term Effects** No specific long-term adverse effects have been reported.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)** Allergic reactions are rare but require immediate medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to diastase or any component of the formulation.
- Acute pancreatitis.


## **Drug Interactions**

- May interact with acarbose and miglitol (antidiabetic drugs).
- Alcohol may exacerbate some digestive issues and should be avoided during the course of the treatment.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult with a physician before use during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. Safety data in these situations is limited.

## **Drug Profile Summary**
