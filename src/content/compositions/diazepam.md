## **Usage**

Diazepam is prescribed for a variety of medical conditions, including:

* **Anxiety disorders:** Generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder.
* **Acute alcohol withdrawal:**  Manages symptoms like agitation, tremors, and delirium tremens.
* **Muscle spasms:** Relieves skeletal muscle spasms caused by injury, inflammation, or neurological conditions like cerebral palsy.
* **Preoperative sedation:** Reduces anxiety and tension before surgical procedures.
* **Status epilepticus:** Controls prolonged or repetitive seizures.
* **Sedation in intensive care unit (ICU):** Facilitates mechanical ventilation and manages anxiety and agitation.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Benzodiazepine,  Anxiolytic, Sedative-Hypnotic, Anticonvulsant, Skeletal Muscle Relaxant.

**Mechanism of Action:** Diazepam enhances the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. It binds to the benzodiazepine site on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening. This leads to increased chloride influx into neurons, hyperpolarization, and reduced neuronal excitability.


## **Alternate Names**

* **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Diazepam
* **Valium** (Commonly used name in some regions)

**Brand Names:** Valium, Valtoco, Diastat (rectal gel), Diazepam Intensol (concentrated oral solution).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Diazepam's effects on the body include:

* **Sedation and hypnosis:**  Reduces anxiety, promotes relaxation, and induces sleep.
* **Anxiolysis:** Decreases feelings of worry and fear.
* **Muscle relaxation:** Reduces muscle tone and spasticity.
* **Anticonvulsant activity:** Suppresses seizure activity.
* **Anterograde amnesia:** Impairs the formation of new memories.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Well-absorbed orally. Rapid absorption after intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) administration. Erratic absorption after IM injection.
* **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 enzymes, into active metabolites (desmethyldiazepam, oxazepam, temazepam).
* **Elimination:**  Primarily eliminated through the kidneys. Prolonged half-life (20-80 hours), extended in the elderly and patients with hepatic impairment. Active metabolites contribute to the long duration of action.

**Mode of Action:** Diazepam acts allosterically at the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor complex. This enhances GABA's inhibitory effects, leading to increased chloride conductance and neuronal hyperpolarization.


**Receptor Binding:** Binds to the benzodiazepine site on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism followed by renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral:** 2-10 mg, 2-4 times daily, adjusted according to the indication and severity.
* **IM/IV:** 2-10 mg (moderate anxiety), 5-10 mg (severe anxiety), repeated every 3-4 hours as needed. Max dose: 30 mg in 8 hours.

#### **Children:**

* Dosage based on weight and age (refer to pediatric guidelines).  Caution is advised in children under 6 months, especially regarding toxic dose potentials. Generally considered potentially toxic doses in patients under 6 years: greater than 0.5 mg/kg.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Initiate with lower doses (2-2.5 mg, 1-2 times daily) and titrate cautiously.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution is advised in prolonged administration. Reduce the dose for prolonged use.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Reduce dose and monitor closely. Contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Adjust dose based on individual conditions and drug interactions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Intubation:** 5-10 mg IV bolus, followed by 5 mg aliquots every minute until adequate sedation is achieved. Use with other agents such as opioids or neuromuscular blockers is left to the attending physician.
* **Surgical Procedures:**  10 mg IM preoperatively (1-2 hours before surgery), or 5-15 mg IV (5-10 minutes prior to cardioversion). In endoscopic procedures administer slow IV until desired sedation response (up to 20 mg).  Reduce narcotic dosing by at least 1/3.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** 5-10 mg IV loading dose, followed by 0.03-0.1 mg/kg every 30 minutes to 6 hours, or 1-7 mg every 30 min to 6 hours, depending on titration needs.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** 5-10 mg IV/IM, repeated every 5-10 minutes; not to exceed 30 mg, or 0.5 mg/kg rectally. A second rectal dose of 0.25 mg/kg may be given after 10 minutes.
* **Emergency Situations (e.g., status epilepticus):** 5-10 mg IV initially, repeated every 10-15 minutes up to a maximum of 30 mg. Repeat in 2-4 hours if needed. For pediatric status epilepticus initial dose is 0.2 mg/kg IV (max: 8mg) slowly over 1 minute, then repeat at 0.15 mg/kg up to 10 mg maximum. Can give midazolam IM if no IV access available.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments necessary based on renal/hepatic function, comorbidities, concomitant medications, and patient response.
