## **Usage**

Dibasic calcium phosphate is prescribed to prevent or treat hypocalcemia in individuals with insufficient dietary calcium intake. It's used to manage conditions arising from low calcium levels, such as osteoporosis, osteomalacia/rickets, hypoparathyroidism, and latent tetany.  It's also prescribed for individuals with increased calcium needs like pregnant or breastfeeding women, postmenopausal women, and patients on medications like phenytoin, phenobarbital, or prednisone.  It is classified as a mineral supplement, specifically a calcium supplement. It provides a source of calcium and phosphate, which are essential for bone health and various physiological processes. Its mechanism of action involves providing a readily available source of calcium to increase serum calcium levels, thus supporting normal nerve, muscle, and cellular function, as well as bone mineralization.

## **Alternate Names**

- Dicalcium phosphate
- Calcium monohydrogen phosphate
- Calcium hydrogen phosphate
- Dicalcium orthophosphate, dihydrate
- Calcium phosphate dibasic dihydrate
- Calcium phosphate, dibasic

Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and formulation. Examples include those combined with Vitamin D and/or Magnesium.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Dibasic calcium phosphate elevates serum calcium levels, restoring normal neuromuscular function and bone mineralization.  Calcium is crucial for nerve impulse transmission, muscle contraction, blood clotting, and enzyme activity. Phosphate, a component of ATP, plays a vital role in energy storage and transfer.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Calcium absorption occurs primarily in the duodenum and jejunum and is enhanced by acidic environments and vitamin D.  Absorption can be hindered by factors like high-fiber diets, phytic acid, oxalic acid, and certain medications.
* **Distribution:**  Absorbed calcium is distributed throughout the body, primarily to bones and teeth (99%).  The remaining calcium resides in extracellular fluid, intracellular compartments, and blood.
* **Metabolism:** Calcium itself is not metabolized. However, its homeostasis is regulated by vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and calcitonin.
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted through the kidneys and to a lesser extent through feces.

**Mode of Action:** Dibasic calcium phosphate directly provides calcium ions that participate in various biological processes, including bone mineralization, neuromuscular function, and enzymatic reactions. It does not have specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation properties.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The typical adult dose ranges from 1-2 grams of elemental calcium per day, divided into multiple doses for optimal absorption. The exact dosage and formulation will depend on the specific calcium supplement used and the individual's needs.

#### **Children:**

Pediatric dosing varies according to age and health status. Recommended dietary allowances should be followed, with supplementation only under the guidance of a healthcare professional.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  May require dose adjustments based on renal function and potential drug interactions.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Close monitoring of calcium and phosphate levels is essential due to impaired excretion. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Considerations include underlying metabolic or endocrine disorders that may affect calcium metabolism.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dibasic calcium phosphate is not typically used for specific clinical procedures like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use. It's primarily used for long-term management of hypocalcemia and related conditions.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on serum calcium and phosphate levels, renal function, and potential drug interactions.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

- Constipation
- Bloating
- Gas
- Upset stomach


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Levothyroxine: Reduced absorption of levothyroxine
- Thiazide diuretics: May increase risk of hypercalcemia
- Digoxin: May enhance digoxin toxicity in the presence of hypercalcemia


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Dibasic calcium phosphate is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding when taken within the recommended dietary allowances. Higher doses should be used only if clearly needed and under medical supervision.
