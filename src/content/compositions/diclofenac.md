## **Usage**

Diclofenac is prescribed for the short-term treatment of pain and inflammation associated with various conditions, including:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Ankylosing spondylitis
* Acute gout
* Migraine attacks
* Post-traumatic and post-operative pain and swelling
* Primary dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation)
* Adnexitis (inflammation of the ovaries and fallopian tubes)
* Painful syndromes of the vertebral column
* Non-articular rheumatism

**Pharmacological Classification:** Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and analgesic.

**Mechanism of Action:** Diclofenac inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2, which are responsible for the production of prostaglandins, substances that mediate pain and inflammation.

## **Alternate Names**

Diclofenac is known by various names internationally.  Brand names include Voltaren, Cataflam, Diclax, Voltfast, Zipsor, Zorvolex, Cambia, and others.  It is also available as a sodium or potassium salt.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Diclofenac reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis through the blocking of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.  It is a non-selective COX inhibitor.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Diclofenac is well absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 1-2 hours for immediate release formulations and approximately 4 hours for delayed-release formulations.  Absorption may be delayed if taken with food, especially with high-fat meals. Rectal absorption is slower and more variable. Intramuscular absorption is generally rapid and complete. Intravenous infusion provides 100% bioavailability.
* **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP2C9.
* **Elimination:**  Primarily eliminated via renal excretion of metabolites. A smaller portion is eliminated in bile.


**Mode of Action:**  Diclofenac competes with arachidonic acid for the active site on COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. This inhibits the formation of prostaglandin G2 and H2, thereby reducing the production of downstream pro-inflammatory prostaglandins and thromboxanes.  

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion (approximately 65%), with biliary/fecal excretion accounting for the remainder.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral:** 50 mg two or three times daily, or 75mg twice daily.
* **Intravenous/Intramuscular:** 75mg once or twice daily, max 150mg/day. 
* **Rectal:** 50mg up to three times per day. 

#### **Children:**

Use is generally not recommended for children under 14 years old. Dosages above this age must be determined by a doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lowest effective dose. Careful monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; dosage adjustment may be needed in moderate to severe cases. Contraindicated in renal failure.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution; dosage adjustment may be needed in moderate to severe cases. Contraindicated in liver failure.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or diabetes.  Close monitoring is crucial.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Specific dosages for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, and ICU use are not standardized and should be determined by a clinician based on the individual patient's needs.  

* **Emergency Situations:**  Appropriate dosages must be determined by the treating physician based on the specific emergency situation. Diclofenac is indicated for mild to moderate acute pain, so other analgesics may be more appropriate.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on individual patient characteristics, comorbidities, and therapeutic response.  Renal and hepatic impairment require careful consideration and possible dosage reductions.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation)
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Rash
* Fluid retention
* Elevated liver enzymes

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration
* Myocardial infarction
* Stroke
* Heart failure
* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Renal dysfunction
* Stevens-Johnson Syndrome
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis
* Aplastic anemia


### **Long-Term Effects:**

* Chronic kidney disease
* Cardiovascular complications
* Gastrointestinal issues (ulcers, bleeding)

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** As noted above, rare but serious side effects often require immediate intervention.  Specifically, any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, allergic reactions, cardiovascular events, or renal impairment should be treated immediately.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to diclofenac or other NSAIDs
* History of asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs
* Active or recent peptic ulcer disease
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Severe renal impairment
* Severe hepatic impairment
* Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery perioperatively
* Pregnancy (third trimester)



## **Drug Interactions**

* **Anticoagulants:** Increased risk of bleeding
* **Lithium:** Increased lithium levels
* **Methotrexate:** Increased methotrexate toxicity
* **Diuretics:** Reduced diuretic effect and increased risk of renal impairment
* **Antihypertensives:** Reduced antihypertensive efficacy
* **Other NSAIDs or Salicylates:** Increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects
* **CYP2C9 Inhibitors and Inducers:** Can alter diclofenac metabolism.  Concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g. voriconazole) may increase diclofenac plasma concentrations whereas CYP2C9 inducers (e.g. rifampicin) may reduce diclofenac levels.
* **Alcohol:** Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Avoid in the first and third trimesters. Limited data in the second trimester, use with caution if potential benefits outweigh risk.
* **Fetal Risks:** Premature closure of ductus arteriosus, prolonged labor, increased risk of bleeding.
* **Breastfeeding:** Present in small amounts in breast milk. Use with caution, monitor infant for any adverse effects.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Non-selective COX inhibitor, reducing prostaglandin synthesis.
* **Side Effects:** Gastrointestinal upset, headache, dizziness, rash. Serious: GI bleeding, myocardial infarction, stroke.
* **Contraindications:**  Hypersensitivity, asthma/urticaria with aspirin, GI bleeding, severe renal/hepatic impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, lithium, methotrexate, diuretics, antihypertensives, alcohol.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid during the first and third trimesters. Caution during breastfeeding.

## **Popular Combinations**

Diclofenac is sometimes used in combination with misoprostol (to reduce GI side effects) or other analgesics (for enhanced pain relief).

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess for allergies, cardiovascular, renal, and hepatic function before initiating therapy.
* **Specific Populations:** As described above.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid alcohol. Limit driving or operating machinery if dizziness or drowsiness occurs.
