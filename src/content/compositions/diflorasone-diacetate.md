## **Usage**

Diflorasone diacetate is a potent topical corticosteroid indicated for the relief of inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, such as eczema, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis.  It is classified as a glucocorticosteroid.  The drug works by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the skin, which leads to decreased production of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes. This action reduces inflammation, itching, and vasoconstriction in the affected area.

## **Alternate Names**

Diflorasone diacetate does not have any official alternate names. Brand names include Apexicon E, Psorcon, Maxiflor, and Florone (discontinued).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Diflorasone diacetate exerts its effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the skin cells. This binding modulates gene transcription, leading to the suppression of inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and cytokines. The drug also inhibits the migration of inflammatory cells to the affected area and reduces vascular permeability, thereby minimizing swelling and redness.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Diflorasone diacetate is minimally absorbed through intact skin (approximately 1%). Absorption is increased if the skin is inflamed or damaged or if occlusive dressings are used.  The absorbed drug is metabolized primarily in the liver via CYP enzymes and is excreted through the kidneys.  

**Mode of Action:** Upon entering the target cell, diflorasone diacetate binds to glucocorticoid receptors. This complex translocates to the nucleus and binds to specific DNA sequences, influencing gene expression. As a result, the production of inflammatory mediators is downregulated, ultimately leading to a reduction in skin inflammation and itching.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism through CYP enzymes, followed by renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin film to the affected area 1 to 3 times daily.

#### **Children:** Apply a thin film to the affected area 1 to 3 times daily. Monitor growth parameters regularly due to the potential for HPA axis suppression and growth retardation.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lowest effective dose and monitor for adverse effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment might be necessary.  Monitor closely.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment might be necessary.  Monitor closely.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use cautiously in patients with diabetes, hypertension, or other conditions that may be exacerbated by corticosteroids.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Diflorasone diacetate is intended for topical use only and is not indicated for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are typically based on patient response and tolerability.  Consider lower doses in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, children, and the elderly.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Burning, stinging, itching, irritation, dryness, redness, acne, folliculitis, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic contact dermatitis, skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, glaucoma, cataracts, HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, glaucoma, cataracts, HPA axis suppression.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), skin infections (secondary to immunosuppression).



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to diflorasone diacetate or any component of the formulation. Underlying skin infections (viral, bacterial, fungal) in the area to be treated. Rosacea, perioral dermatitis. Ophthalmic use.


## **Drug Interactions**

Limited information on clinically significant drug interactions is available. It is possible that it can increase glucose levels. Avoid concomitant use of other topical medications on the same area unless directed by a physician.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category C. Use only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is unknown if diflorasone diacetate is excreted in breast milk. Exercise caution when administering to breastfeeding mothers.
