## **Usage**

- Dill oil is traditionally used for digestive issues, particularly in infants and children to relieve gas, bloating, and colic.  It's also used for menstrual cramps. Some sources suggest it may be helpful for insomnia and respiratory infections.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Carminative, antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dill oil's active components (carvone, limonene, and anethole) relax the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract, reducing gas and bloating. It may also have mild anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects.

## **Alternate Names**

- Dill Seed Oil
- Dill Weed Oil
- Indian Dill (_Anethum sowa_)
- European Dill (_Anethum graveolens_)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dill oil relaxes the smooth muscles of the GI tract, reducing spasms and gas formation.  It may also act as a mild anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial agent.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Limited information is available on the pharmacokinetics of dill oil. Absorption, metabolism, and excretion details are not well-established.  It can be ingested orally or applied topically.
- **Mode of Action:** The carvone, limonene, and anethole in dill oil are thought to primarily affect smooth muscle in the gut. It is unclear if this is due to direct interaction with receptors, enzymes, or other cellular mechanisms.  Specific molecular interactions, including receptor binding or enzyme inhibition, are not well-defined.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Elimination pathways have not been extensively studied.

## **Dosage**

Dill oil dosage information is limited and varies.  Always consult with a healthcare professional for personalized recommendations.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 0.05-0.2 ml once or twice daily (oral or topical). A standardized adult dosage isn't well-established.

#### **Children:**

- Dosage must be determined by a healthcare professional based on age and weight.  It's generally lower than adult doses. Dr. Vamis Gripe Water (containing dill oil, sodium bicarbonate, and fennel oil) recommends: 1-6 months old: one 5ml spoonful; 6-12 months old: two 5ml spoonfuls; Under one month: not to be used.  These doses can be given after each feed, up to six times in 24 hours.  Dillengo syrup (containing dill oil and sodium bicarbonate) dosing recommendations: Adults and children over 12 years: 10ml-20ml every 4 to 6 hours as needed; children 6-12 years: 5ml to 10ml every 4-6 hours as needed; children under 6 years: 2.5ml to 5ml every 4-6 hours as needed. For TumsUp drops, containing simethicone, dill oil, and fennel oil, the concentration is simethicone 40mg, dill oil 0.005ml, and fennel oil 0.0007ml per ml of solution.  For children less than 2 years old, simethicone dosing is 20 mg orally after meals and at bedtime as needed, with a maximum of 240mg daily; children over 2 years old: 40mg orally after meals and at bedtime as needed, with a maximum of 480mg daily.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Insufficient data. Start with a lower dose and monitor carefully.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be needed. Consult a physician.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustments may be needed. Consult a physician.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution in patients with diabetes (dill oil may lower blood sugar), hypothyroidism (it might reduce thyroid levels), or those taking lithium (dill oil may decrease lithium excretion).  Avoid dill oil two weeks before surgery as it may interfere with blood sugar control.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- There aren't established dosage guidelines for specific clinical settings like intubation, surgery, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Consult a physician for adjustments based on renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Skin irritation (topical use)
- Increased sun sensitivity (topical use)
- Allergic reactions (especially in individuals allergic to plants in the carrot family)
- Bloating, heartburn, dizziness, diarrhea, constipation

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Severe allergic reactions
- Vomiting, diarrhea, itchy mouth, swollen red bumps on the tongue, throat swelling.


### **Long-Term Effects**

- Not well-established.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe allergic reactions requiring urgent medical attention


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to dill or any component of the product.
- Pregnancy (dill seed can stimulate menstruation and potentially lead to miscarriage).
- Fructose intolerance or glucose-galactose malabsorption (some formulations may contain sugars)


## **Drug Interactions**

- **Lithium:** Dill oil may decrease lithium excretion, leading to increased lithium levels and potential toxicity.
- **Diabetes Medications:** Dill oil might lower blood sugar, potentially causing hypoglycemia when combined with antidiabetic drugs.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Possibly unsafe. Dill seed may induce menstruation, leading to a risk of miscarriage.  Avoid dill pills or extracts during pregnancy due to limited safety research.
- **Breastfeeding:** Insufficient reliable information. Stick to food amounts.
