## **Usage**

Dimethindene is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of itching associated with various allergic reactions, including:

* **Urticaria (hives):** A skin rash triggered by allergens, characterized by raised, itchy welts.
* **Allergic rhinitis:** Inflammation of the nasal passages due to allergens, causing sneezing, runny nose, and itching.  This includes hay fever (seasonal allergic rhinitis) and perennial rhinitis (year-round allergic rhinitis).
* **Drug and food allergies:**  Hypersensitivity reactions to specific drugs or foods.
* **Atopic dermatitis (eczema):** A chronic inflammatory skin condition causing itching, redness, and dryness.
* **Pruritus:** Itching associated with skin eruptions like chickenpox.
* **Insect bites:** Localized reactions causing itching and swelling.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Dimethindene is classified as a first-generation antihistamine, antipruritic, and anticholinergic agent.

**Mechanism of Action:**  Dimethindene acts as a selective histamine H1 receptor antagonist. It competitively binds to H1 receptors, preventing histamine from binding and triggering allergic reactions. This inhibition reduces capillary permeability, thereby decreasing itching, swelling, and redness.

## **Alternate Names**

Dimethindene is also known as dimethindene maleate.  A popular brand name is Fenistil.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Dimethindene exerts its antihistaminic effect by blocking the action of histamine at H1 receptors.  Its anticholinergic properties contribute to drying effects, such as reduced mucus secretion.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Dimethindene is well-absorbed after oral administration.
* **Metabolism:** It is primarily metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation and methoxylation.
* **Elimination:**  Dimethindene and its metabolites are excreted primarily through the kidneys, with a half-life ranging from 4 to 6 hours. The half-life may be prolonged in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

**Mode of Action:** Dimethindene competitively binds to H1 receptors, blocking the binding of histamine. This inhibits histamine-mediated vasodilation, capillary permeability, and smooth muscle contraction, thus relieving allergy symptoms.

**Receptor Binding:** Selective H1 receptor antagonist.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion. Hepatic metabolism by CYP450 enzymes, specifically CYP2D6 and CYP2C19.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Oral: 1-2 mg three times a day.  Drops: 20-40 drops three times per day.  For patients prone to drowsiness, 40 drops before bedtime and 20 drops in the morning is recommended.
Topical: Apply gel or lotion to the affected area as needed, up to three times a day.

#### **Children:**

Oral drops: 0.1 mg/kg body weight per day, divided into three doses (2 drops/kg body weight/day). Adjust dosage based on age and weight:

* 1 month to 1 year:  Use with caution and only under medical supervision.
* 1-3 years (15-22.5 kg): 10-15 drops three times a day.
* 3-12 years (22.5-30 kg): 15-20 drops three times a day.

Note:  20 drops = 1 mL = 1 mg dimethindene maleate. 1 drop = 0.05 mg dimethindene maleate.


Topical:  Avoid large surface area application in children under 2 years old, especially on broken or inflamed skin. Use with caution in children under 2.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Initiate with a lower dose and titrate cautiously due to increased sensitivity to anticholinergic effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution in patients with glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, urinary retention, bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or seizures.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dimethindene is not typically used for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use. Emergency situations are usually treated with other medications.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Modify dosage based on individual patient factors such as renal/hepatic impairment, age, and other medical conditions. Consult specialized resources for detailed recommendations.

## **Side Effects**

* Paradoxical CNS stimulation (especially in children), including excitability, hallucinations, and seizures
* Difficulty urinating
* Blurred vision


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Tolerance to the sedative effects may develop with prolonged use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis),  significant CNS depression, cardiac arrhythmias.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to dimethindene or any of its components.
* Infants under one month old, particularly premature infants.
* Narrow-angle glaucoma.

* Paralytic ileus.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Anticholinergic drugs:** Additive anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention).
* **MAOIs:** Enhanced antihistaminic effects.
* **Other antihistamines or decongestants:** Additive effects and increased side effects.
* **CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 inhibitors or inducers:**  Altered dimethindene metabolism.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Use only if clearly needed. Avoid use on extensive skin surfaces, especially if excoriated or inflamed. Do not apply to nipples during breastfeeding.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Dimethindene is likely excreted in breast milk. Not recommended during breastfeeding.
