## **Usage**

- Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of constipation, including chronic constipation. It softens hard, dry stools to ease defecation and reduce straining. It's also used as an adjunct in abdominal radiological procedures and to ease defecation in patients with hemorrhoids or anal fissures.  
- **Pharmacological classification:** Laxative, stool softener (emollient laxative).
- **Mechanism of action:**  Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate is a surfactant. It lowers the surface tension at the oil-water interface of the feces, allowing water and lipids to penetrate the stool, thus softening it. It may also inhibit fluid absorption or stimulate secretion in the jejunum of the small intestine.


## **Alternate Names**

- Docusate sodium
- Dioctyl sulfosuccinate
- DOSS
- DSS
- **Brand Names:** Colace, Dulcolax Stool Softener, Diocto, Correctol, and many others. (Note: Brand names can vary regionally).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate softens stool by facilitating the mixture of fat and water in the intestinal contents.  This reduces strain during defecation.  Onset of action is typically 12-72 hours.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Minimally absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. After oral administration, the portion that is absorbed undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism and is excreted in the bile.  A small amount of absorbed drug is excreted in the urine.
- **Mode of action:**  Surface-active agent (surfactant) that increases the incorporation of water and fats into the stool.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Not applicable. The action of docusate sodium is primarily physicochemical.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily biliary excretion after hepatic metabolism. A small amount might be eliminated in urine.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 50 to 500 mg/day orally in divided doses. Start with higher doses and titrate down as needed.

#### **Children:**

- Less than 3 years: 10 to 40 mg/day (docusate sodium) orally, divided into 1 to 4 doses.
- 3 to 6 years: 20 to 60 mg/day (docusate sodium) orally, divided into 1 to 4 doses.
- 6 to 12 years: 40 to 150 mg/day (docusate sodium) orally, divided into 1 to 4 doses.
- Over 12 years: 50 to 400 mg/day (using any salt form) orally, divided into 1 to 4 doses.
- Rectal: 3 to 18 years: 50 to 100 mg (docusate sodium liquid) in a retention or flushing enema once daily. Alternatively, 200 to 283 mg rectally as an enema once daily.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Same as adult dosing. Monitor for dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustments. Monitor closely.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments. Monitor closely.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with heart conditions or those on a low-sodium diet.
