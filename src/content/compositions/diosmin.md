## **Usage**

- Diosmin is primarily prescribed for the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) and acute hemorrhoidal attacks.  CVI is a condition affecting the veins in the legs, causing symptoms such as swelling, pain, leg heaviness, and cramps. Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the anus and rectum that can cause pain, itching, and bleeding.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Phlebotonic, Vasoprotective.  Phlebotonics are agents that improve venous tone, while vasoprotectives protect blood vessels.
- **Mechanism of action:** Diosmin increases venous tone and reduces venous capacitance and distensibility, thereby improving venous return. It also improves lymphatic drainage, reduces capillary permeability and fragility, and exhibits anti-inflammatory effects.

## **Alternate Names**

- Diosmine
- Brand names: Daflon 500, Detralex, DiosVein, Diosmed.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Diosmin enhances venous tone by increasing the frequency and reducing the duration of venous contractions, leading to improved venous return.  It decreases capillary permeability and fragility, thereby reducing edema formation.  It also possesses anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Diosmin is generally administered orally, often in combination with hesperidin (micronized purified flavonoid fraction, or MPFF). Following oral ingestion, diosmin is rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolized in the body. The primary metabolic pathway involves deglycosylation to diosmetin, which is further degraded to phenolic acids. These metabolites are eliminated in urine and feces. The predominant metabolite is 3-hydroxy-phenylpropionic acid, primarily excreted in its conjugated form.  Elimination of diosmin is relatively rapid.
- **Mode of action at the cellular level**:  Diosmin acts on the venous smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, enhancing their function and contributing to improved venous tone and reduced capillary permeability.
- **Receptor binding/enzyme inhibition**: The precise molecular mechanisms underlying the actions of diosmin are not fully elucidated.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Chronic Venous Insufficiency:** 1000 mg daily (either as 500 mg twice daily or 1000 mg once daily) with meals.
- **Acute Hemorrhoidal Attack:** Initially, 3000 mg daily (divided into two or three doses) with meals for 4 days, followed by 2000 mg daily (divided into two doses) with meals for 3 days.


#### **Children:**

- The safety and efficacy of diosmin have not been established in children and adolescents under 18 years old.  Use is not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required. However, start with the lowest effective dose and monitor for side effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended, but monitor patients closely.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended, but monitor patients closely.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use cautiously in patients with bleeding disorders, as diosmin may slow blood clotting.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Diosmin is primarily used for CVI and hemorrhoidal attacks.  It is not typically used in the context of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, bleeding disorders, and concomitant use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications.

- **Antihistamines (e.g., fexofenadine):** Diosmin may increase the absorption of certain antihistamines.
- **Anticonvulsants (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin):** Diosmin may decrease the metabolism of these medications.
- **Muscle Relaxants (e.g., chlorzoxazone):** Diosmin may decrease the metabolism of certain muscle relaxants.
- **Herbal supplements (e.g., garlic, ginger, ginkgo, ginseng, turmeric, fenugreek, feverfew):** These supplements may interact with diosmin's blood-thinning properties.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  There is insufficient data to determine the safety of diosmin during pregnancy.  Avoid use.
