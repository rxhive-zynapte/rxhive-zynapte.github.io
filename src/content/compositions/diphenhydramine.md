## **Usage**

Diphenhydramine is primarily used to treat allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, pruritus), cold and flu symptoms (rhinorrhea, sneezing, cough), motion sickness, and insomnia. It can also be utilized for Parkinsonism and dystonic reactions.  Its pharmacological classifications include:

* **Antihistamine:**  Specifically, a first-generation H1 receptor antagonist.
* **Antimuscarinic:**  Exhibits anticholinergic properties.
* **Antiparkinsonian:**  Can be used to manage some symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
* **Sedative/Hypnotic:** Induces drowsiness and promotes sleep.
* **Local Anesthetic:** Can provide local pain relief.

**Mechanism of Action:** Primarily, diphenhydramine competitively antagonizes the H1 histamine receptor.  It also possesses antimuscarinic (anticholinergic) activity and acts as a sodium channel blocker, contributing to its diverse effects.

## **Alternate Names**

While "diphenhydramine" is the generic name, it is also known by a variety of brand names such as:

* **Benadryl** (most common)
* **Sominex**
* **Nytol**
* **Compoz**
* **Unisom SleepTabs** (combination product)
* And many others

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Diphenhydramine's primary action is as an inverse agonist at the H1 histamine receptor. By blocking histamine's actions, it reduces allergic symptoms like vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, bronchoconstriction, and itching.  The antimuscarinic effects contribute to the drying of secretions, reduced gastrointestinal motility, and potential cognitive effects.  Sodium channel blockade results in local anesthetic properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Diphenhydramine is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 1-4 hours. IM and IV administration have rapid onset of action.
* **Metabolism:**  Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily via CYP2D6.
* **Elimination:**  Excreted primarily in the urine, with a half-life of 4-8 hours (longer in elderly patients and those with hepatic impairment).

**Mode of Action:** Diphenhydramine competitively binds to the H1 receptor, preventing histamine from binding and initiating its downstream effects.  It similarly competes at muscarinic receptors.  It also blocks sodium channels, though this is less prominent at typical doses.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** H1 receptor inverse agonist, muscarinic receptor antagonist.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of metabolites; hepatic metabolism by CYP2D6.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral:** 25-50 mg every 4-6 hours as needed. Maximum daily dose: 300 mg.
* **IM/IV:** 10-50 mg every 4-6 hours as needed. Maximum daily dose: 400 mg. Administer IV at a rate not exceeding 25 mg/minute.

#### **Children:**

* **Oral/IM/IV:**  Dosages based on weight (1-2 mg/kg/dose) or age:
    * 2-5 years: 6.25 mg every 4-6 hours as needed, max 37.5 mg/day
    * 6-11 years: 12.5-25 mg every 4-6 hours as needed, max 150 mg/day
    * 12+ years: Adult dosing
* **Pediatric Safety:** Avoid use in neonates and infants under 2 years unless specifically directed by a physician.  Use caution in young children due to increased risk of paradoxical excitation and other adverse effects.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and titrate carefully due to increased sensitivity and risk of adverse effects (confusion, dry mouth, constipation, etc.).
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be necessary based on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Reduce the dose and monitor closely for adverse events.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, etc.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Intubation:** Not routinely used for intubation.
* **Surgical Procedures:** Can be used as a local anesthetic (1% solution).
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** Used off-label for sedation, but not recommended as a first-line agent.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** May be used for sedation, but not routinely.
* **Emergency Situations (e.g., anaphylaxis):**  25-50 mg IV/IM, may repeat as needed. Epinephrine is first-line treatment.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Adjustments required for renal/hepatic impairment and for patients with specific comorbidities.

## **Side Effects**
