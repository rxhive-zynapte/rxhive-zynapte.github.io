## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Diphenylpyraline is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of allergic conditions such as allergic rhinitis (hay fever), allergic conjunctivitis, allergic dermatoses, pruritus (itching), urticaria (hives), and insect bites and stings.  It may also be present in cough syrups to provide relief from cough.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antihistamine (H1 receptor antagonist).  Also possesses anticholinergic and sedative properties.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Diphenylpyraline competes with histamine for H1 receptor sites on effector cells, thus reducing the effects of histamine and providing temporary relief from allergy symptoms.  Its anticholinergic activity contributes to a drying effect on the nasal mucosa.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:** Piprinhydrinate (as diphenylpyraline teoclate).
- **Brand Names:** Solphyllex, Actophlem Cough Syrup (India); various other combination cold and cough medications internationally.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Diphenylpyraline binds to and blocks the H1 histamine receptors, preventing histamine from exerting its effects.  This leads to a reduction in vascular permeability, smooth muscle contraction, and mucus secretion.  The anticholinergic effect contributes to drying of secretions.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Diphenylpyraline is readily absorbed after oral administration.  Onset of action is typically within 15-30 minutes, with peak effects within 1-2 hours. Duration of action can last up to 6 hours. Metabolism is primarily hepatic, and elimination is mainly through renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** Competitive antagonism at the H1 histamine receptor.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Binds to H1 histamine receptors, indirectly affecting levels of dopamine and acetylcholine.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism, followed by renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 10-20 mg, two to four times daily (up to a maximum of 6 mg per day in some regions).

#### **Children:**

- Dose adjusted according to body weight (e.g., 1.25 mg per kg of body weight daily in divided doses).  Use with caution, as children may be more sensitive to the effects of this drug.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Start with lower doses due to increased risk of side effects, especially drowsiness and confusion.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment necessary based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, asthma, or thyroid disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases:**

Dosing information for specific clinical use cases such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations is not available in the provided sources.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Modify dosage based on patient-specific factors like renal/hepatic dysfunction, age, and other comorbid conditions.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Drowsiness
- Dizziness
- Dry mouth
- Blurred vision
- Constipation
- Urinary retention
- Headache
- Fatigue

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Confusion
- Seizures
- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
- Tachycardia or palpitations
- Hypotension

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Information about potential long-term effects with chronic use is not readily available.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, seizures, significant cardiovascular effects (tachycardia, hypotension).


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to diphenylpyraline
- Severe liver disease
- Narrow-angle glaucoma
- Urinary retention
- Prostatic hypertrophy
- Pyloroduodenal obstruction
- Epilepsy

## **Drug Interactions**

- **CNS depressants:** (alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opioid analgesics): Enhanced sedation.
- **Anticholinergic drugs:** (antidepressants, antipsychotics, gastrointestinal medications): Increased anticholinergic effects.
- **MAOIs:** Intensified anticholinergic and CNS depressant effects.
- **Other:** Aminoglycosides (masking of ototoxicity), betahistine (antagonism), bupropion (increased seizure risk), mefloquine (QT prolongation).

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use only if clearly needed and under close medical supervision, as safety during pregnancy and lactation hasn't been fully established. Potential for fetal risks and excretion in breast milk.

## **Drug Profile Summary**
