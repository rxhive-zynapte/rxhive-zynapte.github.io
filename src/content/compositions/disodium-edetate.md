## **Usage**

- Disodium edetate is prescribed for the treatment of hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels) and for controlling heart rhythm disturbances caused by digitalis toxicity (e.g., digoxin overdose). It is also used for lead poisoning, removing toxic and radioactive metals, and digitalis-induced cardiac arrhythmias.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Chelating agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Disodium edetate acts by chelating (binding to) divalent and trivalent metal ions, such as calcium, lead, zinc, and magnesium. This forms stable, water-soluble complexes that are then excreted by the kidneys, effectively lowering the concentration of these ions in the blood.

## **Alternate Names**

- Disodium EDTA
- EDTA disodium salt
- Edetate disodium salt dihydrate
- Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt dihydrate
- Disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate dihydrate
- EDTA-Na₂
- Edathamil
- Sequestrene Na₂
- **Brand Names:** Disotate, Endrate (discontinued)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Disodium edetate lowers blood calcium levels by forming stable complexes with calcium ions, which are then excreted renally. It also chelates other metal ions like lead, zinc, and magnesium.  In cases of digitalis toxicity, it can help restore normal heart rhythm by reducing calcium-mediated effects on cardiac muscle.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Administered intravenously. Disodium EDTA is primarily eliminated through renal excretion, with minimal hepatic metabolism. The chelated complexes are rapidly cleared by glomerular filtration.
- **Mode of Action:** Binds divalent and trivalent cations, forming stable, water-soluble complexes. This reduces their free concentration and facilitates their excretion.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Disodium edetate primarily acts through chelation rather than receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion as chelates.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 50 mg/kg/day up to a maximum of 3 g in 24 hours, administered by slow intravenous infusion over 3-4 hours. A common regimen is 5 consecutive daily doses, followed by 2 days without medication, repeated as needed up to a total of 15 doses.


#### **Children:**

- 40 mg/kg/day (1 g per 25 kg) up to a maximum of 70 mg/kg/24 hours. Dilute in a sufficient volume of 5% Dextrose Injection or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection to a final concentration not exceeding 3%. Administer by slow intravenous infusion over 3-4 hours. 
- **Pediatric Safety Considerations:** Closely monitor renal function. Avoid rapid IV infusions, especially in lead encephalopathy.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Adjust dose based on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce dosage based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, though minimal hepatic metabolism occurs.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor closely in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and electrolyte imbalances.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing guidelines based on the specific clinical scenario and overseen by a physician. Similar dosages to the standard dosage recommendations may be used.

- **Intubation:** No specific dosing recommendations for intubation procedures.
- **Surgical Procedures:** No specific dosing recommendations.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** No specific dosing recommendations.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary depending on the clinical picture and organ function.
- **Emergency Situations:** Doses up to 75 mg/kg/day (not exceeding 1g/24 hours) may be used in severely symptomatic patients.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Renal impairment necessitates dose reduction based on creatinine clearance.
