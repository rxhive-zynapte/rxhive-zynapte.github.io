## **Usage**

Disopyramide is prescribed for the treatment of certain types of serious (potentially fatal) irregular heartbeats, primarily ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia, and for maintaining normal heart rhythm after procedures like electroconversion for atrial fibrillation or flutter. Its pharmacological classification is antiarrhythmic (Class IA).  Disopyramide works by blocking sodium channels in the heart muscle, slowing the conduction of electrical impulses and prolonging the refractory period, thus stabilizing the heart rhythm.

## **Alternate Names**

Disopyramide phosphate (salt form used in formulations)
Brand names include Norpace®, Norpace CR®.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Disopyramide decreases the rate of depolarization in cardiac tissues by blocking fast sodium channels, prolonging the action potential duration and effective refractory period. It also has antimuscarinic (anticholinergic) properties which contribute to its antiarrhythmic action but causes many of the adverse side effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:** Well-absorbed orally.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by the liver, with a portion excreted unchanged in the urine.
* **Elimination:** Both renal and hepatic pathways. Primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism by CYP3A4, with a small portion excreted unchanged in the urine.

**Mode of Action:**  Disopyramide binds to and blocks fast sodium channels in the heart, reducing the inward sodium current, slowing down the rapid depolarization phase of the action potential. It prolongs the action potential duration and the effective refractory period, helping to stabilize the heart rhythm. The drug also has anticholinergic effects, blocking the effects of acetylcholine, which can further impact heart rate and rhythm.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Immediate-release:** 100-150 mg every 6 hours, total daily dose 400-800 mg. Patients weighing less than 50 kg may receive a lower dose (400 mg/day divided every 6 hours).

* **Extended-release:** 200-300 mg every 12 hours, total daily dose 400-800 mg. It is not recommended for rapid control of arrhythmias.


#### **Children:**

Disopyramide is generally not recommended for use in children under 18 years old. Safety and efficacy have not been established. Some limited data suggest a starting dose of 10-30 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours for children under 1 year old and adjusted based on age for older children. However, expert consultation is crucial for pediatric use.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Lower starting doses are recommended due to potential reduced renal and hepatic function. Dose adjustments should be made cautiously.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are essential.
    * CrCl >40 mL/min: Standard dosing
    * CrCl 30-40 mL/min: Administer every 8 hours.
    * CrCl 15-30 mL/min: Administer every 12 hours.
    * CrCl <15 mL/min: Administer once daily.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Reduced doses are recommended (e.g., 100 mg every 6 hours for immediate release or 200 mg every 12 hours for extended release). 

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution should be used in patients with heart failure, glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, urinary retention, or prostatic hypertrophy. Dosage adjustments may be needed.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Disopyramide's standard dosing is generally employed for indicated arrhythmias, whether occurring post-myocardial infarction, post-electroconversion, or in other settings. There is some indication for its use to suppress arrhythmias during surgical procedures, but specific dosage guidelines for these cases must be tailored to the individual patient's needs and clinical status. Please refer to standard dosage section for more information.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Disopyramide should be administered with caution, usually at the lower end of the dosing range in elderly patients, and closely monitored. Dose adjustments are usually needed when treating patients with hepatic or renal impairment.
