## Usage

- **Medical Conditions:** Disulfiram is prescribed as an adjunctive treatment for chronic alcohol dependence (alcohol use disorder).  It's important to note that disulfiram is not a cure for alcoholism, but it acts as a deterrent to discourage alcohol consumption.  It works by causing unpleasant side effects if alcohol is ingested.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Alcohol deterrent, enzyme inhibitor (aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Disulfiram inhibits the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, which is involved in the metabolism of alcohol. This inhibition leads to a buildup of acetaldehyde in the body, causing a range of unpleasant effects when alcohol is consumed, thus discouraging further drinking.  These effects typically occur within 10-30 minutes of alcohol ingestion.

## Alternate Names

- **Generic Name:** Disulfiram
- **Brand Name:** Antabuse (Note: Antabuse brand is discontinued in some regions).


## How It Works

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Disulfiram's primary effect is the inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase. This leads to an accumulation of acetaldehyde, a toxic byproduct of alcohol metabolism, when alcohol is consumed. The elevated acetaldehyde levels produce the disulfiram-alcohol reaction (DER), characterized by a range of adverse effects including flushing, throbbing headache, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, difficulty breathing, weakness, blurred vision, mental confusion, sweating, choking, and anxiety. These unpleasant effects are intended to create an aversion to alcohol.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Disulfiram is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
    - **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily to diethyldithiocarbamate, which is further metabolized.  CYP450 enzymes play a role in disulfiram's metabolism, leading to potential drug interactions.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily excreted in the urine as metabolites and a small amount in the feces and through the lungs. It can take several days to completely eliminate the drug and its metabolites from the body.
- **Mode of Action:**  Disulfiram irreversibly inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, Neurotransmitter Modulation:** The primary mechanism is enzyme inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion as metabolites. Some elimination also occurs via feces and lungs.

## Dosage

### Standard Dosage

#### Adults:

- **Initial Dosage:**  500 mg orally once daily for 1-2 weeks.
- **Maintenance Dosage:**  125-500 mg orally once daily (250 mg is the average maintenance dose).
- **Maximum Dosage:** Do not exceed 500 mg daily.
- **Duration:** Treatment can continue for months or even years, depending on the patient's response and the integrated treatment plan.

#### Children:

- Disulfiram is generally not recommended for use in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients.


#### Special Cases:

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and titrate cautiously, considering age-related decline in hepatic and renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; dose adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with extreme caution. Disulfiram is extensively metabolized by the liver, and liver disease can increase the risk of adverse effects. Some guidelines recommend avoiding disulfiram in patients with any degree of liver disease.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Disulfiram may be used with caution in patients with certain comorbid conditions, such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, epilepsy, seizures, or cardiovascular disease, under strict medical supervision. However, it is contraindicated in patients with severe myocardial disease, coronary occlusion, or psychosis.

### Clinical Use Cases

Disulfiram is specifically indicated for the adjunctive treatment of chronic alcohol dependence as part of a comprehensive treatment program. It's not typically used in acute medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### Dosage Adjustments

Dosage adjustments may be needed based on patient response, tolerance, and the presence of hepatic or renal impairment.


## Side Effects

### Common Side Effects

- Drowsiness
- Fatigue
- Headache
- Metallic or garlic-like taste in mouth
- Skin rash

### Rare but Serious Side Effects

- Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
- Optic neuritis
- Peripheral neuropathy
- Psychotic reactions (hallucinations, delusions)

### Long-Term Effects

- Chronic liver disease (with prolonged use)
- Peripheral neuropathy (with prolonged use)

### Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)

- Severe disulfiram-alcohol reaction (DER) (flushing, throbbing headache, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, difficulty breathing, weakness, blurred vision, mental confusion, sweating, choking, and anxiety)
- Hepatotoxicity
- Psychotic reactions


## Contraindications

- **Absolute:** Severe myocardial disease, coronary occlusion, psychosis, hypersensitivity to disulfiram or thiuram derivatives, concomitant or recent use of metronidazole, paraldehyde, or alcohol.
- **Relative:**  Liver disease (generally avoid use), diabetes, hypothyroidism, epilepsy, seizures, cardiovascular disease, pregnancy (use only if benefits clearly outweigh risks), breastfeeding (not recommended).

## Drug Interactions

- **Alcohol:**  Causes the disulfiram-alcohol reaction. Avoid all sources of alcohol, including medications containing alcohol, foods prepared with alcohol, and even topical products containing alcohol.
- **Metronidazole, Paraldehyde:** Can potentiate the disulfiram-alcohol reaction even in the absence of alcohol consumption.
- **Warfarin and other anticoagulants:**  Disulfiram may increase the anticoagulant effects of warfarin and other anticoagulants.
- **Phenytoin:**  Disulfiram may increase phenytoin levels.
- **Isoniazid:** May increase the risk of neurotoxicity.
- **Many other drug interactions:** Consult a comprehensive drug interaction resource before prescribing or dispensing disulfiram.


## Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  C (Animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks.) There are reports of birth defects, but the causal relationship is unclear. Disulfiram is generally avoided during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. Use only if potential benefits outweigh the risks.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Disulfiram may be excreted in breast milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking disulfiram.

## Drug Profile Summary
