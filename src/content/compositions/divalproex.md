## Usage

Divalproex sodium is an anticonvulsant medication prescribed for the treatment of various conditions:

*   **Epilepsy:**  Used to manage several types of seizures, including complex partial seizures, absence seizures, and tonic-clonic seizures, both as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy.
*   **Bipolar Disorder:** Effective in treating acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder, even with psychotic features.
*   **Migraine Prophylaxis:**  Prescribed for the prevention of migraine headaches.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Anticonvulsant, Mood Stabilizer

**Mechanism of Action:** Divalproex increases the concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter, in the brain. It achieves this by inhibiting GABA transaminase, the enzyme responsible for breaking down GABA. This action results in enhanced GABAergic inhibition, which helps stabilize neuronal excitability and prevent seizures. It may also modulate voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels.



## Alternate Names

*   **Valproic Acid** (closely related compound)
*   **Sodium Valproate** (component of Divalproex)

**Brand Names:** Depakote, Depakote ER, Depakote Sprinkles, Epival



## How It Works

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Divalproex exerts its anticonvulsant effects by enhancing GABAergic inhibition in the central nervous system (CNS). This reduces neuronal excitability and stabilizes nerve cell activity, preventing seizures. It also appears to have some effects on sodium and calcium channels, further contributing to its anticonvulsant properties. Its mood stabilizing effects likely involve similar mechanisms, although the precise nature remains incompletely understood.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Well-absorbed orally.  Delayed-release and extended-release formulations alter absorption rate, providing more sustained levels.
*   **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily through glucuronidation and beta-oxidation.  CYP2C9 plays a minor role.  
*   **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated renally, with a small portion excreted in feces.

**Mode of Action:** Divalproex increases GABA levels by inhibiting GABA transaminase, the enzyme that degrades GABA.  This leads to increased GABA in the synaptic cleft, augmenting inhibitory neurotransmission. It may also modulate voltage-gated sodium channels, reducing neuronal excitability.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Inhibits GABA transaminase, potentially interacts with sodium and calcium channels.

**Elimination Pathways:** Renal excretion (as glucuronide conjugates and metabolites), minor fecal excretion.



## Dosage



### Standard Dosage

#### Adults:

*   **Epilepsy:** Initial dose is 10-15 mg/kg/day, divided into 2-4 doses. Increase weekly by 5-10 mg/kg/day until seizures are controlled or side effects limit further increase. Maximum dose: 60 mg/kg/day.
*   **Mania:** Initial dose (delayed-release): 750 mg/day divided into smaller doses. Initial dose (extended-release): 25 mg/kg/day once daily.  Increase rapidly as needed. Maximum dose: 60 mg/kg/day.
*   **Migraine Prophylaxis:** Initial dose (delayed-release): 250 mg twice daily. Initial dose (extended-release): 500 mg once daily. Increase as needed. Maximum dose: 1000 mg/day.

#### Children:

*   **Epilepsy:** Similar to adults, starting with 10-15 mg/kg/day.  Dose adjustments are weight-based. Maximum dose: 60 mg/kg/day. Use with caution in children younger than 2 years due to increased risk of hepatotoxicity.
*   **Mania:** Efficacy and safety not well established in children under 18.

#### Special Cases:

*   **Elderly Patients:** Lower starting dose and slower titration due to increased sensitivity to adverse effects, particularly somnolence. Monitor for dehydration and nutritional status.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Monitor closely; dosage adjustments may be necessary due to reduced protein binding and potentially inaccurate total valproate concentration measurements.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment. Use lower doses with caution in mild to moderate impairment and monitor liver function tests (LFTs) closely.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution in patients with metabolic disorders (e.g., urea cycle disorders), bleeding problems, and mitochondrial disorders.


### Clinical Use Cases:

Dosing in these settings generally follows standard recommendations, with careful titration based on patient response and tolerance.

*   **Intubation:** No specific dosage adjustments.
*   **Surgical Procedures:** No specific dosage adjustments.
*   **Mechanical Ventilation:** No specific dosage adjustments.
*   **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** No specific dosage adjustments.
*   **Emergency Situations:** For status epilepticus, intravenous (IV) administration of valproate (not divalproex) may be used.

### Dosage Adjustments

Dosage should be individualized based on patient-specific factors, including:

*   Renal function
*   Hepatic function
*   Concomitant medications
*   Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for epilepsy and mania to maintain valproate serum levels within therapeutic range.


## Side Effects

### Common Side Effects

Nausea, vomiting, tremor, dizziness, somnolence, weight gain, hair loss, diarrhea.

### Rare but Serious Side Effects

Hepatotoxicity (especially in young children and those with mitochondrial disorders), pancreatitis, hyperammonemic encephalopathy, thrombocytopenia, suicidal ideation, multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions.

### Long-Term Effects

Weight gain, hair thinning, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), osteoporosis.

### Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)

Hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, severe thrombocytopenia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hyperammonemia, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS).



## Contraindications

*   Hypersensitivity to divalproex or valproic acid
*   Hepatic disease or significant hepatic dysfunction
*   Urea cycle disorders
*   Known or suspected mitochondrial disorders (especially POLG mutations), especially in children under 2.
*   Pregnancy (especially first trimester) for migraine prevention.



## Drug Interactions

Divalproex interacts with numerous medications. Key interactions include:

*   **CYP2C9 substrates:** Divalproex may inhibit CYP2C9 metabolism of drugs like warfarin, increasing their levels and risk of bleeding.
*   **Enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine):** May decrease divalproex levels.
*   **Other anticonvulsants (e.g., lamotrigine, felbamate):** Divalproex can increase levels of these medications.
*   **Aspirin:** May increase valproate levels.
*   **Carbapenem antibiotics:** May decrease valproate levels.



## Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

*   **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  D (high risk of fetal harm). Divalproex is contraindicated in pregnancy, especially the first trimester, due to a significant risk of neural tube defects (e.g., spina bifida), other major congenital malformations, and developmental delays. If use is unavoidable during pregnancy, use the lowest effective dose and supplement with folic acid.
*   **Breastfeeding:**  Divalproex is excreted in breast milk. The decision to breastfeed should be made considering the potential benefits versus the risks to the infant. Monitor infants for adverse effects like thrombocytopenia.



## Drug Profile Summary

*   **Mechanism of Action:**  Increases GABA levels by inhibiting GABA transaminase.
*   **Side Effects:**  Nausea, vomiting, tremor, dizziness, weight gain, hair loss, hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, thrombocytopenia.
*   **Contraindications:** Liver disease, urea cycle disorders, mitochondrial disorders, hypersensitivity.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Warfarin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, aspirin, carbapenem antibiotics.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy for migraine prophylaxis; avoid in pregnancy for other uses unless benefits clearly outweigh risks. Excreted in breast milk.
