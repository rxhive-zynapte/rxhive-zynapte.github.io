## **Usage**

Dobutamine is prescribed for short-term management of heart failure and low cardiac output states such as those seen in cardiogenic or septic shock, and following cardiac surgery. It is also used in dobutamine stress echocardiography.

It is classified pharmacologically as an inotropic agent and also belongs to the class of medications called sympathomimetics.  

Dobutamine primarily stimulates beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, increasing myocardial contractility and stroke volume, thereby improving cardiac output. It has less effect on heart rate and peripheral vascular resistance than other inotropes like dopamine.


## **Alternate Names**

Dobutamine hydrochloride is the chemical name.  Brand names include Dobutrex.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Dobutamine's primary effect is to increase myocardial contractility (positive inotropy) by stimulating beta-1 receptors. It also exhibits some mild beta-2 and alpha-1 receptor activity, which can lead to vasodilation and some vasoconstriction, respectively.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Dobutamine is administered intravenously. It is rapidly metabolized in the liver and other tissues, primarily by conjugation and methylation by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). The elimination half-life is short (approximately 2 minutes). It is excreted in urine and feces. 

**Mode of Action:** Dobutamine acts on beta-1 adrenergic receptors on cardiac myocytes, increasing intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels.  This leads to enhanced calcium influx, stronger myocardial contraction, and increased stroke volume.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Dobutamine's primary action is beta-1 receptor agonism.


**Elimination Pathways:** Metabolism in the liver and other tissues; excretion in urine and feces.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Initial dose: 0.5-1 mcg/kg/min by continuous IV infusion.

Maintenance dose:  2-20 mcg/kg/min, titrated to desired hemodynamic response (blood pressure, heart rate, urine output, cardiac output, central venous pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure). Doses up to 40 mcg/kg/min may be necessary in some cases.

#### **Children:**

Initial dose: 0.5-1 mcg/kg/min by continuous IV infusion or 5 mcg/kg/min and titrated to 2-20 mcg/kg/min based on clinical response.

Maintenance dose: 2-20 mcg/kg/min, titrated to desired effect (up to a maximum of 40 mcg/kg/min). Closely monitor for potential adverse effects, particularly in neonates.



#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start at the lower end of the dose range and titrate cautiously due to increased sensitivity and potential for comorbidities.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustment is typically required as dobutamine is not significantly cleared by the kidneys. Titrate carefully based on clinical response.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** While some sources suggest no dosage adjustments are required, others suggest cautious use with close monitoring and titration as the drug is metabolized in the liver.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Exercise caution in patients with atrial fibrillation (control ventricular rate before starting dobutamine), hypertension, or severe coronary artery disease.




### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:** Dobutamine is used to support hemodynamics in these settings, particularly in patients with low cardiac output states. Dosing is titrated to individual patient needs based on hemodynamic monitoring.
* **Emergency Situations (e.g., cardiogenic shock):**  Dobutamine is titrated to effect, beginning at a low dose and increasing as needed to achieve hemodynamic stability.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on clinical response (heart rate, blood pressure, urine output, cardiac output, etc.). In obese patients, use ideal body weight for dose calculations.




## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, headache, phlebitis at the infusion site.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Hypotension, angina, serious arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia), hypokalemia, hypersensitivity reactions (rash, fever, bronchospasm).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Tachyphylaxis may develop with prolonged use (more than 72 hours), requiring dose increases.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe hypotension, life-threatening arrhythmias, anaphylaxis.



## **Contraindications**

Idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis, pheochromocytoma, hypersensitivity to dobutamine or sulfites. Uncorrected hypovolemia and tachyarrhythmias should be addressed before administering dobutamine.

## **Drug Interactions**

Beta-blockers may antagonize dobutamine's effects. Nitroprusside may increase cardiac output and decrease pulmonary capillary wedge pressure when used concomitantly. Ozanimod or Ponesimod should be avoided or used with caution due to potential for increased toxicity or pharmacodynamic synergism respectively.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Dobutamine is generally considered safe during pregnancy when the benefits outweigh the risks. Monitor fetal well-being. It is likely excreted in breast milk, therefore breastfeeding is generally not recommended while receiving dobutamine.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Beta-1 adrenergic receptor agonist, increasing cardiac contractility.
* **Side Effects:** Increased heart rate, blood pressure, arrhythmias, nausea, headache.
* **Contraindications:** IHSS, pheochromocytoma, hypersensitivity to dobutamine or sulfites.
* **Drug Interactions:** Beta-blockers, nitroprusside, ozanimod, ponesimod.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Generally safe in pregnancy if benefits outweigh risks; not recommended while breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** 0.5-40 mcg/kg/min IV infusion, titrated to effect.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Heart rate, blood pressure, urine output, cardiac output, central venous pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, ECG.



## **Popular Combinations**

Dobutamine may be used in combination with norepinephrine in patients with septic shock and cardiac dysfunction.


## **Precautions**

Correct hypovolemia before starting dobutamine. Careful titration is crucial, particularly in elderly patients and those with underlying cardiac conditions. Monitor closely for arrhythmias and hypotension.
