## **Usage**

Doripenem is a broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic indicated for the treatment of adults with the following infections:

*   **Nosocomial pneumonia** (including ventilator-associated pneumonia). *However, note increased mortality risk compared to other treatments (see Precautions).*
*   **Complicated intra-abdominal infections.**
*   **Complicated urinary tract infections** (including pyelonephritis).

**Pharmacological Classification:** Carbapenem Antibiotic

**Mechanism of Action:** Doripenem inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This leads to bacterial cell death.  It exhibits activity against a broad range of aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including *Pseudomonas aeruginosa.*


## **Alternate Names**

Doripenem is the generic name.

**Brand Name:** Doribax


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Doripenem exerts its bactericidal effect by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis through binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).  Specifically, it has high affinity for PBP-2 and PBP-3. This binding disrupts the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis, leading to cell wall instability and bacterial lysis.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Administered intravenously; thus, 100% bioavailability.
*   **Distribution:** Distributes widely into tissues and body fluids, including the lungs, ascitic fluid, and urine.  Approximately 8.1% protein binding.  Volume of distribution is similar to extracellular fluid volume.
*   **Metabolism:** Undergoes minimal metabolism by CYP450 enzymes.
*   **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated renally as unchanged drug, with a small amount excreted in the feces.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

500 mg every 8 hours via intravenous infusion over 1 hour.  For nosocomial pneumonia, a 4-hour infusion may be more appropriate for infections with less susceptible pathogens or in severe infections.

#### **Children:**

Doripenem is not recommended for use in children under 18 years old due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is necessary unless there is moderate to severe renal impairment.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary. See Dosage Adjustments below.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment is necessary.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions, history of seizures) for seizures during treatment.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosages for specific clinical use cases follow the standard adult dosage guidelines (500 mg every 8 hours intravenously over 1 hour) unless renal impairment necessitates adjustments.  For nosocomial pneumonia, particularly severe cases or those involving less susceptible pathogens might benefit from a 4-hour infusion.

*   Intubation
*   Surgical Procedures
*   Mechanical Ventilation
*   Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use
*   Emergency Situations

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Renal impairment requires dosage adjustments as follows:

*   **Mild Renal Impairment (CrCl 51-79 mL/min):** No dosage adjustment required.
*   **Moderate Renal Impairment (CrCl 30-50 mL/min):** 250 mg every 8 hours.
*   **Severe Renal Impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min):** 250 mg every 12 hours. Use with caution due to increased drug exposure.

*Doripenem is hemodialyzable; however, there are no established guidelines for dosage adjustment in patients on dialysis.  It is not recommended for use in patients receiving any form of dialysis.*


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Headache, nausea, diarrhea, rash, phlebitis/infusion site reactions (pain, redness, swelling).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Seizures (especially in patients with CNS disorders, renal impairment, or receiving higher doses), *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea (CDAD), allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), severe skin reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Potential for *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea that can occur up to two months after treatment discontinuation.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis.


## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to doripenem, other carbapenems, or beta-lactams.


## **Drug Interactions**

*   **Valproic Acid:** Doripenem significantly decreases valproic acid levels, increasing the risk of seizures. Avoid concomitant use or consider alternative anticonvulsants/antibacterials.
*   **Probenecid:** Probenecid reduces renal clearance of doripenem, increasing doripenem plasma concentrations. Avoid co-administration.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

*   **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Category B. Animal studies have not shown evidence of teratogenicity, but there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Use only if clearly needed and if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.
*   **Breastfeeding:** It is unknown if doripenem is excreted in human milk. Exercise caution when administering to breastfeeding women.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to PBPs.
*   **Side Effects:** Headache, nausea, diarrhea, rash, phlebitis; rarely, seizures, CDAD, allergic reactions.
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to doripenem, other carbapenems, or beta-lactams.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Valproic acid, probenecid.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category B; unknown if excreted in human milk. Use cautiously.
*   **Dosage:** Adults: 500 mg IV every 8 hours over 1 hour; adjustments required for renal impairment. Not recommended for children under 18.
*   **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function (especially in patients with renal impairment), signs of superinfection (e.g., CDAD), and neurological status (for seizures), hepatic function (monitor liver function tests).

## **Popular Combinations**

Information not available in the given sources.


## **Precautions**

*   **General Precautions:** Obtain cultures before starting therapy. Monitor for signs of hypersensitivity reactions and superinfections.
*   **Specific Populations:**  See Dosage and Pregnancy and Breastfeeding sections for details related to pregnant/breastfeeding women, children, and the elderly.
*   **Increased Mortality in Ventilator-Associated Bacterial Pneumonia:**  Doripenem use for ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) has been associated with increased mortality in clinical trials compared to other treatments.  Consider alternative therapies for VABP when possible.
