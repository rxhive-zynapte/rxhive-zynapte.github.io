## **Usage**

- Dothiepin is prescribed for the treatment of major depressive disorder and the associated anxiety. It is also sometimes prescribed for pain relief or migraine prevention, although this is not its primary indication and other treatments are generally preferred.

- **Pharmacological classification:** Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA).

- **Mechanism of action:** Dothiepin inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin, increasing their concentration in the synaptic cleft. It also exhibits some anticholinergic properties.



## **Alternate Names**

- Dosulepin (International Nonproprietary Name)


- **Brand names:**  DOTHEP, Prothiaden (and others, which can vary regionally).



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dothiepin primarily affects the central nervous system by enhancing serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission. Its anticholinergic effects contribute to some of its side effects.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - **Absorption:**  Well-absorbed orally.
    - **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6. Subject to genetic polymorphism, influencing individual responses. Undergoes enterohepatic circulation.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted mainly in urine as metabolites. Terminal half-life approximately 20 hours, though this can vary.

- **Mode of action:** Dothiepin binds to presynaptic reuptake transporters for serotonin and norepinephrine, inhibiting their reuptake into the presynaptic neuron. This leads to increased levels of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft, prolonging their action on postsynaptic receptors.

- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation:**  Inhibits reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine.  Also exhibits anticholinergic activity, blocking muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.


- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism (CYP2D6), followed by renal excretion of metabolites.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial: 75 mg daily, given as a single dose at night or in divided doses.
- Maintenance:  May be increased gradually up to 150 mg daily, if required.  In some cases (e.g., hospital settings), doses up to 225 mg/day have been used.
- For pain relief or preventing migraines: 25 mg a day, gradually increasing up to 75 mg/day (max 150mg/day).


#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age for depression.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Start with a lower dose (50-75 mg/day) and increase cautiously.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce dosage and use with caution due to the risk of accumulation.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Contraindicated in severe liver disease. Reduce dosage and use cautiously in mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, epilepsy, glaucoma, urinary retention, or hyperthyroidism.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Dothiepin is not typically indicated for use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU.  Its primary role is in the management of depression and associated anxiety in outpatient settings.  In emergency situations, other medications are generally preferred.


### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- Dosage adjustments are based on individual response and tolerability.  Close monitoring is necessary, especially when initiating therapy or modifying the dose.  Therapeutic drug monitoring can be helpful in certain cases.





## **Side Effects**

- Seizures
- Severe allergic reactions (e.g., skin rash, swelling)
- Urinary retention
- Jaundice
- Hallucinations, confusion

## **Drug Interactions**

- **MAOIs:** Increased risk of serotonin syndrome.

- **CYP inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin):** Decreased dothiepin levels.
- **Anticholinergics:** Additive anticholinergic effects.
- **Sympathomimetics:**  Enhanced sympathomimetic effects.
- **Antihypertensives (e.g., guanethidine):** Antagonism of antihypertensive effects.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Limited data are available.  Use only if potential benefit outweighs risk.

- **Fetal risks:** Potential for neonatal withdrawal symptoms.

- **Breastfeeding:**  Small amounts are excreted in breast milk. Potential for adverse effects in the infant, though generally considered safe.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake.
- **Side Effects:** Drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, weight gain.
- **Contraindications:**  Recent MI, heart block, mania, severe liver disease, MAOI use.
- **Drug Interactions:** MAOIs, alcohol, CYP2D6 inhibitors/inducers.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution.  Monitor infant.
- **Dosage:**  Adults: 75-150 mg/day. Elderly: 50-75 mg/day initially.
