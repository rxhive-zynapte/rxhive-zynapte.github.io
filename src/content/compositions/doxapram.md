## **Usage**

Doxapram is a central respiratory stimulant primarily prescribed for the treatment of:

* **Postanesthesia Respiratory Depression:**  Reversal of respiratory depression induced by general anesthesia following surgical procedures.
* **Drug-Induced CNS Depression:** Reversal of respiratory depression caused by drug overdose with central nervous system depressants.
* **Acute Hypercapnia in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD):** Short-term management of acute exacerbations of COPD associated with acute hypercapnia.
* **Apnea of Prematurity (off-label):** Although not FDA-approved, it's sometimes used to treat apnea of prematurity when other treatments fail.


**Pharmacological Classification:** Central Respiratory Stimulant

**Mechanism of Action:** Doxapram stimulates respiration primarily by acting on peripheral carotid chemoreceptors, which are sensitive to changes in blood oxygen levels. This stimulation leads to an increase in tidal volume and respiratory rate.  It also has a minor stimulatory effect on the central respiratory centers in the medulla.

## **Alternate Names**

* **Generic Name:** Doxapram Hydrochloride
* **Brand Name:** Dopram

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Doxapram stimulates breathing by acting on the peripheral carotid chemoreceptors and, to a lesser extent, the medullary respiratory center.  This results in increased tidal volume and respiratory rate.  It can also cause a release of catecholamines, leading to a transient increase in blood pressure and heart rate.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Rapidly absorbed following intravenous administration.
* **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP450 enzymes.
* **Elimination:** Excreted mainly through the kidneys, with a small amount excreted in bile.

**Mode of Action:**  Doxapram primarily acts on the carotid chemoreceptors by enhancing their sensitivity to hypoxia. This leads to increased afferent nerve impulses to the respiratory center in the brainstem, resulting in increased respiratory drive.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Doxapram's primary mode of action is not through direct receptor binding but through modulation of carotid chemoreceptor activity.  It does not directly inhibit or induce CYP450 enzymes, although it is metabolized by them.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily renal excretion following hepatic metabolism.


## **Dosage**

Doxapram is administered intravenously (IV). Dosage and administration methods vary depending on the clinical indication.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Postanesthesia Respiratory Depression:**  0.5-1.5 mg/kg IV, repeated every 5 minutes as needed, not to exceed 2 mg/kg total dose. Alternatively, an initial IV infusion of 2-5 mg/minute can be titrated to response, with the maintenance dose usually ranging from 1â€“3 mg/minute, maximum 4 mg/kg total dose.
* **Drug-induced Respiratory Depression:** Initial bolus dose of 1-2 mg/kg, followed by an infusion of 1-3 mg/minute, titrated to effect. Maximum daily dose: 3 grams.
* **Acute Hypercapnia in COPD:** 1-2 mg/minute IV infusion, titrated as needed. Maximum 3 mg/minute. Duration should not exceed 2 hours.  Monitor arterial blood gases.

#### **Children:**

* Safety and efficacy have not been established in children under 12 years of age.
* For children over 12 years, follow adult dosing guidelines but with careful monitoring.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to increased risk of adverse effects. Lower doses and slower administration rates may be necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Use with caution. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution as doxapram is metabolized by the liver. Dose reduction may be required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is crucial, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, or seizure disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Intubation:** May be used as an adjunct to facilitate intubation in patients with respiratory depression.
* **Surgical Procedures:** Used postoperatively to reverse respiratory depression induced by anesthesia.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:**  Doxapram should not be used concurrently with mechanical ventilation as this can increase the risk of respiratory alkalosis and other adverse events.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** May be used in the ICU setting for short-term management of acute respiratory depression.
* **Emergency Situations:** May be used in certain emergency situations, such as drug overdose.


### **Dosage Adjustments:**

* **Renal/Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dose reduction may be necessary.
* **Metabolic Disorders/Genetic Polymorphisms:** Careful monitoring is warranted.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

* Hypertension
* Tachycardia
* Headache
* Dizziness

* Vomiting
* Cough
* Dyspnea


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Cerebral edema
* Respiratory distress syndrome


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Limited data available on long-term effects.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

* Severe hypertension

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Sympathomimetics:** May potentiate cardiovascular effects, leading to severe hypertension and arrhythmias.
* **MAO Inhibitors:** Concomitant use can lead to hypertensive crisis.
* **Volatile Anesthetics:** May increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
* **Aminophylline/Theophylline:**  May increase CNS stimulation and other adverse effects.
* **Neuromuscular Blocking Agents:** Doxapram may temporarily mask the residual effects of these drugs.
* **CYP450 Inhibitors/Inducers:** Potential for altered doxapram metabolism.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Doxapram is classified as Pregnancy Category B. Animal studies have not shown harm to the fetus, but there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.  Use only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:** It is unknown if doxapram is excreted in human milk. Use caution when administering to nursing mothers.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
