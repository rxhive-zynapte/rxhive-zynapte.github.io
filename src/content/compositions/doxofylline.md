      How does Doxofylline work?**

      **A:** Doxofylline is a bronchodilator that inhibits phosphodiesterase 4,
      leading to increased intracellular cAMP levels and smooth muscle

## **Usage**

- Doxofylline is prescribed for the treatment of bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other pulmonary diseases with a spastic bronchial component.  It helps manage symptoms like wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Bronchodilator, Xanthine derivative.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Doxofylline is a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, which increases intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP). This leads to bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, improving airflow in the lungs.  It also exhibits some anti-inflammatory properties and inhibits platelet-activating factor (PAF).

## **Alternate Names**

- Doxophylline
- **Brand Names:** Doxofree, Doxolator, Dilatair, Doxofix, Ansimar and others.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Doxofylline relaxes the bronchial smooth muscles by inhibiting phosphodiesterase 4, leading to increased intracellular cAMP levels. This results in bronchodilation, reducing airway resistance and improving lung function.  It also possesses some anti-inflammatory actions and may inhibit PAF.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Well-absorbed orally. Peak plasma concentrations reached within 1 hour. Absolute bioavailability is around 63%.
    - **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver (90%), primarily to the inactive metabolite beta-hydroxymethyltheophylline.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily via hepatic metabolism. Less than 4% excreted unchanged in the urine. Elimination half-life is 7-10 hours, permitting twice-daily dosing. Steady state reached in about 4 days.
- **Mode of Action:** Doxofylline selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase 4, leading to bronchodilation.  It has a lower affinity for adenosine receptors compared to theophylline, potentially contributing to its better safety profile.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Primarily acts by inhibiting phosphodiesterase 4, leading to increased cAMP levels. It has lower affinity for adenosine receptors compared to theophylline.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Mainly hepatic metabolism with less than 4% renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 400 mg twice or thrice daily. Maximum dose: 1200 mg daily.
- Administer orally with food to minimize gastrointestinal discomfort.

#### **Children:**

- Children over 6 years:  6-9 mg/kg twice daily, up to 18mg/kg/day based on clinical response. Doxofylline sachet formulation is available for pediatric use.
- Children over 12 years: 200 mg twice or thrice daily.
- Children younger than 6 years: Dosage not well established, use with caution.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with 200 mg twice or thrice daily, due to age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be necessary. Monitor closely for adverse events.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction may be required. Monitor closely for adverse events.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with cardiovascular disease (hypertension, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias), hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcers, and hypoxemia.  Adjust dosage as needed.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical scenarios are not explicitly defined in the provided sources, and standard dosing guidelines generally apply. For intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations, consult specialist literature or an expert pulmonologist for guidance.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjust dosage based on individual patient response and tolerance.
