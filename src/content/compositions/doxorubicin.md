## **Usage**

- Doxorubicin is primarily used in the treatment of various types of cancers, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, leukemia, lymphoma,  and certain solid tumors such as lung, stomach, thyroid, and soft tissue sarcomas.  It can be utilized as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Antineoplastic agent, anthracycline antibiotic.
- Doxorubicin exerts its anticancer effects via multiple mechanisms, primarily by intercalating into DNA, inhibiting topoisomerase II, and generating free radicals, ultimately disrupting DNA synthesis and cell division, leading to apoptosis (programmed cell death) of cancer cells.

## **Alternate Names**

- Adriamycin
- Hydroxydaunorubicin
- Doxorubicin hydrochloride

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Doxorubicin's main effect is cytotoxic, targeting rapidly dividing cells, especially cancer cells.  It disrupts DNA replication and RNA synthesis, triggering apoptosis.  The cardiotoxic effect is attributed to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) damaging cardiac myocytes.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Administered intravenously, Doxorubicin exhibits rapid distribution to tissues, with the highest concentrations found in the liver, kidneys, lungs, and heart.  It is metabolized in the liver to doxorubicinol, an active metabolite.  Excretion is primarily biliary (through the liver into bile and feces), with a small portion excreted renally (through the kidneys).
- **Mode of action:** Doxorubicin intercalates between DNA base pairs, interfering with DNA replication and transcription. It also inhibits topoisomerase II, an enzyme crucial for DNA unwinding, further impeding DNA processes.  Additionally, it generates free radicals leading to oxidative stress and cell damage.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily hepatic excretion through bile into feces, with some renal excretion.  Metabolism involves conversion to doxorubicinol in the liver.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- As a single agent: 60-75 mg/m² intravenously every 21 days.
- In combination chemotherapy: 30-60 mg/m² every 3 weeks or 40-75 mg/m² every 21-28 days.
- Administer as an intravenous bolus or slow infusion over 3-10 minutes into a freely running IV line of 0.9% NaCl or 5% dextrose. Alternatively, administer via continuous infusion through a central venous catheter.

#### **Children:**

- Pediatric dosing follows similar guidelines to adults, utilizing body surface area (BSA) calculations to determine dosage. 
- Children are at higher risk of cardiotoxicity. Careful monitoring of cardiac function is essential.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Dose reduction or longer intervals between cycles may be necessary due to decreased organ function and bone marrow reserve. A maximum cumulative lifetime dose of 450 mg/m² is recommended for patients 70 years and older.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments may not be strictly necessary, but close monitoring of renal function is recommended.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction is essential. If serum bilirubin is 1.2-3 mg/dL, administer 50% of the standard dose.  If serum bilirubin is 3.1-5 mg/dL, administer 25% of the standard dose.  Doxorubicin is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 5 mg/dL or Child-Pugh class C).
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful evaluation of cardiac function is crucial for patients with pre-existing heart disease.  Adjust dosage as needed for other comorbidities like diabetes or pre-existing myelosuppression.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Doxorubicin's use in specific medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, and emergency situations is typically not indicated as the primary treatment modality. It can be used in ICU if its use is indicated for cancer treatment.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary based on patient-specific factors like age, organ function (renal and hepatic), and prior treatments. Close monitoring of blood counts, cardiac function, and liver function tests is vital throughout the treatment.  Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism may also influence dosing strategies.
