## **Usage**

Dronedarone is prescribed to reduce the risk of hospitalization for atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter in patients who have a normal sinus rhythm but a history of paroxysmal or persistent AF.  It is classified as an antiarrhythmic agent.  Dronedarone works by affecting the heart's electrical conduction system, prolonging the action potential duration and the effective refractory period. This helps stabilize the heart rhythm and prevent irregular heartbeats.

## **Alternate Names**

The International Nonproprietary Name (INN) is dronedarone.  A widely recognized brand name is MultaqÂ®.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Dronedarone acts on multiple ion channels in the heart, exhibiting properties of all four Vaughan Williams classification classes. It predominantly blocks potassium channels, thereby prolonging cardiac action potential duration and refractoriness.  It also inhibits sodium and calcium currents, further contributing to its antiarrhythmic effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Dronedarone is absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 3 to 6 hours when taken with food. It is highly protein-bound (approximately 99.7%). Dronedarone undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, primarily via CYP3A4. It has a half-life of 13 to 19 hours. Elimination occurs mainly through the biliary/fecal route, with a small portion excreted in the urine.


**Mode of Action:** At the cellular level, dronedarone blocks multiple ion channels, including potassium channels (IKr, IKs, IKur, IK,Ach), sodium channels, L-type calcium channels, and the inward rectifier potassium current. It also inhibits the sodium-potassium ATPase pump.  This multi-channel blocking action distinguishes it from other antiarrhythmics and contributes to its overall effect on cardiac rhythm.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily biliary/fecal excretion; minor renal excretion. Metabolism occurs predominantly via CYP3A4.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

400 mg twice daily, taken orally with the morning and evening meals.

#### **Children:**

The safety and efficacy of dronedarone in pediatric patients have not been established.  Use is not recommended.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustment is generally recommended for elderly patients. However, caution should be exercised due to potential age-related decreases in hepatic and renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is generally necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
    * Mild to moderate impairment: No dosage adjustment needed.
    * Severe impairment: Contraindicated.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring is advised for patients with certain comorbid conditions, such as heart failure, liver disease, or lung disease.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dronedarone is not typically used in acute clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It is primarily indicated for long-term management of atrial fibrillation.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on patient-specific factors such as drug interactions or concomitant medications.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, asthenia/fatigue.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Bradycardia, heart failure, hepatic dysfunction (including severe liver injury requiring transplantation), pulmonary toxicity (including pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease), QT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, stroke, death.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential long-term effects include chronic hepatic or pulmonary complications with prolonged use.  Regular monitoring of liver function and pulmonary function is essential during long-term therapy.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs include severe hepatic dysfunction, pulmonary toxicity, Torsades de Pointes, stroke, and worsening of heart failure.



## **Contraindications**

* Severe heart failure (NYHA Class IV) or symptomatic heart failure with recent decompensation.
* Permanent atrial fibrillation.
* Second- or third-degree atrioventricular block or sick sinus syndrome (unless a functioning pacemaker is present).
* Bradycardia (<50 bpm).
* Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin).
* Concomitant use of QT-prolonging drugs.
* Severe hepatic impairment.
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding.



## **Drug Interactions**

Dronedarone interacts with numerous medications, including:
* **CYP3A4 inhibitors:** Significantly increase dronedarone plasma levels.
* **CYP3A4 inducers:**  Decrease dronedarone plasma levels.
* **QT-prolonging drugs:**  Increase the risk of Torsades de Pointes.
* **Digoxin:** Dronedarone increases digoxin plasma levels. Dosage adjustment of digoxin may be necessary.
* **Statins:** Concomitant use with certain statins may increase the risk of myopathy.
* **Grapefruit juice:** Avoid grapefruit juice as it can increase dronedarone plasma levels.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Dronedarone is contraindicated during pregnancy (Pregnancy Category X) and breastfeeding. It can cause fetal harm and may be excreted in breast milk.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Multi-channel blocker in the heart, predominantly potassium channels, leading to prolonged action potential and refractoriness.
* **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue; rarely, bradycardia, heart failure, hepatic/pulmonary toxicity, Torsades de Pointes, stroke, death.
* **Contraindications:** Severe heart failure, permanent AF, AV block, bradycardia, concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or QT-prolonging drugs, severe hepatic impairment, pregnancy, breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** Numerous, including CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers, QT-prolonging drugs, digoxin, statins, grapefruit juice.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
* **Dosage:** 400 mg twice daily with meals.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  ECG (including QTc interval), liver function tests, renal function, electrolytes (potassium, magnesium), signs and symptoms of heart failure and pulmonary toxicity.


## **Popular Combinations**

Dronedarone is not typically used in combination with other antiarrhythmic drugs due to the potential for additive effects on QT prolongation and the risk of proarrhythmia.


## **Precautions**

* Pre-screening for heart failure, hepatic and renal function, and electrolyte imbalances.
* Monitor ECG, liver function tests, and renal function regularly during treatment.
* Avoid grapefruit juice.
* Caution in patients with a history of liver or lung disease.
