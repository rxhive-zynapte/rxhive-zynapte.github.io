      Can Dulaglutide be used in patients with renal impairment?**


      **A:** Yes, but with caution in patients with severe renal impairment

## **Usage**

- Dulaglutide is prescribed for adults and children 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycemic control, along with diet and exercise. It is also indicated to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke) in adults with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Incretin mimetic, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, antidiabetic agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dulaglutide works by mimicking the effects of GLP-1, a natural hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. It stimulates insulin release when blood glucose is elevated, suppresses glucagon secretion (which raises blood glucose), slows gastric emptying, and may reduce appetite.

## **Alternate Names**

-  No alternate generic names are commonly used.
- **Brand Names:** Trulicity

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dulaglutide binds to and activates GLP-1 receptors, leading to increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion, decreased glucagon secretion, delayed gastric emptying, and possibly reduced appetite.  These actions collectively contribute to improved glycemic control.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Administered subcutaneously, dulaglutide is absorbed slowly, reaching peak concentrations in about 48 hours. It has a half-life of approximately 5 days, allowing for once-weekly administration. Dulaglutide is metabolized through proteolytic degradation, similar to endogenous peptides, with no involvement of cytochrome P450 enzymes. It is eliminated primarily through renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** Dulaglutide acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist. GLP-1 receptors are found on pancreatic beta cells, alpha cells, and in the brain and gut. By binding to and activating these receptors, dulaglutide mimics the effects of endogenous GLP-1.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Dulaglutide's primary mechanism involves GLP-1 receptor agonism. There is no significant interaction with CYP450 enzymes or known neurotransmitter modulation.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion;  metabolized through proteolytic cleavage.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: 0.75 mg subcutaneously once weekly.
- Maintenance dose:  May be increased to 1.5 mg once weekly if additional glycemic control is needed. Further increases to 3 mg and then to a maximum of 4.5 mg once weekly are possible at intervals of at least 4 weeks, based on clinical response.


#### **Children (10 years and older):**

- Initial dose: 0.75 mg subcutaneously once weekly.
- Maximum dose: 1.5 mg subcutaneously once weekly after at least 4 weeks at the lower dose if further glycemic control is needed.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is required based solely on age.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is required. Use with caution in end-stage renal disease (eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m²), as there is limited experience in this population.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment is required. Use with caution due to limited data.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis or severe gastrointestinal disease, including gastroparesis. Not recommended for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or diabetic ketoacidosis. For patients with diabetic retinopathy, monitor closely.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dulaglutide is not indicated for use in situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations such as status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.  Its role is specifically in chronic glycemic management of type 2 diabetes.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on the individual patient’s glycemic response and are made at intervals of at least 4 weeks as outlined above.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, constipation, dyspepsia.

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Potential long-term effects may include chronic pancreatitis,  gallbladder disease, and renal impairment. Regular monitoring is essential.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2).


## **Drug Interactions**

- Dulaglutide's absorption may be affected by medications that slow gastric emptying.
- Concomitant use with insulin or insulin secretagogues may increase the risk of hypoglycemia.  Dosage adjustment of these medications may be necessary.
- No clinically significant interactions with CYP450 enzymes are known.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Category C (data limited; animal studies show some risk). Use only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
- It is unknown whether dulaglutide is excreted in human breast milk. Caution is advised when using in breastfeeding mothers.

- **Monitoring Parameters:** HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, renal function tests, signs of pancreatitis.


## **Popular Combinations**

- Metformin: Commonly used in combination with metformin to achieve additive glycemic control.
- SGLT2 Inhibitors:  May be combined with SGLT2 inhibitors to further improve glycemic control and potentially reduce cardiovascular risk.
- Insulin: Can be added to basal insulin therapy when additional glycemic control is needed.


## **Precautions**

- Monitor renal function, especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment.
- Monitor for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis.
