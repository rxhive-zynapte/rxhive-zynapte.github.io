## **Usage**

Durvalumab is prescribed for the treatment of various cancers, including:

* **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC):**  Specifically for unresectable, stage III NSCLC whose disease has not progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and as neoadjuvant therapy, in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy followed by adjuvant durvalumab monotherapy after surgery, in adults with resectable (tumors ≥4 cm or node positive) NSCLC and no known EGFR mutations or ALK genetic changes.
* **Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC):** For extensive-stage SCLC in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin, and for adults with limited-stage SCLC (LS-SCLC) whose disease has not progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation therapy
* **Urothelial Carcinoma:** In certain locally advanced or metastatic settings.
* **Biliary Tract Cancer:** In combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for advanced or metastatic disease that has not been previously treated.
* **Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC):** For unresectable HCC in adults previously treated with sorafenib.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Durvalumab is a monoclonal antibody classified as an immune checkpoint inhibitor.  More specifically, it is a  programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blocking antibody.

**Mechanism of Action:** Durvalumab blocks the interaction between PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 on T-cells. This blockade prevents the tumor from suppressing the immune response, allowing T-cells to recognize and attack cancer cells.

## **Alternate Names**

**International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Durvalumab

**Brand Name:** Imfinzi

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Durvalumab enhances the immune response against tumor cells by inhibiting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway.  This pathway is used by tumor cells to reduce the activation of T cells.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Administered intravenously.
* **Metabolism:**  The metabolism of durvalumab has not been fully characterized. As a human monoclonal antibody, it is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in a manner similar to endogenous IgG.
* **Elimination:** The clearance of durvalumab has not been found to be meaningfully impacted by concomitant chemotherapy treatment. No dose adjustments are needed based on weight, age, sex, race, mild to moderate renal impairment, or mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There are no data to determine dose adjustments for severe renal impairment or severe hepatic impairment.


**Mode of Action:** Durvalumab binds to PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells and in the tumor microenvironment, blocking its interaction with PD-1 on T-cells and CD80 (B7.1) on T-cells. This blockade removes the inhibitory signal on T-cells, allowing them to recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively.

**Receptor Binding:**  Durvalumab binds specifically to the PD-L1 receptor.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily catabolic pathways, similar to endogenous IgG.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **NSCLC (unresectable, stage III):** 10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks or 1500 mg IV every 4 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 12 months (or 24 months for LS-SCLC).
* **NSCLC (neoadjuvant/adjuvant):**  1500 mg IV every 3 weeks for neoadjuvant therapy; 1500 mg IV every 4 weeks for adjuvant therapy.
* **SCLC (extensive-stage):** 1500 mg IV on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles in combination with chemotherapy.  Subsequent cycles: 1500 mg IV every 4 weeks.
* **LS-SCLC:** 1500 mg IV every 4 weeks for up to 24 months following concurrent chemoradiation.


#### **Children:**  Limited data is available. Trials have investigated 15 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks. Safety and efficacy have not been fully established in pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is required.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is required for mild or moderate impairment. Limited data for severe impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is required for mild or moderate impairment. Limited data for severe impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with pre-existing autoimmune conditions,  immune deficiencies, or requiring systemic immunosuppression.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Durvalumab is not typically indicated for acute settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It is primarily used as an anti-cancer agent in the outpatient setting.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose reductions are not recommended.  Treatment may be withheld or discontinued based on toxicity.
