## **Usage**

- Dutasteride is prescribed for the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men with an enlarged prostate. It helps improve urinary flow, reduce the risk of acute urinary retention (AUR), and decrease the need for BPH-related surgery.  It is also used off-label for androgenic alopecia (male pattern hair loss).
- **Pharmacological Classification:** 5-alpha reductase inhibitor.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Dutasteride inhibits both type 1 and type 2 isoforms of 5-alpha reductase, the enzyme responsible for converting testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT).  DHT is the primary androgen responsible for prostatic growth in BPH. By reducing DHT levels, dutasteride shrinks the prostate, relieves BPH symptoms, and reduces associated complications.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International and Regional Variations:**  Generic name dutasteride is commonly used internationally.
- **Brand Names:** Avodart, Jalyn (combination with tamsulosin).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Dutasteride inhibits both type 1 and type 2 5-alpha reductase isoenzymes. This results in a significant decrease in serum dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels, leading to a reduction in prostate size and improvement in BPH symptoms.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Dutasteride reaches peak serum concentrations (Tmax) within 2-3 hours after oral administration. Food may delay Tmax but has a negligible effect on bioavailability.  Steady-state serum concentrations are achieved within 6 months. Absolute bioavailability is approximately 60%.
    - **Metabolism:**  Dutasteride undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism primarily by CYP3A4/5 enzymes, forming various hydroxylated metabolites.
    - **Elimination:** Dutasteride has a long elimination half-life of up to 5 weeks. Less than 1% is excreted unchanged in urine, with approximately 5% excreted unchanged in feces and 40% as metabolites. Total body clearance is about 0.6 L/hour.
- **Mode of Action:** Dutasteride competes with testosterone for binding to the active site of both type 1 and type 2 5-alpha reductase isoenzymes, forming a stable enzyme complex that prevents the conversion of testosterone to DHT.
- **Receptor binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter modulation**:  Dutasteride specifically inhibits 5-alpha reductase isoenzymes. It does *not* bind to androgen receptors. It does *not* have direct effects on neurotransmitter systems.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism followed by fecal excretion. Minimal renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 0.5 mg (one capsule) orally once daily, with or without food.
- Treatment may require up to 6 months for a noticeable improvement in symptoms, and it is generally continued for life for BPH management.

#### **Children:**

- Dutasteride is *not* recommended for use in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution should be used in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  Dutasteride is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with a history of cardiac failure.  Combination therapy with tamsulosin may increase the risk of cardiac events.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dutasteride is not indicated for the following:

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations**


### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- Dosage adjustments are generally not necessary for renal impairment or in elderly patients.
- Caution is advised in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, and the drug is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Impotence (Erectile Dysfunction)
- Decreased libido
- Ejaculation disorders
- Gynecomastia (breast enlargement or tenderness)
- Dizziness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, hives, swelling)
- Male breast cancer
- Cardiac failure
- Depressed mood.

### **Long-Term Effects:**
- Long-term side effects are generally similar to the common side effects. Male breast cancer is a rare long-term side effect.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
- Serious skin reactions
- Angioedema (swelling of face, lips, tongue, throat)



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to dutasteride, other 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, or any component of the formulation.
- Women, children, and adolescents.
- Patients with severe hepatic impairment.
- Women who are or may become pregnant.


## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP450 Interactions:** Dutasteride is metabolized by CYP3A4/5. Inhibitors of these enzymes (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole) may increase dutasteride levels. Inducers of these enzymes (e.g., rifampin) may decrease dutasteride levels.
- **Other Drug Interactions:**  Dutasteride may interact with tamsulosin (increased risk of cardiac failure in some studies). No clinically significant interactions with warfarin or digoxin have been reported.
- **OTC Drugs and Supplements:**  No specific clinically significant interactions have been consistently reported.
- **Food and Lifestyle Factors:**  Food may delay the time to peak concentration but doesn't significantly affect overall bioavailability.  No specific interactions with alcohol or smoking are documented.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** X (Contraindicated). Dutasteride can cause fetal harm.  Women of childbearing potential should not handle crushed or broken capsules.
- **Fetal Risks:** Dutasteride inhibits the formation of male external genitalia in a developing male fetus.
- **Breastfeeding:**  It is unknown if dutasteride is excreted in breast milk.  Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, breastfeeding is contraindicated while taking dutasteride.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits type 1 and type 2 5-alpha reductase, reducing DHT levels and prostate size.
- **Side Effects:** Impotence, decreased libido, ejaculation disorders, gynecomastia, dizziness.  Rarely: allergic reactions, male breast cancer, cardiac failure.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, women, children, severe hepatic impairment, pregnancy.
- **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, tamsulosin.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
- **Dosage:** 0.5 mg orally once daily.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, digital rectal examination, monitor for sexual dysfunction and breast changes.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Dutasteride and Tamsulosin (Jalyn): This combination provides synergistic improvement in BPH symptoms by targeting both static and dynamic components of bladder outlet obstruction.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Evaluate liver function and PSA levels before starting treatment.
- **Specific Populations:**
    - **Pregnant Women:**  Absolutely contraindicated.
    - **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Contraindicated.
    - **Children & Elderly:** Not recommended for children. No dosage adjustment needed for the elderly.
