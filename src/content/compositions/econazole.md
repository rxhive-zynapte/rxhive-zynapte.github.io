## **Usage**

Econazole is prescribed for fungal skin infections such as athlete's foot (tinea pedis), jock itch (tinea cruris), ringworm (tinea corporis), cutaneous candidiasis, and tinea versicolor.  It belongs to the **imidazole** class of antifungal medications. Econazole works by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol, a crucial component of fungal cell membranes. This disruption leads to increased cell permeability and leakage of cellular contents, ultimately resulting in fungal cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

Econazole is also known as econazole nitrate. Brand names include Ecoza, Spectazole, Econasil, and Zolpak.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Econazole exerts its antifungal effect by inhibiting the enzyme 14-α demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme essential for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol in fungal cells. This inhibition disrupts the fungal cell membrane structure, leading to increased permeability and leakage of cellular contents.  

**Pharmacokinetics:** When applied topically, econazole exhibits minimal systemic absorption, with less than 1% of the applied dose recovered in urine and feces. This minimal systemic absorption makes it suitable for topical treatment of localized fungal infections. The drug is primarily metabolized in the liver.

**Mode of Action:** Econazole binds to 14-α demethylase, inhibiting its activity. This blockage prevents the synthesis of ergosterol, a key sterol in fungal cell membranes. The resultant ergosterol depletion alters membrane fluidity and function, leading to cell death.

**Elimination Pathways:** Econazole is primarily metabolized by the liver. Excretion occurs primarily through the feces, with minimal amounts eliminated in the urine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Cream:** Apply a thin layer to the affected area(s) once daily for tinea pedis, tinea cruris, tinea corporis, and tinea versicolor. Apply twice daily (morning and evening) for cutaneous candidiasis.
* **Foam:** Apply once daily to the affected area(s) for interdigital tinea pedis.

Treatment duration is typically 2 weeks for cutaneous candidiasis, tinea cruris, tinea corporis, and tinea versicolor, and 4 weeks for tinea pedis. In some cases, treatment may be extended up to 6 weeks.

#### **Children:**

For children older than 3 months, topical econazole can be used under the guidance of a doctor.  Dosage and frequency are determined by the doctor based on the child's age, weight, and the specific infection being treated. Safety and efficacy in children younger than 3 months have not been established. For the foam formulation, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 12 years.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustments are necessary due to minimal systemic absorption.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No dosage adjustments are necessary due to minimal systemic absorption.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consult a doctor for appropriate dosing guidance in patients with comorbid conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Econazole is primarily indicated for topical use and is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are not routinely needed based on renal or hepatic function, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms because of the minimal systemic absorption of topical econazole.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Burning
* Itching
* Stinging
* Redness at the application site
* Rash


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to econazole or any of the ingredients in the formulation.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Warfarin:**  While a direct interaction is not definitively established, caution is advised when using econazole with warfarin due to potential effects on warfarin metabolism.
* **Corticosteroids:** Concurrent use of topical corticosteroids may reduce the antifungal efficacy of econazole.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** While considered low risk, topical econazole should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Limited information suggests that econazole may be present in breast milk. Avoid applying to the nipple area.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits ergosterol synthesis, disrupting fungal cell membranes.
* **Side Effects:** Burning, itching, stinging, redness, rash.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to econazole.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Warfarin, corticosteroids.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if clearly needed.
* **Dosage:** See detailed dosage guidelines above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for treatment response and local skin reactions.

## **Popular Combinations**

Econazole is not typically used in combination with other drugs for topical treatment of fungal infections.

## **Precautions**

* For external use only.  Avoid contact with eyes.
* Discontinue use if irritation or sensitization occurs.
