      Can topical eflornithine be used during pregnancy or while
      breastfeeding?**

      **A:** Topical eflornithine is generally considered safe during pregnancy
      and breastfeeding due to its low systemic absorption. However, intravenous
      eflornithine carries risks during pregnancy and is not recommended while
      breastfeeding.

  - q: >-
      What is the mechanism of action of eflornithine?**

      **A:** Eflornithine irreversibly inhibits the enzyme ornithine
      decarboxylase (ODC), which is involved in polyamine synthesis. This leads
      to the inhibition of cell growth and division, affecting the rate of hair
      growth or the proliferation of trypanosomes.

      What are some important considerations for patient counseling regarding

      **A:** Patients should be informed that topical eflornithine is not a
      depilatory and does not permanently remove hair.  It is important to
      manage expectations and inform patients that continued use is needed to
      maintain the reduction in hair growth. Patients using the intravenous
      formulation should be educated on the potential for serious adverse
      effects, including bone marrow suppression, hearing loss, and seizures,
      and the importance of reporting any new or worsening symptoms promptly.

## **Usage**

- Eflornithine is prescribed for two main purposes:
    1. **Treatment of second-stage West African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness)** caused by *Trypanosoma brucei gambiense*. This parasitic infection affects the central nervous system.  Intravenous administration is used for this purpose.
    2. **Reduction of unwanted facial hair growth (hirsutism)** in women. Topical cream formulation is used for this indication.
- **Pharmacological classification:**  Enzyme inhibitor (ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor), antiprotozoal agent (for sleeping sickness).
- **Mechanism of action:** Eflornithine irreversibly inhibits ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), an enzyme crucial for polyamine biosynthesis. Polyamines are essential for cell division and growth. By inhibiting ODC, eflornithine slows the rate of hair growth and interferes with the proliferation of trypanosomes.

## **Alternate Names**

- **Generic name:** Eflornithine hydrochloride
- **Brand names:** Vaniqa (topical cream), Ornidyl (injectable)
- **Other names:** DFMO (difluoromethylornithine)



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Eflornithine inhibits ornithine decarboxylase, which leads to a depletion of polyamines, inhibiting cell growth and division.  This leads to slowed hair follicle growth in topical applications and suppression of  trypanosome replication in intravenous application.
- **Pharmacokinetics (Topical):**  Minimally absorbed systemically following topical application.
- **Pharmacokinetics (Intravenous):**  Peak plasma concentrations reached in approximately 4 hours. Elimination half-life is 3-4 hours. Primarily excreted unchanged in urine.
- **Mode of action:** Irreversible inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase.
- **Receptor binding/enzyme inhibition/neurotransmitter modulation:** Suicide inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (Topical):**

- Apply a thin layer of eflornithine cream 13.9% to the affected areas of the face and adjacent skin under the chin twice daily, at least 8 hours apart.
- Maximum dose: Up to 30 grams per month.

#### **Children (Topical):**

- Safety and efficacy not established in children under 18 years of age for topical use.

#### **Adults (Intravenous - for West African trypanosomiasis):**

- 100 mg/kg every 6 hours intravenously for 14 days.

#### **Children (Intravenous - for West African trypanosomiasis):**
- Under 12 years: 150 mg/kg every 6 hours intravenously for 14 days.
- 12 years and over: 100 mg/kg every 6 hours intravenously for 14 days.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment necessary for topical or intravenous use.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution advised in patients with severe renal impairment for both formulations, as eflornithine is primarily renally excreted.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustment recommendations. Exercise caution.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific dose adjustments indicated. However, consider individual patient characteristics.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  The listed clinical use cases apply to situations encountered during intravenous eflornithine administration for West African sleeping sickness.  These scenarios are not applicable to topical eflornithine cream usage. Topical eflornithine cream is solely used for the reduction of unwanted facial hair.


- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, Emergency Situations**: Dosage adjustment may be needed depending on the specific situation and the patient's condition during intravenous eflornithine administration for West African sleeping sickness.


### **Dosage Adjustments**
Dosage adjustments are necessary for intravenous eflornithine for patients with impaired renal function. For topical eflornithine cream, no formal dose adjustments are provided, but practitioners should exercise clinical judgment in patients with renal or hepatic impairments.
