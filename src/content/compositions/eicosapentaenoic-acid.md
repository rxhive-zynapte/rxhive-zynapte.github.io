# Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA)

## Usage

Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is an omega-3 fatty acid primarily used to treat hypertriglyceridemia, a condition characterized by elevated triglyceride levels in the blood.  It is also used for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with elevated triglycerides and established cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Additionally, EPA may be used in other clinical situations, although not always as a standard treatment, such as in severe respiratory issues like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

It is classified pharmacologically as a lipid-lowering agent and an anti-inflammatory agent.

EPA's mechanism of action involves multiple pathways.  It reduces triglyceride synthesis, inhibits platelet aggregation, decreases inflammation, and improves endothelial function.  Specifically, EPA can decrease the production of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), which are rich in triglycerides.

## Alternate Names

- EPA
- Omega-3 fatty acid
- Fish oil
- Omega-3 oil(s)

Brand names include Vascepa (icosapent ethyl, a highly purified form of EPA).


## How It Works

**Pharmacodynamics:** EPA exerts its effects by:
* Reducing triglyceride levels: Primarily by decreasing VLDL synthesis and secretion in the liver.
* Anti-inflammatory effects:  It competes with arachidonic acid, reducing the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids like prostaglandins and leukotrienes.
* Anti-thrombotic effects: Decreases platelet aggregation.
* Improving endothelial function: Promotes vasodilation and reduces the expression of adhesion molecules.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* Absorption: EPA is absorbed in the small intestine and incorporated into chylomicrons.
* Metabolism: Undergoes hepatic metabolism, primarily through beta-oxidation.  Can also be elongated and desaturated to form other omega-3 fatty acids like docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).
* Elimination: Excreted primarily through bile and feces, with a small amount in urine.

**Mode of action (cellular/molecular):**  EPA acts on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), specifically PPAR-alpha, which modulate lipid metabolism. It also affects gene expression related to inflammation and endothelial function.

**Receptor binding/enzyme inhibition/neurotransmitter modulation:**  Binds to PPAR-alpha.  Inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes involved in eicosanoid synthesis.

**Elimination pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion.



## Dosage

### Standard Dosage

#### Adults:

For hypertriglyceridemia: 1-4 grams/day of EPA (or EPA+DHA), taken in divided doses with meals.  The dose of icosapent ethyl (Vascepa) is typically 4 grams/day (two 0.5 gram capsules four times daily or two 1 gram capsules twice daily).
For cardiovascular risk reduction: 4 grams/day of icosapent ethyl (Vascepa).


#### Children:

Dosage is not well-established in children, and use should be under the supervision of a healthcare professional.



#### Special Cases:

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are usually necessary, but monitor for potential side effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dosage adjustment may be necessary, especially in severe renal disease.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment is usually necessary, but monitor liver function tests.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider potential drug interactions and adjust dosages accordingly. For example, patients on anticoagulants should be monitored for increased bleeding risk.

### Clinical Use Cases

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical settings are not standardized beyond the indications mentioned above (hypertriglyceridemia and cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with elevated triglycerides).  The use of EPA in other conditions, including those below, is not consistently supported by evidence and needs further research. 
* **Intubation**
* **Surgical Procedures**
* **Mechanical Ventilation**
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
* **Emergency Situations**


### Dosage Adjustments

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on patient-specific factors such as renal/hepatic dysfunction, concomitant medications (especially anticoagulants), and response to therapy.



## Side Effects

### Common Side Effects:

* Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, diarrhea, belching, heartburn)
* Mild bleeding or bruising
* Flu-like symptoms
* Back pain
* Skin rash


### Rare but Serious Side Effects

* Serious bleeding
* Allergic reactions (e.g., rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)

### Long-Term Effects:

Potential long-term effects are not fully understood, but some studies suggest a possible increased risk of atrial fibrillation with high doses of EPA.

### Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):

Clinically significant ADRs may include serious bleeding events.


## Contraindications

* Known hypersensitivity to fish or shellfish.
* Severe hepatic impairment (use with caution).


## Drug Interactions

* Anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents (warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel): Increased risk of bleeding. Monitor INR and bleeding time.
* Some medications may affect EPA absorption or metabolism.


## Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

EPA is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but always consult a doctor to determine the appropriate dosage and potential risks versus benefits.


## Drug Profile Summary

* **Mechanism of Action:** Reduces triglyceride synthesis, anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, improves endothelial function.
* **Side Effects:** Gastrointestinal upset, mild bleeding, flu-like symptoms. Serious: severe bleeding, allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Fish/shellfish allergy.
* **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally considered safe. Consult a physician.
* **Dosage:** 1-4 g/day for hypertriglyceridemia. 4 g/day of icosapent ethyl for cardiovascular risk reduction.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Triglyceride levels, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, INR (if on anticoagulants).



## Popular Combinations

EPA is sometimes combined with other lipid-lowering agents, particularly statins, in patients with combined hyperlipidemia.



## Precautions

* Monitor for bleeding signs.
* Assess renal and hepatic function.
* Monitor lipid profile regularly.
* Patients with fish/shellfish allergy should avoid EPA.
* Use caution in patients with liver disease and bleeding disorders.
