      How does Empagliflozin differ from other diabetes medications?**


      **A:** Empagliflozin works by increasing urinary glucose excretion,
      independent of insulin secretion or action, unlike other classes like

## **Usage**

Empagliflozin is prescribed as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).  It is also indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease, and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with heart failure (HF). Additionally, it is used to reduce the risk of sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) at risk of progression.

It is classified as a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor.

Empagliflozin works by inhibiting SGLT2 in the kidneys. This blocks the reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the bloodstream, increasing urinary glucose excretion and lowering blood glucose levels.

## **Alternate Names**

The international nonproprietary name (INN) is empagliflozin. A common brand name is Jardiance. Other brand names include Synjardy (empagliflozin/metformin) and Glyxambi (empagliflozin/linagliptin).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Empagliflozin lowers blood glucose levels by increasing urinary glucose excretion. It also may have beneficial effects on blood pressure and body weight.  In patients with heart failure, empagliflozin can help to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization. It can also slow down the progression of kidney failure in patients with chronic kidney disease.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Empagliflozin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration.
* **Metabolism:** It is primarily metabolized via glucuronidation.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through urine (41.2%) and feces (41.1%), with a small portion through metabolism (17.8%). The elimination half-life is approximately 12.4 hours.


**Mode of Action:** Empagliflozin selectively inhibits SGLT2 in the kidneys, preventing glucose reabsorption and promoting its excretion in urine. It does not directly affect insulin secretion or action.



**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal and fecal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **T2DM:** 10 mg orally once daily in the morning.  May increase to 25 mg once daily if needed and tolerated, based on renal function and glycemic control.
* **Heart Failure:** 10 mg orally once daily.
* **CKD:** 10 mg orally once daily.


#### **Children (10 years and older):**

* **T2DM:** 10 mg orally once daily in the morning. May increase to 25 mg once daily if needed and tolerated.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are needed based solely on age, but consideration should be given to renal function and risk of volume depletion.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** In patients with an eGFR < 20 ml/min/1.73 m² or on dialysis for Heart Failure or CKD, the use of empagliflozin is not recommended due to a lack of studies in this patient population. For T2DM with eGFR < 30, the use of empagliflozin is not recommended.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is necessary for mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments may be needed in patients with multiple conditions. Consider lower doses of sulfonylureas or insulin when used in combination with empagliflozin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Empagliflozin is not typically used in the following clinical settings:

* **Intubation**
* **Surgical Procedures:** Withhold for at least 3 days before major surgery or procedures with prolonged fasting. Resume once the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake.
* **Mechanical Ventilation**
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
* **Emergency Situations**


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments might be necessary based on patient-specific factors like renal/hepatic impairment, concurrent medications, and other comorbid conditions. Close monitoring is essential, especially when starting empagliflozin or changing doses.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Genital mycotic infections (e.g., vulvovaginal candidiasis)

* Severe hepatic impairment


## **Drug Interactions**

Empagliflozin may interact with:

* **Diuretics:** Increased risk of dehydration and hypotension.
* **Insulin and Sulfonylureas:** Increased risk of hypoglycemia.
* **Other Antihypertensive Medications:** Enhanced hypotensive effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Not recommended during pregnancy due to potential fetal risks.
* **Breastfeeding:** Not recommended while breastfeeding due to limited data on infant safety.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** SGLT2 inhibitor, increases urinary glucose excretion.
* **Side Effects:**  Genital infections, UTIs, increased urination, DKA (rare),  hypotension.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, type 1 diabetes, DKA, severe renal or hepatic impairment, dialysis.
* **Drug Interactions:** Diuretics, insulin, sulfonylureas, antihypertensives.

* Linagliptin


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess renal function before and during treatment. Monitor for signs of DKA, UTIs, genital infections, volume depletion.
* **Specific Populations:** Not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women. Consider renal function and volume depletion risk in elderly patients. Not recommended for children under 10.
