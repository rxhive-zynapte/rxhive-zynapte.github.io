      What is the difference between Enalaprilat and Enalapril?**


      **A:** Enalaprilat is the active metabolite of enalapril.  Enalapril is
      administered orally (as Vasotec or its generic equivalent), and is
      converted to enalaprilat in the liver. Enalaprilat is administered
      intravenously, usually for acute hypertensive crisis.

## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Enalaprilat is primarily used to treat hypertensive emergencies, a severe form of high blood pressure requiring immediate intervention.  It is the active metabolite of enalapril and provides rapid blood pressure control when oral administration is not feasible.  It is also used for short-term management of severe hypertension, including cases associated with acute coronary syndromes (e.g., unstable angina, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction), acute pulmonary edema, or acute left ventricular dysfunction.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Enalaprilat is classified as an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and specifically as an antihypertensive agent.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Enalaprilat works by inhibiting the ACE enzyme, which is responsible for converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor (narrows blood vessels) and also stimulates the release of aldosterone, a hormone that promotes sodium and water retention.  By blocking the formation of angiotensin II, enalaprilat promotes vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), reduces blood volume, and lowers blood pressure.


## **Alternate Names**

- Enalaprilat is the active form of enalapril.  Enalapril itself is marketed under several brand names, most notably Vasotec. It is primarily known by its generic name internationally.



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Enalaprilat's primary effect is a reduction in blood pressure through vasodilation and reduced blood volume. It also has beneficial effects on cardiac remodeling (structural changes in the heart) in heart failure, reducing cardiac workload and improving cardiac output.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Enalaprilat is administered intravenously. It has a rapid onset of action (usually within 15 minutes) and a short half-life of about 3 to 6 hours. It is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys.

- **Mode of Action:** Enalaprilat competitively binds to and inhibits the active site of ACE. It thereby blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, reducing angiotensin II-mediated vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion.

- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Enalaprilat specifically inhibits ACE.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Enalaprilat is eliminated predominantly through renal excretion, with a small portion possibly metabolized in the liver.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The standard dosage for hypertensive emergencies is 1.25 mg administered intravenously over 5 minutes every 6 hours. Doses up to 5 mg every 6 hours have been used in controlled clinical trials, but higher doses beyond this range haven't been thoroughly studied for safety and efficacy. The duration of treatment depends on the patient's clinical response.


#### **Children:**

-  The safety and effectiveness of enalaprilat in children have not been established, and it's generally not recommended for pediatric use.  In certain very limited situations, a pediatric cardiologist may consider off-label usage under close monitoring, and the dose is carefully titrated based on weight and clinical response. The starting dose is typically much lower than the adult dose.  

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate therapy at a low dose (e.g., 0.625 mg) due to potential age-related decline in renal function and increased sensitivity to side effects. Closely monitor blood pressure and renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** For patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) â‰¤ 30 mL/min, the initial dose is 0.625 mg IV over 5 minutes. If there's an inadequate response after one hour, repeat the 0.625mg dose; administer subsequent 1.25 mg doses at six-hour intervals if there is a positive response.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment is typically needed in patients with hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** In heart failure patients with hyponatremia (low sodium) or renal impairment, start with a lower dose (0.625 mg) and titrate cautiously based on clinical response and renal function.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation:** Enalaprilat can be administered during intubation for blood pressure control, especially in hypertensive emergencies.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Its use is limited in surgical settings, as it is primarily meant for managing hypertensive crises.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:**  Enalaprilat is suitable for blood pressure management in ventilated patients, particularly those experiencing hypertension.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  It is often used in ICU for short-term control of severe hypertension.
- **Emergency Situations:** The primary clinical use of enalaprilat is for hypertensive emergencies in the ER setting.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Renal dysfunction necessitates significant dose reduction. Monitor closely.
- Dose titration is vital in heart failure with renal/hepatic issues.
- Consider genetic polymorphisms impacting drug metabolism and monitor effects.
