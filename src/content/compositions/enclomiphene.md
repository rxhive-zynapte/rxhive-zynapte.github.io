      How does Enclomiphene work?


      **A:** Enclomiphene acts as a SERM, blocking estrogen receptors in the
      hypothalamus and pituitary, leading to increased GnRH, LH, and FSH.  This
      stimulates testosterone production (in men) and ovulation (in women).

## Usage

Enclomiphene citrate is prescribed for the treatment of male hypogonadism (specifically, secondary hypogonadism) characterized by low testosterone levels and associated symptoms like reduced libido, erectile dysfunction, fatigue, and decreased muscle mass. In women, it's used to treat infertility related to ovulatory dysfunction, particularly in those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).  It is classified as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM).

Enclomiphene's mechanism of action involves competitive antagonism of estrogen receptors at the hypothalamic and pituitary levels. This reduces negative feedback inhibition, leading to increased secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Consequently, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels rise, stimulating testosterone production in the testes (in men) and follicular development and ovulation in the ovaries (in women).

## Alternate Names

Enclomiphene is the *trans* isomer of zuclomiphene, with zuclomiphene consisting of enclomiphene and clomiphene. It is also sometimes referred to as enclomifene citrate. Brand names include Androxal (though not yet FDA-approved as of February 16, 2025).


## How It Works

**Pharmacodynamics:** Enclomiphene acts as an estrogen receptor antagonist, primarily in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. By blocking estrogen's negative feedback, it stimulates the release of GnRH, LH, and FSH, ultimately increasing testosterone production in men and promoting ovulation in women.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  While detailed pharmacokinetic parameters aren't fully established, existing data suggests oral administration leads to absorption with Cmax levels observed between 2 and 12 ng/ml. Steady-state levels appear to plateau with daily doses at around 25mg. Metabolism and elimination pathways are not fully elucidated as of today, February 16, 2025, though it is expected that it is mostly metabolized by the liver and excreted in the urine.

**Mode of Action:** Enclomiphene competitively binds to estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus and pituitary, effectively blocking estrogen's inhibitory effect on GnRH release. The increased GnRH then stimulates the release of LH and FSH from the pituitary.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Enclomiphene primarily exhibits competitive antagonism at estrogen receptors. Currently, no significant interactions with other receptors, enzymes, or neurotransmitters have been documented.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Precise elimination routes haven't been definitively characterized as of February 16, 2025, however, it is thought to be primarily eliminated via hepatic (liver) metabolism followed by renal (kidney) excretion.


## Dosage


### Standard Dosage

#### Adults:

For men with secondary hypogonadism, the typical starting dose is 12.5 mg to 25 mg taken orally once daily.  Some protocols suggest starting at 6.25 mg and titrating up as needed. Doses above 25 mg don't appear to offer additional benefit in terms of LH stimulation.  For women with infertility due to anovulation, the starting dose is often 50 mg daily for 5 days, beginning on the fifth day of the menstrual cycle. Subsequent cycles may utilize higher doses (up to 100 mg daily) if ovulation doesn't occur.

#### Children:

Enclomiphene is not typically used in children, so there's no established pediatric dosing.

#### Special Cases:

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient response and tolerance.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised, and dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustments may be needed, as enclomiphene is likely metabolized by the liver.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Care should be taken in patients with pre-existing conditions like liver disease, a history of blood clots, uncontrolled adrenal or thyroid dysfunction, or hormone-sensitive cancers.

### Clinical Use Cases

Enclomiphene is not indicated for use in acute clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.  Its primary role is in chronic hormonal management.

### Dosage Adjustments

Dosage adjustments should be made based on individual patient response, tolerance, and blood testosterone levels. Regular monitoring of hormone levels is essential for optimized therapy. Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism may also require dosage adjustments.
