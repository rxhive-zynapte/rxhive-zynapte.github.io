## **Usage**

Eptacog alfa (activated) is a recombinant blood coagulation factor VIIa (rFVIIa) prescribed for the management and prevention of bleeding episodes in specific patient populations:

*   **Hemophilia A or B with inhibitors:**  Specifically indicated for patients with inhibitors to coagulation factors VIII or IX, respectively.  This includes treatment and prevention of bleeding during and after surgery.
*   **Congenital FVII deficiency:** Used to treat bleeding episodes and prevent bleeding during or after surgical or invasive procedures in patients with this inherent deficiency.
*   **Acquired hemophilia:**  Indicated for the treatment of bleeding episodes and prophylaxis of bleeding associated with surgery or invasive procedures in adults with acquired hemophilia.
*   **Glanzmann's thrombasthenia:** For controlling bleeding and providing surgical prophylaxis in patients who are refractory to platelet transfusions due to antibodies against GPIIb-IIIa and/or HLA, or when platelet transfusions are unavailable.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Hemostatic agent, blood coagulation factor.

**Mechanism of Action:** Eptacog alfa mimics the action of naturally occurring activated Factor VII.  It binds to tissue factor exposed at the site of injury, activating Factor X and ultimately converting prothrombin to thrombin.  Thrombin then catalyzes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, forming a stable clot. At pharmacological doses, eptacog alfa can also activate Factor X directly on the surface of activated platelets, independent of tissue factor, promoting more robust clot formation at the injury site.


## **Alternate Names**

*   Activated recombinant human coagulation Factor VII (rFVIIa)
*   Recombinant Factor VIIa

**Brand Names:**

*   NovoSeven®
*   NiaStase®
*   AryoSeven™


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Eptacog alfa enhances coagulation by promoting thrombin generation at the site of vascular injury. This localized effect minimizes the risk of systemic coagulation activation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Administered intravenously, thus achieving immediate systemic availability.
*   **Metabolism/Elimination:**  The metabolism and elimination pathways of rFVIIa are not fully characterized.  The half-life is relatively short (2-6 hours) with clearance rates higher in children than in adults.  Clearance mechanisms may involve binding to tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and hepatic uptake.

**Mode of Action:** Eptacog alfa initiates coagulation through two primary mechanisms:

1.  **Tissue Factor-Dependent:**  Binds to tissue factor at the injury site, forming a complex that activates Factor IX and X.  This triggers the coagulation cascade, ultimately leading to fibrin formation.

2.  **Tissue Factor-Independent:** At pharmacological doses, eptacog alfa can directly activate Factor X on the surface of activated platelets, even in the absence of tissue factor, amplifying thrombin generation and clot formation localized at the injury site.

**Receptor Binding:**  Binds specifically to tissue factor, a transmembrane receptor exposed at the site of vascular injury.

**Enzyme Activation:**  Activates Factor IX and X, key serine proteases in the coagulation cascade.

**Elimination Pathways:**  While not completely elucidated, clearance likely involves binding to TFPI, hepatic metabolism, and renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

Eptacog alfa is administered as an intravenous bolus injection. Dosage and frequency are determined by the patient's condition, bleeding severity, and response to therapy. Coagulation parameters (PT, aPTT) are not reliable indicators of eptacog alfa efficacy.



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults and Children:**

The recommended initial dose for most indications is 90 µg/kg, administered as an intravenous bolus injection over 2-5 minutes.  Subsequent doses and frequency are adjusted based on clinical response and the specific clinical scenario.

#### **Children (under 18 years old):**

Although children have faster clearance of eptacog alfa than adults, dosage is usually weight-based (90 mcg/kg initially) and adjusted according to clinical effect. No general differentiation based on age is recommended.  Higher doses or more frequent administrations might be required in younger children.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:**  Limited clinical experience with a single dose of 270 mcg/kg.  Close monitoring is essential due to the potential for age-related decrease in organ function and comorbidities, which may increase the risk of thrombotic complications.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustments are typically recommended, but close monitoring is advised.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Exercise caution as liver disease can increase the risk of thrombotic complications.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Closely monitor patients with a history of coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, or those at risk of thromboembolic events or disseminated intravascular coagulation.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage adjustments should always be based on individual clinical assessment, weighing the benefits of hemostasis against the potential risk of thrombotic complications.  See examples below:

*   **Mild to Moderate Bleeding:** 90 mcg/kg every 3 hours for 2-3 doses, possibly followed by one additional dose. Alternative regimen: Single dose of 270 mcg/kg.
*   **Serious Bleeding:**  Initial 90 mcg/kg dose, potentially administered en route to the hospital; adjust subsequent doses based on the response and clinical situation.
*   **Surgery:**  90 mcg/kg immediately before the procedure; repeated every 2 hours during the procedure. Post-operative dosing at 2-hour intervals for 24-48 hours followed by an extended interval (up to 6 hours) if treatment is continued.
*   **Major Surgery:** Postoperative dosing at 2-4 hour intervals for 6-7 days, potentially followed by a dose interval of 6-8 hours for up to 2-3 weeks.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Based on patient response, bleeding severity, and clinical scenario.  Higher doses or shortened intervals may be needed to control severe bleeding or during surgery. Longer intervals (4-12 hours) can be considered once hemostasis is achieved.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Fever
*   Headache
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Rash
*   Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Arterial and venous thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism)
*   Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
*   Allergic/hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

*   Development of antibodies against rFVIIa (rare)

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

*   Thromboembolic events requiring urgent anticoagulation.
*   Anaphylaxis necessitating immediate treatment with epinephrine and supportive care.



## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to eptacog alfa or any of its components (including mouse, hamster, or bovine proteins).
*   High risk of thromboembolic complications (e.g., recent myocardial infarction, disseminated intravascular coagulation, severe sepsis).



## **Drug Interactions**

*   **Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs):** Avoid concomitant use due to the increased risk of thrombotic events.
*   **Antifibrinolytics:**  Use with caution, as they can potentiate the procoagulant effects of eptacog alfa.  While sometimes used concomitantly, careful monitoring is necessary.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

*   **Pregnancy:**  As a precautionary measure, avoid use during pregnancy unless the potential benefit clearly outweighs the risk. Limited available data do not suggest harmful fetal effects.
*   **Breastfeeding:**  It is unknown whether eptacog alfa is excreted in human milk.  A decision should be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or the drug, considering the importance of the drug to the mother.
