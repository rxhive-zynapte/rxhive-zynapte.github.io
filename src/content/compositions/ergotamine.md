## **Usage**

- Ergotamine is prescribed for the treatment of acute migraine and cluster headaches. It is effective in aborting or preventing vascular headaches, including migraine variants and "histaminic cephalalgia."  It is not intended for the prophylaxis of migraine or for common tension headaches. It is most effective when taken at the first sign of a migraine attack.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Ergotamine is classified as an ergot alkaloid and an antimigraine agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Ergotamine acts as a vasoconstrictor, primarily affecting the cranial blood vessels. It exerts partial agonist activity at serotonin (5-HT) receptors, leading to constriction of these vessels and reducing the throbbing pain associated with vascular headaches. It also has effects on dopamine and alpha-adrenergic receptors.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:**  Ergotamine tartrate (salt form).
- **Brand Names:** Ergomar, Cafergot (in combination with caffeine), Migergot (in combination with caffeine).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ergotamine's primary effect is vasoconstriction of cranial blood vessels. Its action on serotonin (5-HT) receptors, specifically 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors, plays a crucial role in this vasoconstriction.  It also interacts with dopamine and alpha-adrenergic receptors, though to a lesser extent.  These combined effects help alleviate the symptoms of migraine and cluster headaches.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Ergotamine is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with bioavailability generally less than 5%.  Sublingual administration offers slightly improved absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Ergotamine undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4 enzymes.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted primarily in the feces (approximately 90%, mostly as metabolites) and to a lesser extent in urine (around 4%). It has a biphasic elimination half-life, with an initial phase of about 2 hours and a terminal phase of roughly 21 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Ergotamine binds to 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors on cranial blood vessels, causing vasoconstriction.  It also interacts with dopamine D2 receptors and alpha-adrenergic receptors. These actions reduce vasodilation and neurogenic inflammation, contributing to its antimigraine effects.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4, followed by fecal excretion; minor renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Sublingual:**  2 mg at the onset of migraine symptoms, then 2 mg every 30 minutes as needed. Maximum dose: 6 mg per 24 hours and 10 mg per week.
- **Oral (with caffeine):** 2 tablets (containing 1 mg ergotamine and 100 mg caffeine each) at the onset, followed by 1 tablet every 30 minutes if needed.  Maximum dose: 6 tablets per attack, 10 tablets per week.
- **Rectal (with caffeine):** 1 suppository (containing 2 mg ergotamine and 100 mg caffeine) at the onset. A second suppository can be used after 1 hour if needed. Maximum dose: 2 suppositories per attack, 5 suppositories per week.

#### **Children:**

- Ergotamine use in children is generally avoided due to the potential for serious side effects. If deemed necessary, dosage must be carefully determined by a physician, considering age and weight.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Close monitoring is advised due to potential age-related decline in hepatic and renal function. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Contraindicated.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, sepsis, or other cardiovascular conditions.  Careful cardiovascular evaluation is needed before initiating therapy.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Ergotamine's use is limited to the treatment of migraine and cluster headaches. It is **not** indicated for:

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations**

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments are necessary based on patient response and tolerability.  Renal and hepatic impairment are contraindications to its use. Close monitoring is necessary for elderly patients and those with comorbid conditions.

- Concurrent use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., protease inhibitors, macrolide antibiotics, azole antifungals)
- Concurrent use of other vasoconstrictors

## **Drug Interactions**

Ergotamine interacts with a large number of drugs, including:

- **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** These can significantly increase ergotamine levels, leading to serious toxicity.  Examples include macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin), protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole), and grapefruit juice.
- **CYP3A4 Inducers:**  These can decrease ergotamine levels, potentially reducing its effectiveness.  Examples include rifampin, phenytoin, and St. John's wort.
- **Vasoconstrictors:**  Concurrent use can lead to dangerous elevations in blood pressure. Examples include sympathomimetics (e.g., epinephrine, pseudoephedrine), triptans (e.g., sumatriptan, rizatriptan), and other ergot alkaloids.
- **Beta-blockers:** May potentiate the vasoconstricting effects of ergotamine.
- **Nicotine:** Can increase the risk of vasoconstriction.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** X (Contraindicated). Ergotamine can cause serious harm to the fetus, including fetal death and miscarriage.
- **Breastfeeding:** Ergotamine is excreted in breast milk and can cause adverse effects in infants, such as vomiting, diarrhea, weak pulse, and convulsions. Breastfeeding is contraindicated while taking ergotamine.

## **Drug Profile Summary**
