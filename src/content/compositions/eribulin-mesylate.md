  - q: >-
      Is there a difference between Eribulin and Eribulin mesylate?**


      **A:** Eribulin mesylate is the salt form of the active drug, eribulin.
      Dosing recommendations are sometimes based on the base form (eribulin) and
      sometimes on the salt form (eribulin mesylate). The ready-to-use solution
      contains 0.44 mg/ml eribulin base, which is equivalent to 0.5 mg/ml
      eribulin mesylate.

## **Usage**

Eribulin mesylate is prescribed for the treatment of:

*   **Metastatic breast cancer:** In patients who have progressed after at least one chemotherapeutic regimen for advanced disease. Prior therapy should have included an anthracycline and a taxane unless contraindicated.
*   **Unresectable or Metastatic Liposarcoma:** In patients who have received a prior anthracycline-containing regimen, unless clinically inappropriate.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antineoplastic agent, microtubule dynamics inhibitor.

**Mechanism of Action:** Eribulin mesylate inhibits microtubule dynamics by binding to the growing plus end, suppressing microtubule growth without affecting shortening. This leads to G2/M cell-cycle arrest, ultimately resulting in apoptosis (programmed cell death) of cancer cells.

## **Alternate Names**

*   Eribulin
*   Halaven (brand name)

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Eribulin mesylate exerts its antitumor activity by inhibiting microtubule dynamics, specifically by binding to the plus ends of microtubules and suppressing their growth without significant impact on microtubule shortening. This mechanism differs from other tubulin-targeting agents.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Following intravenous administration, eribulin exhibits rapid distribution.
*   **Metabolism:** Primarily hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4, but this pathway is not considered clinically significant for drug interactions.
*   **Elimination:** Primarily through biliary excretion into the feces, with minimal renal excretion.

**Mode of Action:** Eribulin binds to the vinca-binding site on tubulin, inhibiting microtubule polymerization. This mechanism of action differs from that of other tubulin-targeting agents, as it predominantly suppresses microtubule growth without affecting shortening, leading to irreversible mitotic blockage and apoptosis.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Eribulin specifically binds to the vinca alkaloid-binding site on tubulin. While it undergoes some CYP3A4 metabolism, this pathway is not considered clinically relevant regarding drug interactions, and Eribulin is neither an inhibitor nor an inducer of CYP enzymes.

**Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly biliary excretion into the feces. Less than 10% is eliminated in the urine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   1.23 mg/m² (equivalent to 1.4 mg/m² eribulin mesylate), IV, over 2–5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.
* The dose is calculated based on the body surface area (BSA) and the concentration of the ready-to-use solution (0.44 mg/mL eribulin base).

#### **Children:**

The safety and efficacy of eribulin in pediatric patients have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustments are recommended based on age alone.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment (moderate or severe, creatinine clearance 15 to 49 mL/min):** 1.1 mg/m² IV on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction (mild impairment, Child-Pugh A):** 1.1 mg/m² IV on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction (moderate impairment, Child-Pugh B):** 0.7 mg/m² IV on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.
*   **Patients with severe Hepatic Dysfunction (Child-Pugh C):**  Eribulin is not recommended.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Eribulin mesylate is not indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its use is limited to the specific indications mentioned above.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient factors like renal or hepatic impairment, tolerability, and blood counts.  Close monitoring of blood counts is crucial during therapy.

*   **Dosage:** 1.23 mg/m² IV on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle (adjust for hepatic/renal impairment).
*   **Monitoring Parameters:** Complete blood counts (CBC) before each dose, liver function tests (LFTs), ECG (especially in patients at risk of QT prolongation), and monitor for signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.

## **Popular Combinations**

Eribulin is generally used as a single agent.  Combinations with other chemotherapy drugs are not routinely recommended.

*   Monitor for peripheral neuropathy.
*   Monitor ECGs for patients at risk for QT prolongation.
*   Monitor liver function tests.
*   Patients should use effective contraception.
