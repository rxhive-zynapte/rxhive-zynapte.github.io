## **Usage**

- Erlotinib is prescribed for the treatment of certain types of **non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)** and **pancreatic cancer**.  Specifically, it's used:
    - As maintenance therapy for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose disease hasn't progressed after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.
    - To treat locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen.
    - As first-line treatment, in combination with gemcitabine, for locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic pancreatic cancer.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Erlotinib is a **tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)**, specifically an **epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)** inhibitor.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Erlotinib reversibly binds to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding site of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain, inhibiting its autophosphorylation and downstream signaling pathways crucial for cancer cell growth, proliferation, and survival.  It has highest activity against tumors with activating mutations in EGFR.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Erlotinib
- **Brand Name:** Tarceva


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Erlotinib selectively targets EGFR tyrosine kinase in cancer cells, leading to inhibition of cell growth, proliferation, and angiogenesis, and promoting apoptosis.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Administered orally, it is well absorbed with peak plasma concentrations reached after approximately 4 hours. Food may delay absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4, with minor contributions from CYP1A2 and CYP1A1.  An active metabolite, OSI-420, is formed.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily excreted in the feces (>90%), with a small portion (<9%) excreted in urine.  The terminal half-life is approximately 36 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Erlotinib competitively inhibits ATP binding to the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR, thereby blocking downstream signaling pathways involved in cancer cell growth and proliferation.
- **Receptor Binding:** Binds reversibly and highly selectively to the ATP-binding site of EGFR tyrosine kinase.
- **Enzyme Inhibition:** Inhibits EGFR tyrosine kinase activity.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4 followed by biliary excretion and elimination in feces.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **NSCLC:** 150 mg orally once daily, taken on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after food).
- **Pancreatic Cancer:** 100 mg orally once daily, taken on an empty stomach, in combination with gemcitabine.

#### **Children:**

- Use and dose must be determined by a doctor experienced in pediatric oncology. Based on previous clinical trials, a dose of 85 mg/mÂ²/day is recommended for recurrent pediatric solid tumors.  Safety and efficacy have not been fully established in pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is typically required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment required for mild to moderate impairment. Use with caution in severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution; dose reduction may be considered. Not recommended in severe hepatic dysfunction.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with pre-existing lung disease, cardiac conditions, or those taking medications known to interact with erlotinib.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Erlotinib is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its primary role is in targeted therapy for specific cancers.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose reductions (usually in 50 mg decrements) may be necessary for managing side effects like rash, diarrhea, or other adverse reactions.
- Consider dose adjustments for patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment or those taking interacting medications.
