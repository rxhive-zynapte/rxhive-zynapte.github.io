## **Usage**

Estradiol valerate is prescribed for various conditions related to estrogen deficiency.  It is primarily used in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopausal symptoms (e.g., hot flashes, vaginal dryness) and low estrogen levels.  Other uses include HRT for transgender women, treatment of prostate cancer, and as a component in some hormonal birth control formulations.  It is classified as an estrogen, a steroidal sex hormone. Estradiol valerate acts as a prodrug of estradiol.  After administration, it is metabolized into estradiol, which then binds to and activates estrogen receptors throughout the body, leading to various physiological effects.

## **Alternate Names**

Estradiol valerate is sometimes referred to as oestradiol valerate (using British English spelling).  Brand names under which estradiol valerate is marketed include Progynova (oral), Delestrogen (injection), and Progynon Depot (injection). Other brands may exist depending on region and country.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Estradiol valerate is a prodrug of estradiol. After administration, it is rapidly hydrolyzed to estradiol. Estradiol exerts its effects by binding to estrogen receptors (ERs), which are located in various tissues throughout the body, including the reproductive organs, breast, bone, brain, liver, and cardiovascular system.  This binding leads to changes in gene expression, influencing a wide range of physiological processes, such as cell growth and differentiation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Estradiol valerate, administered intramuscularly, is absorbed from the injection site and quickly converted to estradiol. Estradiol is highly protein-bound in the bloodstream, primarily to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin.  It undergoes hepatic metabolism, involving primarily CYP3A4 enzymes.  Metabolites include estrone and estriol, which also have estrogenic activity, although less potent than estradiol. Elimination is primarily through renal excretion of glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.

**Mode of Action:**  Estradiol's mode of action involves binding to estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ), leading to receptor dimerization and translocation to the nucleus.  The estradiol-receptor complex then binds to specific DNA sequences called estrogen response elements (EREs), regulating the transcription of target genes.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Estradiol primarily exerts its effects through binding to estrogen receptors. While it doesn't directly inhibit enzymes or modulate neurotransmitters in the same way as some other drugs, its influence on gene expression can indirectly affect various enzymatic processes and neuroendocrine pathways.

**Elimination Pathways:** Elimination of estradiol and its metabolites primarily occurs through renal excretion following conjugation with glucuronide and sulfate in the liver.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** For menopausal symptoms, 10 to 20 mg IM every 4 weeks is typical.  For prostate cancer, 30 mg or higher IM every 1 to 2 weeks is common. For transgender women, 5 to 20 mg IM every 2 weeks is a typical starting dose, which can be adjusted up to 40 mg every 2 weeks as needed.

#### **Children:** Estradiol valerate is generally not recommended for use in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Although dose adjustments are not typically required, monitoring for adverse effects is essential due to potential age-related physiological changes.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution should be exercised.  Dose adjustments may be necessary based on the degree of impairment.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dose adjustments might be needed because estradiol is metabolized in the liver.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Careful consideration is needed for patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, thromboembolic disorders, and liver disease. Dosage adjustments and close monitoring are often necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Estradiol valerate's use in the contexts of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations, primarily relates to its role in managing underlying hormonal imbalances or addressing specific medical needs related to its indications (e.g., controlling bleeding in dysfunctional uterine bleeding).  These uses are not typical and would necessitate individualized dosing.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage modifications are made based on individual patient characteristics, including age, overall health, the severity of symptoms being treated, and response to therapy.  Renal or hepatic dysfunction requires careful consideration. Metabolic disorders and genetic polymorphisms can influence drug metabolism and may necessitate individualized dosing.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:** Nausea, headache, breast tenderness, bloating, weight changes, mood swings.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**  Thromboembolic events (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, myocardial infarction), gallbladder disease, liver dysfunction, hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., rash, angioedema), hypertriglyceridemia,  hyperprolactinemia.


### **Long-Term Effects:** Increased risk of endometrial cancer (in women with a uterus who are not receiving a progestogen), breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and possibly dementia with prolonged use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Severe allergic reactions, thromboembolic complications, jaundice, significant changes in liver function tests, and uncontrolled hypertension.


## **Contraindications**

- Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding
- Known, suspected, or history of breast cancer, estrogen-dependent neoplasia, endometrial cancer, or ovarian cancer
- Active or recent arterial thromboembolic disease (e.g., stroke, myocardial infarction), venous thromboembolism (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism)
- Liver dysfunction or disease, including tumors
- Known hypersensitivity to estradiol valerate or any of its components
- Pregnancy


## **Drug Interactions**

Estradiol valerate interacts with several medications.  CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine) can decrease estradiol levels. CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole) can increase estradiol levels.  It can also interact with anticoagulants, anticonvulsants, and some antidepressants.  Alcohol, smoking, and grapefruit juice may also affect estradiol metabolism.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Estradiol valerate is contraindicated during pregnancy (Pregnancy Category X).  It can cause harm to the developing fetus.  It is also not recommended during breastfeeding as it can decrease milk production and may be excreted in breast milk, potentially exposing the infant to estradiol.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Binds to and activates estrogen receptors.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, headache, breast tenderness, thromboembolic events, endometrial hyperplasia.
- **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, breast cancer, thromboembolic disorders, liver disease.
- **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors, anticoagulants.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
- **Dosage:** Varies depending on indication and route of administration (see detailed dosage guidelines).
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests, blood pressure, lipid profile, endometrial thickness (for women with a uterus receiving HRT).


## **Popular Combinations**

Estradiol valerate is often combined with a progestogen (e.g., medroxyprogesterone acetate, norethisterone) in women with an intact uterus to mitigate the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.  The specific progestogen and regimen (cyclic or continuous) depend on individual patient factors.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Pre-screening for relevant contraindications, monitoring for side effects.
- **Specific Populations:** See Dosage section.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Limit alcohol consumption, avoid smoking.  Driving restrictions are generally not necessary unless side effects impair cognitive function.
