      effective for treating vulvovaginal atrophy. Other forms of hormone
      therapy may be more appropriate for managing other menopausal symptoms.

## **Usage**

Estriol is primarily prescribed for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy (vaginal dryness and irritation) due to estrogen deficiency in postmenopausal women. It can also be used before and after vaginal surgery to improve tissue health.  It is classified as an estrogen, a type of hormone replacement therapy (HRT).  Estriol's mechanism of action involves binding to estrogen receptors in the vaginal tissues, promoting cellular growth and restoring vaginal moisture and elasticity.

## **Alternate Names**

Estriol is also known as oestriol and E3.  Brand names include Ovestin, Ortho-Estriol, and Gynäsan.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Estriol exerts its effects by binding to estrogen receptors in target tissues, particularly in the vagina.  This binding leads to increased blood flow, glycogen deposition, and thickening of the vaginal epithelium, improving vaginal lubrication and elasticity.  

**Pharmacokinetics:**  When administered vaginally, estriol is absorbed directly into the local tissues, with minimal systemic absorption. This minimizes the impact on other organs and reduces the risk of systemic side effects associated with estrogens.  Estriol is metabolized primarily in the liver and excreted mainly in the urine.

**Mode of Action:** Estriol acts as an agonist at estrogen receptors, primarily ERα and ERβ,  stimulating gene transcription and protein synthesis related to vaginal tissue health.

**Elimination Pathways:** Estriol undergoes hepatic metabolism and is primarily excreted in the urine, with a small amount eliminated in the feces.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Vulvovaginal Atrophy:** Initially, 0.5 mg (one applicator full of 1 mg/g cream or one 500 mcg pessary) intravaginally daily for 2-3 weeks.  The dose can then be reduced to 0.5 mg twice weekly for maintenance.

#### **Children:**

Estriol is not indicated for use in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically required for elderly patients.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution is advised in patients with severe renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider individual patient factors and comorbidities when determining the appropriate dose and duration of treatment.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Estriol's primary clinical use is for vulvovaginal atrophy.  Its use in other clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations is not established.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient response and the presence of renal or hepatic impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Vaginal itching or irritation
* Increased vaginal discharge
* Breast tenderness or pain
* Headache
* Nausea


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism)
* Stroke
* Heart attack
* Liver problems
* Gallbladder disease
* Hypersensitivity reactions (rash, itching, hives, angioedema)


### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term use of estriol, especially in oral formulations, may be associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Regular monitoring and the lowest effective dose are recommended.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs include hypersensitivity reactions, thromboembolic events, and abnormal vaginal bleeding, which necessitate immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

* Known or suspected breast cancer
* Estrogen-dependent neoplasia (e.g., endometrial cancer)
* Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding
* Untreated endometrial hyperplasia
* Active or past venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism)
* Active or recent arterial thromboembolic disease (stroke, myocardial infarction)
* Liver dysfunction
* Porphyria
* Hypersensitivity to estriol


## **Drug Interactions**

Estriol may interact with several medications, including certain antivirals, antifungals, anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants, antibiotics, and corticosteroids.  It can also interact with St. John's wort.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Estriol is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Estrogens can be transferred to breast milk and potentially affect milk production and infant development.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Binds to estrogen receptors in the vagina, restoring vaginal tissue health.
* **Side Effects:** Vaginal irritation, breast tenderness, headache, nausea. Serious side effects include blood clots and endometrial cancer risk.
* **Contraindications:** Breast cancer, estrogen-dependent neoplasia, thromboembolic disease, pregnancy, breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Interacts with some antivirals, antifungals, anticonvulsants, and other medications.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
* **Dosage:** 0.5 mg intravaginally daily initially, then reduced to twice weekly.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Endometrial thickness (if applicable), monitor for signs of thromboembolism and breast changes.


## **Popular Combinations**

Estriol is typically used alone for vulvovaginal atrophy.  Combined estrogen-progestogen preparations are generally avoided for this indication to minimize systemic exposure and side effects.


## **Precautions**

* Assess for contraindications and risk factors before initiating treatment.
* Monitor for adverse effects and endometrial changes.
* Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.
* Advise patients on proper administration techniques.
