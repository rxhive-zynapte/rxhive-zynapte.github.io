## **Usage**

Etanercept is prescribed for the treatment of:

*   **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA):**  A chronic inflammatory disorder affecting joints.
*   **Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA):** A chronic inflammatory joint disease affecting children.
*   **Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA):**  A type of arthritis associated with psoriasis.
*   **Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS):** A type of arthritis that primarily affects the spine.
*   **Non-Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA):**  Inflammatory back pain with no radiographic evidence of AS.
*   **Plaque Psoriasis:** A chronic skin condition characterized by red, raised, scaly patches.
*   **Paediatric Plaque Psoriasis:** Plaque psoriasis in children.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) inhibitor, Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), Biologic.

**Mechanism of Action:** Etanercept works by binding to TNF-alpha, a cytokine involved in inflammatory processes. By neutralizing TNF-alpha, etanercept reduces inflammation and thus alleviates symptoms of the aforementioned conditions.


## **Alternate Names**

International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Etanercept

**Brand Names:** Enbrel

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Etanercept binds specifically to TNF-alpha, preventing it from interacting with its cell surface receptors. This inhibits TNF-alpha mediated cellular responses, leading to a decrease in inflammation.

**Pharmacokinetics:** 

*   **Absorption:** Administered subcutaneously; bioavailability is approximately 76%.
*   **Metabolism:**  Not extensively metabolized.
*   **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through slow clearance with a terminal half-life of approximately 70 hours. It appears that the drug is eliminated through a combination of processes, including intracellular catabolism and extracellular degradation.

**Mode of Action:** Binds to TNF-alpha, inhibiting its interaction with p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. This prevents TNF-alpha-mediated cellular responses, leading to decreased inflammation and immune modulation.

**Receptor Binding:**  Binds to soluble and transmembrane forms of TNF-alpha.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily involves proteolytic degradation in serum and intracellular catabolism.  Renal and hepatic elimination is minimal.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   **RA, PsA, AS, nr-axSpA:** 50 mg subcutaneously once weekly or 25 mg subcutaneously twice weekly (3-4 days apart).
*   **Plaque Psoriasis:** 50 mg subcutaneously twice weekly for 12 weeks, then 50 mg once weekly or 25 mg twice weekly.  An alternative dosing is 50mg or 25mg once weekly, depending on efficacy of initial treatment.

#### **Children:**

*   **JIA (≥2 years):** 0.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 25 mg per dose) subcutaneously twice weekly (3-4 days apart) or 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) subcutaneously once weekly.
*   **Paediatric Plaque Psoriasis (≥4 years):** 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) subcutaneously once weekly.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment required.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment required.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment required.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Dose adjustments may be needed depending on the specific comorbidity.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Etanercept is not typically used in acute clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  It is a long-term treatment for chronic inflammatory conditions.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific dosage adjustments are required based on renal or hepatic function. Dosage modifications may be necessary in patients with certain comorbidities or in case of adverse events.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

*   **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  B (Animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus, and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.)
*   Caution advised during pregnancy; use only if clearly needed.
*   Etanercept is present in human milk. Women using etanercept should discuss risks and benefits with their physicians.
