## **Usage**

- Ethacridine is an antiseptic and disinfectant primarily used for the topical treatment of minor wounds and skin infections. It has also been used in some regions for second-trimester abortions via extra-amniotic administration, though this usage has largely been replaced by safer and more effective methods.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Antiseptic, disinfectant, abortifacient (historical).
- **Mechanism of action:** Ethacridine inhibits bacterial growth by interfering with DNA replication and other cellular processes in susceptible microorganisms, primarily gram-positive bacteria.


## **Alternate Names**

- Acrinol
- Rivanol


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ethacridine exerts a bactericidal effect primarily on gram-positive bacteria.  It inhibits bacterial DNA replication and other cellular processes.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Topical application limits systemic absorption. When administered extra-amniotically, absorption is slow.  Specific details on metabolism and elimination pathways are limited.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Topical:** Apply a 0.1% solution or cream to the affected area as needed.


#### **Children:**

- Topical use in children should be under the guidance of a healthcare professional.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required for topical use.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are required for topical use due to limited systemic absorption.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are required for topical use.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  No specific adjustments are generally needed for topical use.



### **Clinical Use Cases**


The following dosages are based on historical usage and are not generally recommended in current practice. Safer and more effective alternatives are typically preferred.

- **Intubation:** Not applicable for current standard practice.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Not applicable for current standard practice.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not applicable for current standard practice.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Not applicable for current standard practice.
- **Emergency Situations:** Not applicable for current standard practice.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dosage adjustments are generally not needed for topical use.  For historical extra-amniotic use in abortion, the dose was sometimes based on gestational age. This practice is not currently recommended.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
- Local skin irritation (burning, itching, redness).


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, swelling).



### **Long-Term Effects**

- Prolonged topical use may delay wound healing.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to ethacridine.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Incompatible with chlorine-containing solutions, chlorides, iodides, phenol, iodine preparations, and alkaline drugs. Concomitant use with other topical agents should be avoided.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Ethacridine has historically been used for second-trimester abortions.  However, this practice is largely obsolete due to safer and more effective methods being available.  Topical use during pregnancy should be limited and only under the guidance of a doctor.
- **Breastfeeding:** Limited information is available about excretion in breast milk. Topical use during breastfeeding should be done with caution and under the guidance of a doctor.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial DNA replication and cellular processes.
- **Side Effects:** Local skin irritation, allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:** Incompatible with various solutions and medications.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Limited safety information, topical use with caution. Consult with a healthcare professional.
- **Dosage:** Topical: Apply 0.1% solution/cream to the affected area.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for local skin reactions and signs of infection.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Combinations are generally not recommended.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Avoid contact with eyes. Discontinue use if irritation or allergic reaction occurs.
- **Specific Populations:** Use cautiously during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Consult with a healthcare professional.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** None specifically identified.
