## **Usage**

Ethambutol is a bacteriostatic antimycobacterial drug primarily used for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB). It is prescribed in combination with other anti-TB medications to prevent the development of drug resistance.  It is effective against *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, as well as some atypical mycobacteria, like *Mycobacterium avium complex* (MAC). Ethambutol is categorized as an antimycobacterial agent.

Ethambutol's mechanism of action involves inhibiting arabinosyl transferases. These enzymes are crucial for the biosynthesis of arabinogalactan, a key component of the mycobacterial cell wall. By disrupting arabinogalactan production, ethambutol weakens the cell wall, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely used alternate names for Ethambutol. A common brand name is Myambutol.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ethambutol exhibits bacteriostatic activity specifically against mycobacteria.  It primarily targets actively growing mycobacteria by disrupting cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death.  This effect is concentration-dependent, with higher concentrations exhibiting more pronounced effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Ethambutol is well-absorbed orally, with peak plasma concentrations reached within 2-4 hours after administration. Food does not significantly affect its absorption.
* **Distribution:** It distributes widely throughout the body, achieving therapeutic levels in most tissues and organs, but it does not readily penetrate the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
* **Metabolism:**  Ethambutol undergoes minimal metabolism in the liver.  A small fraction is converted to inactive metabolites.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated by the kidneys, with about 80% of an oral dose excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 hours. The elimination half-life is approximately 3-4 hours in individuals with normal renal function, but it can increase significantly in patients with renal impairment.


**Mode of Action:** Ethambutol inhibits arabinosyl transferases, enzymes essential for the biosynthesis of arabinogalactan, a crucial component of the mycobacterial cell wall. This inhibition disrupts cell wall integrity, leading to bacterial death. It does not exhibit receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation outside its primary target.

**Elimination:**  Predominantly excreted unchanged through renal mechanisms.  A small portion is metabolized to inactive metabolites.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Initial Treatment:** 15 mg/kg orally once daily. Alternatively, 50 mg/kg twice weekly or 25-30 mg/kg three times weekly.
* **Retreatment:** 25 mg/kg orally once daily for the first 60 days, then reduced to 15 mg/kg once daily.
* **Maximum daily dose:** Generally not to exceed 2.5g, although higher doses may be used in some cases based on clinical judgment.

#### **Children (13 years and older):**  Dosing recommendations are the same as for adults.

#### **Children (younger than 13 years):** Dosing recommendations vary. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) suggests 15-25 mg/kg/day, not exceeding 1 g/day.  Some guidelines recommend 50 mg/kg twice weekly, not to exceed 2.5 g/dose. Due to the risk of optic neuritis, it is not generally recommended for children unable to report vision changes.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose reduction and/or increased dosing interval based on creatinine clearance is necessary.  Thrice-weekly administration is often recommended.  Therapeutic drug monitoring is advisable.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Generally, no dosage adjustment is required, but careful monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate on a case-by-case basis, considering potential drug interactions and disease-specific considerations.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Ethambutol is typically used in combination with other anti-TB drugs for the treatment of active TB. It does not have specific dosing recommendations for scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations outside the context of tuberculosis treatment.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments are based on renal function, age, and other individual factors.  Therapeutic drug monitoring may be useful.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of appetite)
* Headache
* Dizziness

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Optic neuritis (decreased visual acuity, blurred vision, color blindness, scotoma, visual field defects)
* Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling, burning in extremities)
* Hepatotoxicity
* Allergic reactions
* Mental confusion, disorientation, hallucinations

### **Long-Term Effects:**  Optic neuritis can be irreversible if not detected and addressed promptly.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Optic neuritis, hepatotoxicity, and severe allergic reactions require urgent attention.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to ethambutol
* Known optic neuritis (unless clinical judgment dictates otherwise)
* Inability to report vision changes (e.g., young children, unconscious patients)

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Aluminum-containing antacids:** Reduce ethambutol absorption. Administer at least 4 hours apart.
* **Other anti-TB drugs:** Monitor for overlapping toxicities.
* **Drugs affecting uric acid levels (e.g., allopurinol, probenecid):** May increase risk of gout.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Ethambutol is generally considered safe during pregnancy (Pregnancy Category C).  While animal studies have shown some teratogenic effects at high doses, human data does not suggest a significant risk.  It is excreted in breast milk at low levels and is generally compatible with breastfeeding.  Monitor infants for jaundice.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits arabinosyl transferases, disrupting mycobacterial cell wall synthesis.
* **Side Effects:** Optic neuritis, peripheral neuropathy, gastrointestinal upset, hepatotoxicity.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, optic neuritis, inability to report visual changes.
* **Drug Interactions:** Aluminum antacids, other anti-TB drugs, drugs affecting uric acid levels.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe; monitor infants for jaundice.
* **Dosage:** 15-25 mg/kg/day (adjust for renal impairment).
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Visual acuity, liver function tests, renal function tests.


## **Popular Combinations:** Ethambutol is most commonly used in combination with isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide for the initial treatment of tuberculosis.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Baseline visual acuity assessment, monitor for vision changes throughout treatment, assess renal and hepatic function.
* **Specific Populations (as noted above).**
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Alcohol should be avoided due to the potential for increased liver toxicity.
