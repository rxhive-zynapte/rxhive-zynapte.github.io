## **Usage**

- Ethylmorphine is prescribed for the treatment of whooping cough and occasionally for mild to moderate pain and dry cough.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Opioid analgesic, Antitussive.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Ethylmorphine acts primarily as an agonist at mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system, similarly to codeine and morphine. This leads to decreased pain perception and suppression of the cough reflex. It also interacts with kappa and delta opioid receptors to a lesser extent. It is metabolized to morphine in the liver via CYP2D6 which is thought to contribute to its analgesic effect. 

## **Alternate Names**

- Dionine
- Ethomorphine
- Ethylmorphine Hydrochloride
- Codethyline (in combination with codeine)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ethylmorphine binds to mu-opioid receptors in the brain, spinal cord, and other tissues, inhibiting pain signal transmission and reducing the cough reflex.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Ethylmorphine is administered orally and is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP2D6 to morphine, which contributes to its analgesic effect. Ultra-rapid metabolizers of CYP2D6 are at risk for opioid toxicity, even with typical doses. Ethylmorphine is excreted primarily in the urine.
- **Mode of Action:** Binds to mu-opioid receptors, inhibiting adenylate cyclase and decreasing intracellular cAMP, which leads to hyperpolarization of neurons and reduced neuronal excitability. This inhibits pain transmission and cough reflex.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion; hepatic metabolism via CYP2D6.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 5-10 mL (12.5-25 mg ethylmorphine) three to four times daily.
- Maximum daily dose: Should not exceed recommendations from other similar products which range from 45-120 mg per day.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for children under 2 years old.
- 2-5 years: 1-2.5 mL (2.5–6.25 mg ethylmorphine) three times daily.
- 6-10 years: 2.5 mL (6.25 mg ethylmorphine) three times daily.
- 11-12 years: 3.5 mL (8.75 mg ethylmorphine) three times daily.
- 13-17 years (over 40 kg): 5 mL (12.5 mg ethylmorphine) three to four times daily.
- **Pediatric Safety Considerations:** Use with extreme caution in children due to the risk of respiratory depression.  Avoid use in children younger than two years. Not recommended for children under 12 years in some jurisdictions.  Not recommended for use in children aged 12 to 18 years with compromised respiratory function.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Reduce dosage due to potential for impaired hepatic or renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Administer with caution; dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Administer with caution; dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with respiratory conditions (e.g., asthma, COPD), obstructive sleep apnea, neuromuscular diseases, severe heart or lung conditions, and those with a history of substance abuse.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Ethylmorphine's clinical use is primarily limited to whooping cough.  Its use in other clinical settings, such as those below, is not supported by current guidelines and practice:

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations** (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest)

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Reduce dosage in elderly patients and those with renal or hepatic impairment.
- Ultra-rapid metabolizers of CYP2D6 should avoid ethylmorphine due to increased risk of morphine toxicity.

- **MAOIs:** Concomitant use is not recommended.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** There is no established FDA pregnancy safety category for ethylmorphine. 
- **Fetal Risks:**  Potential for fetal respiratory depression and neonatal withdrawal syndrome. Use only if clearly necessary and the benefits outweigh the risks. Not recommended after week 20 of pregnancy in some jurisdictions.
- **Breastfeeding:** Ethylmorphine passes into breast milk. Use only if clearly necessary and if the benefits outweigh the risks. Monitor infant for adverse effects. Not recommended in some jurisdictions.
