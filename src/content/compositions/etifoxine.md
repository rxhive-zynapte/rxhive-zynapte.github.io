      benzodiazepines.

## **Usage**

Etifoxine hydrochloride is prescribed for the treatment of adjustment disorder with anxiety (ADWA), also known as situational anxiety or stress-related anxiety. It is also used for the management of psychosomatic manifestations of anxiety, such as autonomic nervous system imbalances, particularly those with cardiovascular symptoms.  It is classified as a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic. Although it is not a benzodiazepine, it acts on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor complex, enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission, similar to benzodiazepines. It also stimulates the production of neurosteroids, further enhancing GABAergic activity.  

## **Alternate Names**

Etifoxine hydrochloride is also known as etafenoxine. Brand names include Stresam.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Etifoxine acts primarily on the central nervous system by enhancing the activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. It achieves this through a dual mechanism: directly, by acting as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor complex, and indirectly, by stimulating the synthesis of 3α-reduced neurosteroids, endogenous positive allosteric modulators of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. This dual action results in increased inhibitory neurotransmission, reducing neuronal excitability and producing an anxiolytic effect.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Etifoxine is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentration in 2–3 hours. It has high bioavailability (approximately 90%) and doesn't bind to blood cells, but it strongly binds to plasma proteins (88–95%). Etifoxine is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily via CYP3A4, producing several metabolites, including diethyl-etifoxine, which is also active. It is primarily eliminated through the kidneys, with a triphasic elimination profile.  It crosses the placental barrier.

**Mode of Action:** Etifoxine binds to a specific site on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor complex, distinct from the benzodiazepine binding site, enhancing the receptor's sensitivity to GABA. This binding increases the frequency of chloride channel opening, leading to hyperpolarization of the neuron and reduced neuronal excitability. Additionally, etifoxine stimulates the synthesis of neurosteroids, which further enhance GABAergic activity.  This indirect action on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors via TSPO is likely responsible for some of etifoxine's neuroprotective, neuroplastic, and anti-inflammatory properties.

**Elimination Pathways:** Etifoxine and its metabolites are mainly excreted in urine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The usual dosage is 150-200 mg/day, divided into two or three doses (e.g., 50 mg three times a day or 50 mg twice a day plus 100 mg in the evening).  The maximum recommended treatment duration is 12 weeks.

#### **Children:**  Etifoxine is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to a lack of safety and efficacy data.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Start with a lower dose (e.g., 50 mg twice a day) and titrate slowly as needed, considering age-related changes in renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be required based on the degree of impairment. In patients with severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min), etifoxine is not recommended.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment may be required, particularly in moderate to severe impairment.  Close monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised in patients with pre-existing conditions like myasthenia gravis, respiratory failure, or galactosemia.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Etifoxine does not have established indications or dosage recommendations for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary use is in the management of adjustment disorder with anxiety and related psychosomatic manifestations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments should be considered based on individual patient response, tolerability, and the presence of renal or hepatic impairment. Start with a lower dose and titrate gradually upwards as needed.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

The most common side effect is drowsiness, which usually occurs in the initial stages of treatment and tends to resolve with continued use. Other reported common side effects include headache, dizziness, and nausea.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Rare but serious side effects include skin rashes, urticaria, angioedema, hepatitis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. These require immediate medical attention.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

There is limited data on long-term effects of etifoxine use beyond 12 weeks.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Clinically significant ADRs include severe skin reactions, hepatic dysfunction, and hypersensitivity reactions.


## **Contraindications**

Etifoxine is contraindicated in:

* Hypersensitivity to etifoxine or any of its components.
* Shock
* Myasthenia gravis
* Severe hepatic impairment
* Severe renal impairment
* Respiratory failure
* Galactosemia


## **Drug Interactions**

Etifoxine may potentiate the effects of other central nervous system depressants, such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, and some antihistamines. It can also interact with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, as etifoxine is both a substrate and an inducer of this enzyme. Co-administration with CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase etifoxine levels, while co-administration with CYP3A4 inducers may decrease etifoxine levels.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Etifoxine is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant or breastfeeding women, and the drug's potential benefits do not outweigh the potential risks to the fetus or neonate.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Enhances GABAergic neurotransmission via direct positive allosteric modulation of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor complex and indirect stimulation of neurosteroid synthesis.
* **Side Effects:**  Drowsiness (common), skin rash, hepatitis (rare).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, shock, myasthenia gravis, severe hepatic/renal impairment, respiratory failure, galactosemia, pregnancy, breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** CNS depressants, CYP3A4 substrates/inhibitors/inducers.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 150-200 mg/day divided into 2-3 doses; maximum 12 weeks. Children: Not recommended.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests, signs of hypersensitivity reactions.

## **Popular Combinations**

There are no widely established popular combinations of etifoxine with other medications.

## **Precautions**

* Assess patients for allergies, hepatic or renal dysfunction before initiating treatment.
* Monitor for signs of drowsiness and other adverse effects.
* Advise patients against concurrent alcohol consumption.
* Caution is necessary in elderly patients due to altered drug metabolism.
* Avoid abrupt discontinuation; taper the dose gradually.
