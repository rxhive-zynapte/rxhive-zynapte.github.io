## **Usage**

Etodolac is prescribed for the management of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and acute pain.  It is also indicated for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) in children 6 years and older.

It's pharmacologically classified as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).

Etodolac works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, primarily COX-2, responsible for producing prostaglandins, which are mediators of pain and inflammation.

## **Alternate Names**

Etodolac is the generic name. Brand names include Lodine®, Lodine XL®.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Etodolac exerts its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting COX enzymes, predominantly COX-2.  This action reduces the production of prostaglandins, key mediators of pain and inflammation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Etodolac is well-absorbed orally. Food may delay but doesn't significantly affect the extent of absorption. Antacids may decrease peak plasma concentrations.
* **Metabolism:**  Etodolac is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 enzymes, into inactive metabolites.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through renal excretion of metabolites, with a small portion excreted in feces. The terminal half-life is approximately 6-7 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Etodolac binds to and inhibits COX enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis. It shows a preference for COX-2 inhibition, which may contribute to a lower risk of gastrointestinal side effects compared to some other NSAIDs.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Etodolac's primary mechanism is the inhibition of COX enzymes, particularly COX-2.

**Elimination Pathways:** Etodolac is predominantly eliminated through renal excretion of metabolites, with a minor contribution from fecal excretion.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Pain:** 200-400 mg every 6-8 hours as needed, not exceeding 1000 mg/day (immediate-release). 400-1000 mg once daily (extended-release), not exceeding 1200 mg/day.
* **Osteoarthritis/Rheumatoid Arthritis:** 600-1000 mg/day in divided doses (immediate-release) or 400-1000 mg once daily (extended-release).  For long-term use, 600 mg/day may be sufficient.


#### **Children (JRA):**  (Extended-release only)

* **6-16 years:**  Dosage based on weight (see below).  Conventional tablets not recommended.
* **<6 years:** Safety and efficacy not established.



#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and monitor closely due to increased risk of adverse effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Mild to moderate impairment generally doesn't require dosage adjustment, but caution is advised. Severe impairment: not recommended.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dosage adjustment usually not necessary, but monitor closely.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or other relevant conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Etodolac's use in the settings of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations hasn't been specifically detailed.  Postoperative pain would be a clinical scenario where Etodolac might be considered.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be required in elderly patients, those with renal or hepatic impairment, and individuals with certain comorbid conditions. Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism may also warrant dosage adjustments.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dyspepsia, flatulence, headache, dizziness, rash, itching.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, perforation, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, renal failure, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic kidney disease, gastrointestinal issues, cardiovascular events.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Anaphylaxis, angioedema, hepatotoxicity, severe skin reactions.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to etodolac or other NSAIDs.
* History of asthma, urticaria, or allergic reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.
* Peri-operative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
* Active peptic ulcer disease.




## **Drug Interactions**

* **Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin):** Increased risk of bleeding.
* **Antihypertensives:** May reduce the effectiveness of blood pressure medications.
* **Aspirin and other NSAIDs:** Increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects.
* **Corticosteroids:** Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcers.
* **Methotrexate:** Increased risk of methotrexate toxicity.
* **Lithium:** May increase lithium levels.
* **CYP450 Interactions:** Etodolac is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9; inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes may alter etodolac levels.
* **Alcohol:** Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.




## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  C (first and second trimesters). Contraindicated in the third trimester due to risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.
* **Fetal Risks:**  May cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus, fetal renal dysfunction, oligohydramnios, neonatal renal impairment.
* **Breastfeeding:** It is not known if etodolac is excreted in breast milk.  Use with caution.  Consider the risks and benefits.




## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** COX inhibitor, preferentially COX-2.
* **Side Effects:** Common: GI upset, headache, dizziness. Serious: GI bleeding, cardiovascular events, renal impairment.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to NSAIDs, recent MI, CABG surgery.
* **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, antihypertensives, other NSAIDs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid in the third trimester. Caution during breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** See detailed section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, liver function, blood pressure.




## **Popular Combinations**

Combinations with other pain medications or with gastroprotective agents may be used, though use caution with additional NSAIDs like aspirin.



## **Precautions**


* **General Precautions:** Assess for allergies, history of GI bleeding, cardiovascular disease, renal/hepatic impairment.
* **Specific Populations:** As detailed above.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid alcohol, smoking cessation recommended.
