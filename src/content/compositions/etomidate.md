## **Usage**

- Etomidate is primarily used for the induction of general anesthesia for short procedures. It is particularly useful for patients with compromised cardiovascular function due to its minimal hemodynamic effects. Off-label uses include procedural sedation and, in intensive care, the suppression of steroidogenesis in severe Cushing's syndrome.
- **Pharmacological classification:**  Hypnotic, general anesthetic, short-acting sedative-hypnotic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Etomidate enhances the inhibitory effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by binding to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in the central nervous system. This leads to increased chloride ion influx, hyperpolarization of neurons, and suppression of the reticular activating system, resulting in hypnosis and anesthesia.

## **Alternate Names**

- Etomidate is the generic name.
- **Brand names:** Amidate, Hypnomidate, Etomidat-Lipuro.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Etomidate depresses the reticular activating system, resulting in hypnosis and loss of consciousness. It has minimal cardiovascular and respiratory depressant effects compared to other anesthetic agents.  It also reduces cerebral metabolic rate, cerebral blood flow, and intracranial pressure. Etomidate inhibits 11β-hydroxylase, suppressing adrenal cortisol synthesis.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Rapid onset of action (30-60 seconds) after intravenous administration.
    - **Metabolism:** Rapidly metabolized in the liver by ester hydrolysis and hepatic conjugation.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated via renal excretion of metabolites, with a small amount excreted unchanged in urine.  Elimination half-life is approximately 4-5 hours for the unchanged drug and 2-4 minutes for initial hypnotic effects due to redistribution from the plasma to other tissues.
- **Mode of Action:** Etomidate acts as a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist, enhancing the receptor's affinity for GABA and increasing chloride ion conductance. This hyperpolarizes neurons, leading to decreased neuronal excitability and the hypnotic effect.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism followed by renal excretion of metabolites. A small fraction is excreted unchanged in the urine.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Induction of general anesthesia: 0.2-0.6 mg/kg IV over 30-60 seconds; usual dose is 0.3 mg/kg IV.
- Procedural sedation: 0.1-0.3 mg/kg IV bolus, repeated as needed; Max single dose: 20 mg. Lower doses (0.15mg/kg) may be considered for obtunded patients.

#### **Children:**

- Children > 10 years old: 0.2-0.3 mg/kg IV. Dosages over 0.3 mg/kg have been observed in practice.
- Children < 10 years old: Use is not recommended due to insufficient data. However, 0.2-0.3 mg/kg IV has been used in clinical practice, especially in emergency situations. Pediatric safety considerations: Close monitoring of respiratory and cardiovascular function.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Reduced doses due to age-related decline in renal and hepatic function; initiate with 0.15-0.2 mg/kg and titrate to effect.  Closely monitor cardiovascular function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments; however, monitor renal function and consider reduced doses due to increased risk of toxicity.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments; however, monitor liver function tests and consider reduced doses.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with sepsis, hypovolemia, adrenal insufficiency, or those requiring vasopressor support. Adjust dosage accordingly and monitor closely.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation:** 0.3 mg/kg IV for rapid sequence intubation.  Lower doses (0.15 mg/kg IV) may be used for unstable patients.
- **Surgical Procedures:** 0.2-0.6 mg/kg IV for induction. Smaller supplemental doses may be used during short procedures.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not routinely recommended for prolonged sedation due to adrenal suppression; however, infusions of 0.04-0.1 mg/kg/hour have been used in the ICU with careful monitoring and hydrocortisone supplementation if needed.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** For suppression of steroidogenesis in Cushing's syndrome: 0.04-0.1 mg/kg/hour continuous IV infusion.  Very low starting doses (0.02 mg/kg/h) have been utilized outside the ICU, with titration to achieve target cortisol levels.
- **Emergency Situations:**  0.3 mg/kg IV bolus for rapid sequence intubation in unstable patients.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjust dosage based on patient's response, age, physical status, and co-existing medical conditions.
- Consider reduced doses for elderly, patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and those with cardiovascular instability.
