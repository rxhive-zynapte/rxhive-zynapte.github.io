## **Usage**

Etoposide is prescribed for the treatment of various types of cancer, including:

*   Testicular cancer
*   Small cell lung cancer
*   Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia
*   Ovarian Cancer
*   Kaposi's sarcoma
*   Ewing sarcoma
*   Acute myeloid leukemia
*   Acute lymphocytic leukemia
*   Germ cell tumor

It is classified as an antineoplastic agent, specifically a topoisomerase II inhibitor.  Etoposide works by disrupting the function of topoisomerase II, an enzyme crucial for DNA replication and cell division. This leads to DNA strand breaks and ultimately prevents the proliferation of cancerous cells.

## **Alternate Names**

Etoposide phosphate (a prodrug form) is sometimes used, and VP-16 is another name for etoposide. Brand names include VePesid, Toposar, and Etopophos.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Etoposide exerts its antitumor effect primarily through the inhibition of topoisomerase II. This enzyme is essential for DNA replication and repair by creating transient breaks in the DNA double helix. Etoposide stabilizes the enzyme-DNA complex, preventing the re-ligation of these breaks.  The resulting DNA damage triggers apoptosis (programmed cell death) in rapidly dividing cancer cells.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Oral bioavailability is variable, ranging from 25-75%, with an average of about 50%. Oral absorption is dose-dependent and might be lower with higher doses.  Food does not significantly affect absorption. Intravenous administration has 100% bioavailability.
*   **Metabolism:**  Etoposide is metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4 enzymes.  It also has active and inactive metabolites.
*   **Elimination:** Etoposide is eliminated through both renal and biliary (fecal) routes, with approximately 45-60% excreted in urine, mostly as unchanged drug.  Biliary excretion contributes to up to 44% of fecal elimination.  The elimination half-life is around 7 hours (range 3-12 hours) after intravenous administration, and approximately 6.8 hours after oral dosing.

**Mode of Action:** Etoposide forms a ternary complex with topoisomerase II and DNA, which prevents the re-ligation of DNA breaks. This DNA damage ultimately leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion (around 45-60%), with some biliary (fecal) excretion (up to 44%).


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   **Intravenous:** 50-100 mg/m²/day for 5 days OR 100 mg/m²/day on days 1, 3, and 5. Repeat cycles every 3-4 weeks.
*   **Oral:** 100-200 mg/m²/day for 5 days OR 200 mg/m²/day on days 1, 3, and 5. Repeat cycles every 3-4 weeks. The oral dose is generally twice the IV dose, rounded to the nearest 50 mg.

#### **Children:**

Dosage recommendations for children vary considerably depending on the specific cancer and treatment protocol. Generally, it is recommended to determine the dose according to local treatment protocol.


#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are required unless renal impairment is present.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** For creatinine clearance between 15-50 mL/min, reduce the dose to 75% of the standard dose. For creatinine clearance below 15 mL/min, dose reduction to 50% or discontinuation is recommended.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** For bilirubin levels between 25-50 µmol/L, use 50% of the normal dose. For bilirubin >50-85 µmol/L, consider reducing the dose to 25%.  If bilirubin is >85, etoposide is generally not recommended.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing for specific clinical situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergencies is determined by the primary cancer treatment protocol and adjusted based on individual patient factors such as renal or hepatic function, concomitant medications, and tolerance to therapy.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications should be based on myelosuppression (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), hepatic or renal function, and concomitant medications.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

*   Myelosuppression (leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia)

*   Diarrhea
*   Loss of appetite

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

*   Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
*   Secondary leukemia
*   Hypotension (low blood pressure) with rapid IV administration
*   Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
*   Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage)

### **Long-Term Effects**

*   Infertility
*   Increased risk of secondary malignancies

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to etoposide or any component of the formulation
*   Severe myelosuppression
*   Severe hepatic impairment

## **Drug Interactions**

Etoposide interacts with numerous medications, including:

*   CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, rifampin) decrease etoposide levels and efficacy.
*   CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole) increase etoposide levels, potentially leading to increased toxicity.
*   Cyclosporine increases etoposide exposure.
*   Cisplatin decreases etoposide clearance.
*   Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin) may have altered effects due to etoposide-induced changes in clotting factors.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Etoposide is contraindicated in pregnancy (Pregnancy Category D) due to its teratogenic effects.  It should also be avoided during breastfeeding.
