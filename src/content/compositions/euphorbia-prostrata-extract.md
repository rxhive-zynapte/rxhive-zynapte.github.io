## **Usage**

Euphorbia Prostrata extract is primarily prescribed for the treatment of hemorrhoids (piles), particularly grades 1 and 2. It is also used to provide symptomatic relief after hemorrhoidectomy in patients with grade 3 and 4 hemorrhoids.  Additionally, it's indicated for other anorectal and colonic diseases. It has been used traditionally, alongside other agents, to manage diabetes. While it has shown some effects on blood glucose levels in studies, it's not classified as an anti-diabetic drug.

It is classified as an herbal remedy with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hemostatic, astringent, and wound-healing properties. When combined with calcium dobesilate, it acts as a vasoprotective and venotonic agent.

Its mechanism of action involves reducing inflammation by modulating inflammatory pathways, protecting cells from free radical damage with its antioxidant properties, shrinking engorged veins, and controlling bleeding by enhancing blood flow.  Furthermore, it decreases blood viscosity and reduces leakage from blood vessels, thus promoting healing. It has also been suggested it blocks pain-causing nerves, though limited information about this is available.

## **Alternate Names**

While no official alternate names exist, it is sometimes referred to as just *Euphorbia prostrata*.  It is available in combination with other drugs, such as Calcium Dobesilate. Brand names in India include "Thank OD" and combination products containing it such as “Sitcom”.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Euphorbia Prostrata extract exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, astringent, and hemostatic properties.  Flavonoids (apigenin, apigenin-7 glucoside, luteolin, and luteolin-7 glucoside), phenolic acids (ellagic and gallic acids), and tannins contribute to these actions. It reduces inflammation, promotes wound healing, and strengthens blood vessel walls.  When used in combination with calcium dobesilate, the synergistic effect enhances vasoprotective and venotonic actions, normalising capillary permeability and inhibiting inflammatory processes.


**Pharmacokinetics:** Limited detailed information is available on the pharmacokinetics of Euphorbia Prostrata extract.  Studies suggest it's absorbed orally and can be applied topically. More research is needed to fully elucidate its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion pathways.  Studies show that there are high MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) and MBC (Minimum Bactericidal Concentration) values for the crude extracts.


**Mode of Action:**
The extract's flavonoids and phenolic compounds exert anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antioxidant, hemostatic, antithrombotic, wound healing, and vasoprotective effects. Tannins provide astringent and hemostatic properties. It modulates the body’s inflammatory pathways, reducing inflammatory cytokines like IL-1 and IL-6. It also inhibits the activity of NF-κB, a protein complex that controls transcription of DNA and cytokine production.  Research suggests it may interact with or alter coagulation pathways, necessitating caution when co-administered with anticoagulants.
