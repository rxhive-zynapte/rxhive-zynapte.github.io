## **Usage**

Evening primrose oil is primarily used as a dietary supplement for various conditions, although scientific evidence supporting its efficacy is limited.  It is most commonly used for eczema, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic neuropathy, and menopausal symptoms like hot flashes.  It is also sometimes used for inducing labor, although this is not a medically recommended use.

It is categorized as a herbal supplement or a complementary medicine. More specifically, it is a source of omega-6 essential fatty acids. 

Its proposed mechanism of action is based on its gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) content. GLA is converted into prostaglandins, hormone-like substances that have anti-inflammatory effects and may play a role in various physiological processes.

## **Alternate Names**

- King's cureall
- Night willow herb
- Oenothera biennis
- Scabish
- Sun drop
- Fever plant
- Stella di sera


Some brand names include: Efamol and Blackmores.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Evening primrose oil's primary active component, GLA, is metabolized to prostaglandin E1, which possesses anti-inflammatory properties. It may also affect hormone balance and cell membrane function.  The exact mechanisms underlying its purported benefits are not fully understood.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Evening primrose oil is taken orally or applied vaginally as a suppository.  Absorption, metabolism, and elimination data in humans are limited.  GLA is metabolized in the liver and eliminated through the kidneys. Specific information on receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation is scarce.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   General health and wellbeing: 2 capsules (500mg each) per day.
*   Skin health and anti-inflammatory support:  2 capsules (500mg each) twice a day.

*   Administration: Oral capsules, typically taken with food.


#### **Children:**

Dosing for children varies by age and health conditions.  Generally, a lower dose than for adults is recommended.  Children under 12 years of age should not take it unless advised by a healthcare professional. Children aged 5-12:  1 to 3 capsules (500mg each) per day. Always consult a pediatrician before administering evening primrose oil to children.
