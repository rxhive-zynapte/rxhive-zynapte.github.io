## **Usage**

Everolimus is prescribed for various medical conditions, including:

* **Advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC):**  After treatment with sunitinib or sorafenib has failed.
* **Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis (TS):** In patients requiring therapeutic intervention but not suitable for curative surgical resection.
* **Advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer:** In postmenopausal women, in combination with exemestane, after failure of treatment with letrozole or anastrozole.
* **Progressive, well-differentiated, non-functional neuroendocrine tumors (NET):** Of gastrointestinal (GI) or lung origin that are unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic.  It is not indicated for functional carcinoid tumors.
* **Renal angiomyolipoma associated with TSC:** In adults not requiring immediate surgery.
* **TSC-associated partial-onset seizures:** As adjunctive treatment.
* **Prophylaxis of organ rejection:** In liver and kidney transplant recipients.


**Pharmacological Classification:** Everolimus is classified as a kinase inhibitor, specifically an mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor.  It also possesses immunosuppressant properties.

**Mechanism of Action:** Everolimus inhibits mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), a key regulator of cell growth, proliferation, and angiogenesis. By binding to mTORC1, everolimus disrupts cellular processes essential for tumor growth and progression. It also inhibits the proliferation of cells involved in immune responses, contributing to its immunosuppressant effects.

## **Alternate Names**

Everolimus is also known internationally by its generic name.  Brand names include Afinitor, Afinitor Disperz, Torpenz, and Zortress.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Everolimus exerts its antineoplastic effects by inhibiting mTORC1, leading to decreased cell proliferation, reduced glycolysis, and inhibition of angiogenesis. Its immunosuppressant effects result from inhibiting the proliferation and activation of T-cells and B-cells, reducing antibody production and cytokine release.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Everolimus is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak concentrations within 1 to 2 hours.  High-fat meals can decrease peak concentration (Cmax) by up to 60% and area under the curve (AUC) by about 16%.  Bioavailability is approximately 30%.
* **Metabolism:** Everolimus is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 in the liver.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through biliary/fecal excretion as metabolites, with a small percentage excreted in urine. The terminal half-life is approximately 30 hours.

**Mode of Action:**  Everolimus binds to the intracellular protein FKBP-12, forming a complex that inhibits mTORC1.  This inhibition disrupts downstream signaling pathways involved in cell growth, proliferation, and angiogenesis.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Everolimus binds to FKBP-12 and inhibits the mTORC1 kinase.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Mainly biliary/fecal excretion; less than 5% excreted unchanged in urine.  Metabolized by CYP3A4.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard dose for most indications is 10 mg orally once daily.

#### **Children:**

Dosing is based on body surface area (BSA) for some indications, such as SEGA associated with TSC (4.5 mg/m² orally once daily) and partial-onset seizures (5 mg/m² orally once daily).  For other indications, the dose must be determined by the physician.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dose adjustment is required, but careful monitoring for adverse events is recommended.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is generally necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments are required. For Child-Pugh class B, reduce the dose to 5 mg daily.  For Child-Pugh class C, everolimus is not recommended unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks, and if used, the dose should not exceed 2.5 mg daily.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Dose adjustments may be needed based on specific comorbid conditions and concomitant medications.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Everolimus is not indicated for the clinical use cases you mentioned (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest).  It is primarily used for the treatment of specific cancers and tumors, as well as for immunosuppression in transplant patients.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are required for hepatic impairment and when co-administered with CYP3A4 and/or P-gp inhibitors or inducers.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Stomatitis, infection, rash, fatigue, diarrhea, peripheral edema, anemia, nausea, hyperlipidemia, headache, abdominal pain, fever, cough, constipation, hypertension, urinary tract infection, leukopenia, decreased appetite.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Pneumonitis, angioedema, pancreatitis, hypertensive crisis, bleeding events, congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, hepatic artery thrombosis (in liver transplant patients), renal impairment.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, renal dysfunction, infections, secondary malignancies (rare).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Anaphylaxis, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (rare), interstitial lung disease.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to everolimus, other rapamycin derivatives, or any component of the formulation.  Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or pulmonary fibrosis.

## **Drug Interactions**

Everolimus interacts with numerous medications, including:

* **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:**  Increase everolimus levels.
* **CYP3A4 Inducers:** Decrease everolimus levels.
* **P-gp Inhibitors:** Increase everolimus levels.
* **P-gp Inducers:** Decrease everolimus levels.
* **Immunosuppressants:** Increase risk of infection.
* **Live vaccines:** Should be avoided.

Examples:  azole antifungals (ketoconazole, itraconazole), antibiotics (clarithromycin), anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin), St. John's wort, grapefruit juice.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy Safety Category:** Everolimus is not recommended during pregnancy due to potential fetal harm.  Adequate contraception should be used during treatment and for 8 weeks after the last dose.

**Fetal Risks:** Embryo-fetal toxicity, including increased resorptions, reduced fetal weight, and malformations.

**Breastfeeding:** Everolimus is not recommended during breastfeeding.  It is excreted in animal milk and may pose a risk to nursing infants.  Breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose.
