      How does Evogliptin work?**


      **A:** It inhibits DPP-4, increasing incretin hormone levels, which in
      turn enhances insulin release and suppresses glucagon.

## **Usage**

- Evogliptin is prescribed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control. It can be used as monotherapy or in combination with metformin.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, Antidiabetic agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Evogliptin works by inhibiting the DPP-4 enzyme, which is responsible for breaking down incretin hormones like GLP-1 and GIP. These hormones play a crucial role in regulating blood glucose levels by stimulating insulin release and suppressing glucagon secretion. By inhibiting DPP-4, Evogliptin increases the levels of active incretin hormones, leading to improved glycemic control.

## **Alternate Names**

- Evogliptin Tartrate.
- **Brand Names:** Valera, Evodin, Suganon, Gojeku.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Evogliptin selectively inhibits DPP-4, leading to increased levels of active GLP-1 and GIP. This results in enhanced glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppressed glucagon release, and ultimately, reduced blood glucose levels.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - **Absorption:**  Administered orally, Evogliptin reaches peak plasma concentrations within a few hours. Food intake does not significantly affect its absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by CYP3A4.
    - **Elimination:** Approximately 46.1% is excreted in urine and 42.8% in feces, including both the unchanged drug and its metabolites.
- **Mode of Action:** Evogliptin binds to and inhibits the DPP-4 enzyme, preventing the degradation of incretin hormones.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**  Inhibits DPP-4 enzyme activity, with an IC50 of 0.980 nM and a Ki of 0.525 nM. Does not significantly interact with DPP-8 and DPP-9.  Not an inhibitor of or inducer of major CYP enzymes. It is a P-gp substrate and a weak BCRP substrate, but it doesn't inhibit these transporters. It doesn't interact with OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Renal and hepatic excretion.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 5 mg orally once daily, with or without food.
- Maximum daily dose: 5 mg.

#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients have not been established.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Administer with caution due to potential decreased hepatic and renal function. Monitor patient condition closely.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Administer cautiously, as increased blood concentrations of Evogliptin may occur in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment is not needed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with heart failure (NYHA Class I), a history of pancreatitis, and other relevant conditions.  Dosage adjustments might be needed.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- The provided sources do not offer specific dosage recommendations for Evogliptin in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its primary indication is for chronic management of type 2 diabetes.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with renal/hepatic impairment and in those taking concomitant medications that interact with Evogliptin, such as CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin) or inducers (e.g., rifampicin).



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions (e.g., angioedema)
- Hypoglycemia (especially when combined with other antidiabetic medications)
- Lactic Acidosis (with metformin combination)


### **Long-Term Effects:**

-  Long-term effects of Evogliptin are still under investigation.  Monitoring for potential complications like pancreatitis and renal function changes is important.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP3A4 Inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin):** May increase Evogliptin exposure.
- **CYP3A4 Inducers (e.g., rifampicin):** May decrease Evogliptin exposure.
- **Other Antidiabetic Medications (e.g., sulfonylureas, insulin):** Increased risk of hypoglycemia.
- **Metformin:** No clinically significant interaction.
- **Alcohol:** Potential interaction is unknown.  Alcohol may worsen side effects such as lactic acidosis (especially when combined with metformin) and hypoglycemia.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Not established. Use is not recommended due to potential fetal risks. Animal studies show placental transfer.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Use is not recommended, as Evogliptin may be excreted in breast milk. Animal studies confirm secretion in milk.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** DPP-4 inhibitor, increasing incretin hormone levels.
- **Side Effects:** Indigestion, diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, gastritis, joint pain, headache, pancreatitis (rare), hypoglycemia (with other antidiabetics).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, type 1 diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis, pregnancy, breastfeeding, NYHA Class II-IV heart failure.
- **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers, other antidiabetics.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Not recommended.
- **Dosage:** 5 mg orally once daily.
