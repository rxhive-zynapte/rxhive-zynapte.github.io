## **Usage**

Evolocumab is prescribed to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels ("bad" cholesterol) and thereby decrease the risk of cardiovascular events like heart attack and stroke. It's specifically indicated for:

* **Primary Hyperlipidemia (including Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH))**:  As an adjunct to diet, alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe), to lower LDL-C.
* **Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH)**: As an adjunct to diet and other LDL-lowering therapies  (e.g., statins, ezetimibe, LDL apheresis) when additional LDL-C lowering is required.
* **Established Cardiovascular Disease**: To reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization in adults.

**Pharmacological Classification**:  Evolocumab is a PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor.

**Mechanism of Action**: Evolocumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to PCSK9 and inhibits its interaction with the LDL receptor. This inhibition prevents PCSK9 from degrading LDL receptors, increasing the number of LDL receptors available on liver cells to clear LDL-C from the blood, resulting in lower LDL-C levels.


## **Alternate Names**

**International Nonproprietary Name (INN)**: Evolocumab

**Brand Name**: Repatha


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics**: Evolocumab significantly lowers LDL-C levels by increasing the number of LDL receptors available to clear LDL-C from circulation. This reduces the risk of cardiovascular events.

**Pharmacokinetics**:

* **Absorption**: Evolocumab is administered subcutaneously and is absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of 72%.  Maximum plasma concentration is reached in 3 to 4 days.
* **Metabolism**: As a monoclonal antibody, evolocumab is primarily catabolized like endogenous IgG antibodies, through intracellular catabolism to small peptides and amino acids, rather than by specific metabolic pathways.
* **Elimination**: Evolocumab has a half-life of 11 to 17 days.  It is eliminated via non-renal routes, primarily catabolism into amino acids and peptides which are subsequently re-utilized. 

**Mode of Action**:  Evolocumab acts by binding to circulating PCSK9.  PCSK9 typically binds to LDL receptors, which leads to their degradation. By preventing PCSK9 from binding to LDL receptors, evolocumab increases the recycling of LDL receptors to the hepatocyte cell surface, resulting in increased LDL-C uptake and clearance from circulation.


**Receptor Binding**: Binds to PCSK9, preventing PCSK9 from binding to and degrading LDL receptors.

**Enzyme Inhibition**: Inhibits the activity of PCSK9.

**Elimination Pathways**: Primarily non-renal, by intracellular catabolism like endogenous IgGs.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults**:
* **Primary Hyperlipidemia/Established Cardiovascular Disease**: 140 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks *or* 420 mg subcutaneously once monthly. Both doses are clinically equivalent.
* **Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia**: Initial dose of 420 mg subcutaneously once monthly. May be increased to 420 mg every 2 weeks if LDL-C reduction is inadequate after 12 weeks. Patients undergoing LDL apheresis may start with 420 mg every 2 weeks to coordinate with their apheresis schedule; administer evolocumab after completing an apheresis session.

#### **Children**:
* **Primary Hyperlipidemia/Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (10 years and older)**: Same dosage as adults.
* **Children younger than 10 years**: Safety and efficacy have not been established.  Use and dose must be determined by a doctor.

#### **Special Cases**:
* **Elderly Patients**: No dose adjustment is necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment**: No dose adjustment is necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**:  No dose adjustment necessary for mild or moderate impairment.  Evolocumab should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment, with close monitoring, as reduced exposure has been observed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**:  Dosage adjustments are generally not recommended for specific comorbidities. However, careful monitoring is advised, especially in patients with diabetes, as evolocumab may slightly increase blood glucose levels.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Evolocumab's dosing does not change for clinical use cases such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  The standard dosing guidelines based on the indication should be followed.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are generally not necessary based on age, gender, race, or body weight.  However, monitoring of LDL-C levels is recommended to assess treatment response and adjust dosage frequency for HoFH patients if necessary.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**:
* Nasopharyngitis
* Upper respiratory tract infection
* Back pain
* Arthralgia
* Influenza
* Nausea
* Injection site reactions (pain, redness, bruising, swelling)
* Hyperglycemia

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**:
* Allergic reactions, including angioedema, urticaria, and hypersensitivity


### **Long-Term Effects**:
Limited data are available on truly long-term side effects beyond several years. However, ongoing monitoring for potential adverse events is recommended.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**:
Serious hypersensitivity reactions, requiring immediate discontinuation of treatment and supportive care.


## **Contraindications**

* History of serious hypersensitivity reaction to evolocumab or any of its excipients.


## **Drug Interactions**

No clinically significant drug interactions have been identified.  Evolocumab is not metabolized by CYP450 enzymes, reducing the likelihood of metabolic drug interactions.  Concomitant use with statins is common and often recommended.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy**:  Limited data are available.  Evolocumab should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  Monoclonal antibodies are less likely to cross the placenta in the first trimester but can cross in increasing amounts in the second and third trimesters. A pregnancy exposure registry exists to monitor outcomes. 
* **Breastfeeding**: It is unknown whether evolocumab is present in human milk.  Because it is a large protein molecule,  the amount in milk is likely to be low. Due to the potential for minimal absorption in the infant's gastrointestinal tract, the risk is thought to be minimal. However, use with caution, especially in nursing newborns or premature infants.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action**: Inhibits PCSK9 binding to LDL receptors, increasing LDL receptor recycling and LDL-C clearance.
* **Side Effects**: Nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections, back pain, injection site reactions, hyperglycemia. Rare but serious hypersensitivity reactions possible.
* **Contraindications**:  Serious hypersensitivity to evolocumab or any of its components.
* **Drug Interactions**: No clinically significant drug interactions.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding**: Limited data. Use with caution during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk.  Minimal risk anticipated during breastfeeding but use with caution.
* **Dosage**: Adults/Children ≥10 years: 140 mg SC q2weeks *or* 420 mg SC monthly (Primary Hyperlipidemia/Established Cardiovascular Disease);  420 mg SC monthly (HoFH, initial dose). Adjustments may be needed for HoFH.
* **Monitoring Parameters**:  LDL-C levels, blood glucose, signs of hypersensitivity reactions.

## **Popular Combinations**

Evolocumab is commonly combined with statins (e.g., atorvastatin, rosuvastatin) and/or ezetimibe for synergistic LDL-C lowering effects in patients with primary hyperlipidemia or established cardiovascular disease.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions**: Evaluate for pre-existing hypersensitivity reactions, moderate/severe hepatic impairment.  Exclude secondary causes of hyperlipidemia before initiating therapy.
* **Specific Populations**:  See Pregnancy and Breastfeeding section above.
* **Lifestyle Considerations**: Counsel patients on maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle alongside evolocumab therapy for optimal cardiovascular risk reduction.  No driving or operating machinery restrictions are associated with evolocumab.
