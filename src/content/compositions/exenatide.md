## **Usage**

- Exenatide is prescribed as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It is used in combination with other oral antidiabetic medications like metformin, sulfonylureas, or thiazolidinediones when these alone do not provide adequate glycemic control. It can also be used with basal insulin (e.g., insulin glargine).
- **Pharmacological classification:** Incretin mimetic; Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Exenatide mimics the effects of GLP-1, a naturally occurring hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels.  It stimulates insulin release in a glucose-dependent manner, suppresses glucagon secretion, slows gastric emptying, and reduces appetite.

## **Alternate Names**

- No alternate generic names.
- **Brand Names:** Byetta (immediate-release), Bydureon (extended-release), Bydureon BCise (extended-release).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Exenatide enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppresses inappropriately elevated glucagon secretion, slows gastric emptying, and reduces appetite.  These actions contribute to improved glycemic control.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Subcutaneous administration; extended-release formulation provides sustained drug levels.
    - **Metabolism:**  Primarily degraded by proteolytic enzymes (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 plays a minor role).
    - **Elimination:** Renal excretion of metabolites.
- **Mode of Action:** Binds to and activates GLP-1 receptors in pancreatic beta cells, leading to increased insulin release when blood glucose levels are elevated.  It also acts on alpha cells to suppress glucagon secretion.  The effects on gastric emptying and appetite are mediated through the central nervous system.
- **Receptor Binding:** GLP-1 receptor agonist.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Immediate-release (Byetta):** 5 mcg subcutaneously twice daily, within 60 minutes before the morning and evening meals. After one month, the dose may be increased to 10 mcg twice daily if needed.
- **Extended-release (Bydureon, Bydureon BCise):** 2 mg subcutaneously once weekly, any time of day, with or without meals.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for use in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients (over 70 years):** Initiate with caution; dose escalation should proceed conservatively. Limited experience in patients over 75 years.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    - Mild (CrCl 50-80 mL/min): No dosage adjustment required.
    - Moderate (CrCl 30-50 mL/min): Initiate and escalate dose with caution.
    - Severe (CrCl < 30 mL/min) or ESRD: Not recommended.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate patient's overall condition and adjust other diabetes medications as needed.  Caution should be used in patients with a history of pancreatitis.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Exenatide is not indicated for use in these specific clinical settings:

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations** (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest)

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are primarily based on renal function (as outlined above).  No adjustments are necessary for hepatic dysfunction.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, headache, dizziness, dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, injection site reactions.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Pancreatitis (acute or chronic), renal impairment (including acute renal failure),  anaphylaxis/angioedema, gallbladder disease, hypoglycemia (when combined with other antidiabetic agents).

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Potential for increased risk of medullary thyroid carcinoma based on animal studies (data in humans are inconclusive).
- Chronic kidney disease progression in patients with pre-existing renal impairment.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe hypoglycemia, acute pancreatitis, hypersensitivity reactions.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to exenatide or any component of the formulation.
- History of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2).
- Severe gastroparesis or other conditions that significantly delay gastric emptying (especially with extended-release formulation).
- End-stage renal disease or severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 ml/min).


## **Drug Interactions**

- Delayed gastric emptying can alter the absorption of orally administered medications, particularly those requiring rapid absorption.
- Monitor for hypoglycemia when used with sulfonylureas or insulin.
- Caution should be exercised when using with warfarin.
- No clinically significant CYP450 interactions.
- No known interactions with food or lifestyle factors.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Category C (Animal studies have shown adverse effects on the fetus; potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks.)
- **Fetal Risks:**  Potential for developmental toxicity.
- **Breastfeeding:** Unknown if excreted in human milk. Advise caution or discontinue breastfeeding if using exenatide.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** GLP-1 receptor agonist; stimulates glucose-dependent insulin release, suppresses glucagon, slows gastric emptying, reduces appetite.

- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, MTC/MEN 2, severe gastroparesis, severe renal impairment.
- **Drug Interactions:**  Delayed gastric emptying can affect absorption of oral drugs.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Caution advised during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
