## **Usage**

Extractum Cepae-Cepalin, in combination with heparin and allantoin, is a topical dermatological agent primarily used for the management of scars.  These scars can result from surgery, burns, stretch marks, acne, and breast amputations. It is also used for the treatment of burns, hypertrophic and keloidal scars, contractures (e.g., Dupuytren's contracture, traumatic tendon contracture), and cicatricial strictures. It acts as an anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and counter-irritant.

## **Alternate Names**

This combination product is marketed under various brand names including Thromboscar Gel, Scanil Gel, Contractubex, and Scarlite Gel.

## **How It Works**

* **Pharmacodynamics:**
    * **Extractum Cepae-Cepalin:** Inhibits Prostaglandin F2-alpha (PGF2-alpha), reducing inflammation and scar tissue formation.
    * **Heparin:** Acts as an anti-inflammatory, improves blood flow to the affected area, promotes healing, and aids in moisture retention within the scar tissue.
    * **Allantoin:** Keratolytic agent that removes dead skin cells, softens the skin, and promotes wound healing.

* **Pharmacokinetics:** Topical application minimizes systemic absorption.  Specific information on absorption, metabolism, and elimination pathways for this combination product is limited.

* **Mode of Action:**  The combined action of these three components contributes to the overall effect of reducing inflammation, promoting healing, and improving scar appearance.

* **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Extractum Cepae-Cepalin primarily inhibits PGF2-alpha. The mechanism of action for heparin and allantoin in scar reduction are less specific but contribute to anti-inflammatory and wound healing processes.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer to the clean and dry affected area 1-2 times daily or as directed by the physician. Gently massage until absorbed.

#### **Children:** Use in children under 1 year of age is not recommended. For children over 1 year, consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosage and application guidelines.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are typically necessary. However, consider skin fragility and potential for irritation.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustments are necessary for topical application as systemic absorption is minimal.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific dose adjustments are necessary for topical application as systemic absorption is minimal.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** While no specific adjustments are mentioned, caution is advised for patients with bleeding disorders or those taking anticoagulants. Consult a physician for personalized advice.
