## **Usage**

Ezetimibe is prescribed to lower high cholesterol levels. It's used as adjunctive therapy to diet for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and triglycerides (TG), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).  It is specifically indicated for:

* **Primary Hypercholesterolemia (Heterozygous Familial and Non-Familial):** In adults and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age).
* **Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH):** In adults and adolescents (10 to 17 years of age), usually administered with a statin.
* **Homozygous Sitosterolemia:** To reduce elevated sitosterol and campesterol levels.

Ezetimibe's pharmacological classification is a **cholesterol absorption inhibitor**.  It works by selectively inhibiting the intestinal absorption of cholesterol and related plant sterols.

## **Alternate Names**

Ezetimibe is the generic name. Brand names include **Zetia** and **Ezetrol**.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ezetimibe primarily acts on the small intestine's brush border, where it inhibits the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein.  NPC1L1 is a transporter responsible for cholesterol absorption. By inhibiting this transporter, ezetimibe reduces the amount of cholesterol absorbed from the diet, thereby lowering plasma cholesterol levels.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Ezetimibe is absorbed after oral administration and is extensively metabolized in the small intestine and liver to its pharmacologically active glucuronide metabolite (ezetimibe-glucuronide).
* **Metabolism:** Ezetimibe undergoes enterohepatic recirculation, which contributes to its long half-life.
* **Elimination:** Both ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide are primarily eliminated in the feces (approximately 80%), with a smaller portion excreted in the urine (approximately 10%).

**Mode of Action:** Ezetimibe targets the NPC1L1 transporter at the brush border of enterocytes.  This inhibition effectively blocks the uptake of cholesterol and plant sterols from the intestinal lumen.  

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Ezetimibe does not bind to receptors or modulate neurotransmitters.  Its primary mechanism is selective inhibition of the NPC1L1 transporter protein.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
The standard dosage for adults is 10 mg orally once daily, taken with or without food.

#### **Children (10 years and older):**
The standard dosage for children 10 years and older is 10 mg orally once daily, taken with or without food.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction (Mild):** No dosage adjustment is required.  Ezetimibe is not recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments may be required depending on the specific comorbidity.  Refer to a specialist for guidance.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Ezetimibe is not typically used in acute clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  It's primarily indicated for chronic management of hypercholesterolemia.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Upper respiratory tract infections, diarrhea, joint pain, muscle pain, and fatigue.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Liver problems (abdominal pain, yellowing of skin and eyes), myopathy/rhabdomyolysis (unexplained muscle pain, weakness), hypersensitivity reactions (angioedema, anaphylaxis), pancreatitis, and severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SJS, TEN, DRESS).


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to ezetimibe.
* Active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations in serum transaminases (especially when used in combination with a statin).
* Pregnancy and lactation when used in combination with a statin.
* Moderate or severe hepatic impairment.
* Concurrent use with a statin, fenofibrate, or other LDL-C lowering therapy when such therapy is contraindicated.



## **Drug Interactions**

* **Cyclosporine:** Increased exposure of ezetimibe and cyclosporine.
* **Fibrates (other than fenofibrate):** Increased risk of gallstones.
* **Bile acid sequestrants:** Administer ezetimibe at least 2 hours before or 4 hours after bile acid sequestrants.
* **Statins:** Increased risk of myopathy.
* **Anticoagulants (e.g., Warfarin):** Close monitoring is required.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Ezetimibe is generally avoided during pregnancy, especially when combined with a statin. If absolutely necessary, use only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:** While limited data exists, ezetimibe is generally considered acceptable during breastfeeding.  However, using Ezetimibe in combination with a statin is not recommended.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption.
* **Side Effects:**  Common: Upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, joint pain, and fatigue. Serious: Liver damage, myopathy, hypersensitivity reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, active liver disease, pregnancy/lactation with statins, moderate/severe hepatic impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Cyclosporine, fibrates, bile acid sequestrants, statins.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Avoid during pregnancy (especially with statins).  Generally acceptable during breastfeeding (avoid with statins).
* **Dosage:** 10 mg once daily, with or without food.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides), liver function tests.

## **Popular Combinations**

* **Ezetimibe + Statin:** This combination is frequently used to achieve greater LDL-C reduction than either drug alone.


## **Precautions**

* Monitor liver function tests.
* Monitor for muscle pain or weakness (especially with statins).
* Evaluate for gallbladder disease (especially with fibrates).
