## **Usage**

Faropenem is a broad-spectrum antibiotic belonging to the penem class. It is prescribed for various bacterial infections, including:

* Upper and lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., pneumonia, bronchitis)
* Ear, nose, and throat (ENT) infections (e.g., otitis media, sinusitis)
* Genitourinary infections (e.g., urinary tract infections)
* Skin and skin structure infections (e.g., cellulitis, impetigo)
* Gynecological infections

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic (Penem)

**Mechanism of Action:**  Faropenem inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to and inactivating penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).  PBPs are essential for the final step of peptidoglycan synthesis, a crucial component of the bacterial cell wall. By disrupting this process, Faropenem weakens the cell wall, leading to bacterial cell lysis and death. It exhibits bactericidal activity against a wide range of gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria.


## **Alternate Names**

Faropenem sodium (the sodium salt form)

**Brand Names:**  Examples include Farobact, Farotreat, Faronem ER (Note: Brand names can vary regionally).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Faropenem exerts its bactericidal effect by disrupting bacterial cell wall synthesis, as described above.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Faropenem is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1-1.5 hours after administration.  Absorption is moderately affected by food.
* **Metabolism:** Minimally metabolized.
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine via renal mechanisms.  The half-life of Faropenem is prolonged in elderly patients and those with renal impairment.

**Mode of Action:**  Faropenem's mode of action involves binding to PBPs, specifically PBP-2 and PBP-3, which are involved in peptidoglycan cross-linking and transpeptidation reactions.  This leads to cell wall instability and bacterial death.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**  Faropenem acts as a PBP inhibitor.  It does not typically modulate neurotransmitters.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily eliminated through renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard dose is typically 200 mg three times daily (t.i.d.) or 300 mg twice daily, depending on the infection's severity and the specific formulation (immediate-release or extended-release). The maximum dose is usually up to 600mg daily, although higher dosages might be required in severe cases.  Always refer to product information for country-specific recommendations. 

#### **Children:**

Safety and efficacy in children under 18 years have not been fully established for all formulations. Some sources propose 15 mg/kg/day divided into three doses or a maximum of 30 mg/kg given 3-4 times a day.  For children with disseminated tuberculosis, one source suggests an optimal dosage of 30 mg/kg 3â€“4 times daily. Faropenem dry syrup formulations are available in some regions. Pediatric dosing should be carefully considered based on the specific product information and clinical context. Consult local pediatric prescribing guidelines for the most up-to-date recommendations.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose (e.g., 150 mg) and monitor for adverse effects.  Dose adjustments may be necessary due to age-related decline in renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction or increased dosing intervals may be required depending on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are usually necessary as Faropenem is minimally metabolized by the liver. However, caution is advised.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics, including penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems.  Patients with a family history of atopy (allergic conditions) should also be closely monitored.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing recommendations for specific clinical situations are not consistently provided in the sources, therefore, adhering to standard dosing guidelines and adjusting based on the severity of infection, the specific product formulation, and individual patient characteristics is essential. Consultation with an infectious disease specialist is recommended for complex cases involving intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) use, and other emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be required based on renal function, age, and individual patient response.  Therapeutic drug monitoring may be beneficial in some cases.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Rash
* Headache


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* *Clostridium difficile* - associated diarrhea (pseudomembranous colitis)
* Hematologic abnormalities (e.g., anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia)
* Vitamin K deficiency


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Potential long-term effects are not well-documented but may include vitamin K or vitamin B deficiency, especially in elderly patients or those with poor nutritional intake.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
Clinically significant ADRs include severe allergic reactions, *C. difficile* infection, and significant hematological abnormalities. These require immediate medical intervention, including stopping the drug and providing supportive care.


## **Contraindications**

* Known hypersensitivity to Faropenem or other beta-lactam antibiotics.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Imipenem/Cilastatin:** Concurrent use may increase Faropenem plasma concentrations.
* **Furosemide:** May increase the risk of Faropenem-related nephrotoxicity.
* **Sodium Valproate:**  Faropenem may decrease valproic acid levels, potentially leading to a recurrence of seizures in patients with epilepsy.
* **Probenecid:** Faropenem might reduce the effectiveness of Probenecid.
* **Anticoagulants:** Potential increased risk of bleeding.
* **Oral contraceptives:** Faropenem may decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives.
* **Methotrexate:** Combined use may increase the risk of Methotrexate-related side effects.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of Faropenem during pregnancy has not been definitively established. It should be used only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Faropenem is excreted in breast milk.  Caution is advised during breastfeeding. Consider the benefits of breastfeeding, the risk of potential infant drug exposure, and the need for treatment.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to PBPs.
