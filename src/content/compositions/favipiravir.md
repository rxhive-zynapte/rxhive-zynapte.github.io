## **Usage**

- Favipiravir is an antiviral medication primarily used for the treatment of influenza in Japan.  It is indicated for novel influenza strains (those causing more severe disease) that are unresponsive to standard antiviral therapies. It has also been investigated for its potential use against other viral infections, including COVID-19.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Antiviral agent, specifically a pyrazinecarboxamide derivative.
- **Mechanism of action:** Favipiravir is a prodrug that is metabolized to its active form, favipiravir-ribofuranosyl-5'-triphosphate (favipiravir-RTP). Favipiravir-RTP acts as a selective inhibitor of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the enzyme responsible for viral RNA replication. By inhibiting RdRp, Favipiravir prevents viral replication within infected cells.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:** T-705
- **Brand Names:** Avigan, Favikast, Favicovid, Fabihenz, Favtris, Favibest.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Favipiravir's primary effect is the inhibition of viral RNA replication.  It achieves this through the selective inhibition of viral RdRp. It mimics both guanosine and adenosine, interfering with viral primer extension.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Favipiravir is administered orally and is rapidly and almost completely absorbed (bioavailability approximately 97.6%). It is metabolized to its active form, favipiravir-RTP, intracellularly. It is primarily cleared renally, with an elimination half-life of 2 to 5.5 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Favipiravir-RTP acts as a purine nucleoside analogue. It inhibits viral RdRp. It mimics both guanosine and adenosine for the viral RdRp, leading to the prevention of RNA strand elongation and halting viral proliferation.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion. Minimal hepatic metabolism via aldehyde oxidase and uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), not CYP enzymes.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The recommended dosage for influenza is 1600 mg twice daily on Day 1, followed by 600 mg twice daily on Days 2-5.
- For COVID-19, dosage regimens vary and may involve higher doses and longer durations (up to 14 days), typically 1800 mg twice on day one, then 800 mg twice daily.
- Administration is oral, preferably on an empty stomach. However, it may be taken with food to reduce gastrointestinal side effects.

#### **Children:**

- Use in children is not recommended due to limited safety and efficacy data.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Careful administration is advised. Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be needed based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Increase in plasma levels has been reported. Careful monitoring and possible dosage adjustment are recommended.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with gout, hyperuricemia, or other metabolic disorders. For patients with diabetes or taking anticoagulants such as warfarin, interactions must be considered.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Favipiravir is not typically used in clinical settings involving intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use. Emergency use is primarily for influenza pandemics or severe viral infections when other options are unavailable. For COVID-19 use is limited to mild to moderate cases.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be required for patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, gout, or other metabolic disorders. Consider drug interactions, especially with pyrazinamide, repaglinide, theophylline, famciclovir, acyclovir, and sulindac.
