      How does Fenbendazole work?**


      **A:** Fenbendazole interferes with the parasite's ability to absorb
      nutrients, leading to its death.  It works by binding to tubulin, a
      protein essential for the formation of microtubules within the parasite's
      cells.

## **Usage**

Fenbendazole is a broad-spectrum anthelmintic (antiparasitic) medication primarily used to treat and control various internal parasites in animals. While not FDA-approved for human use, it is sometimes prescribed off-label by veterinarians for certain parasitic infections in companion animals. It is effective against several gastrointestinal parasites, including:

*   Roundworms ( *Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina*)
*   Hookworms (*Ancylostoma caninum, Uncinaria stenocephala*)
*   Whipworms (*Trichuris vulpis*)
*   Certain Tapeworms (*Taenia pisiformis*)
*   Giardia (*Giardia intestinalis*, a protozoan parasite)
*   Lungworms
*   Some Flukes



## **Alternate Names**

*   Panacur®
*   Safe-Guard®



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Fenbendazole disrupts the parasite's metabolism by binding to tubulin, a protein essential for cell structure and function, including nutrient absorption. This binding inhibits the formation of microtubules, leading to energy depletion and ultimately the parasite's death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Fenbendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, which is advantageous for treating intestinal parasites. Absorption is increased when administered with food.
*   **Metabolism:** Fenbendazole is primarily metabolized in the liver to its sulfoxide metabolite, oxfendazole (also an active anthelmintic).
*   **Elimination:** Fenbendazole and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the feces, with a small amount eliminated in urine.


## **Dosage**

Fenbendazole dosing is typically based on body weight and the specific parasite being treated. The duration of treatment varies depending on the parasite and may range from a single dose to several consecutive days.

### **Standard Dosage**  

**Note:** The following information pertains primarily to veterinary use in animals. Human dosing should only be under the strict guidance of a medical professional and may vary considerably.  Always consult with a veterinarian for appropriate animal dosing.

#### **Adults (Animals):**

*   For most gastrointestinal parasites: 50 mg/kg body weight per day, orally, for 3 consecutive days.

#### **Children (Animals):**

*   Puppies and kittens under 6 months: 50 mg/kg body weight per day, orally, for 3 consecutive days.


#### **Special Cases (Animals):**
* **Pregnant animals:** Fenbendazole is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy, especially for preventing transplacental and transmammary transmission of parasites. Specific protocols exist for deworming pregnant dogs and other animals; consult a veterinarian for guidance.
* **Other species:** Dosing may differ for other animal species; consult a veterinarian for species-specific recommendations.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  

The provided sources do not contain sufficient information about the clinical use cases for Fenbendazole in humans in settings such as Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, or Emergency Situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**  

Dosages may need adjustments based on the animal's specific health condition, age, and concurrent medications. Always follow the veterinarian's recommendations for dosing adjustments.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects (Animals):**

*   Mild gastrointestinal upset (vomiting, diarrhea)
*   Increased salivation (drooling)


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects (Animals):**

*   Allergic reactions (facial swelling, hives, difficulty breathing)
*   Bone marrow suppression (rare, more common in birds)




## **Contraindications (Animals):**

*   Hypersensitivity to fenbendazole or any of its components
*   Use with caution in sick or debilitated animals



## **Drug Interactions (Animals):**

No significant drug interactions are known in animals, but inform your veterinarian of all medications your patient is taking.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding (Animals):**

Fenbendazole is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy, particularly in the later stages, to prevent transmission of parasites to offspring. It's also considered safe during lactation. However, always consult a veterinarian before administering any medication to pregnant or lactating animals.



## **Drug Profile Summary (Animals):**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** Binds to tubulin, disrupting parasite metabolism and leading to death.
*   **Side Effects:** Generally mild; may include gastrointestinal upset.
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity.
*   **Drug Interactions:** No significant interactions known.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe, consult a veterinarian.
*   **Dosage:** Varies by species and parasite; commonly 50 mg/kg/day for 3 days.
*   **Monitoring Parameters:** Fecal examinations to assess treatment efficacy.



## **Popular Combinations**

The sources do not provide information regarding popular drug combinations with fenbendazole. 



## **Precautions (Animals):**

*   Accurate weighing is crucial for correct dosing.
*   Administer with food to enhance absorption.
*   Monitor for adverse reactions, especially in pregnant animals.
