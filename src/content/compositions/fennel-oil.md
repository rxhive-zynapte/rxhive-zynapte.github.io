## **Usage**

Fennel oil is primarily used for digestive issues like bloating, gas, and indigestion. It is also used to alleviate cough and respiratory ailments, menstrual discomfort, and as an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial support.  Its pharmacological classifications include carminative, antispasmodic, expectorant, and galactagogue.  Fennel oil's mechanism of action involves relaxing intestinal smooth muscles to relieve gas and bloating.  It also possesses mild estrogenic effects.

## **Alternate Names**

Fennel oil is also known as *Aneth Doux*, *Bitterfenchel*, *Fenchel*, and *Foeniculum Vulgare*. Some examples of brand names include Flatuna, ColiMil, and Smooth Move (note that these may contain other ingredients in addition to fennel).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Fennel oil exerts antispasmodic and carminative effects on the gastrointestinal tract, reducing spasms and promoting the expulsion of gas. It also has expectorant properties, helping to clear mucus from the respiratory tract. Its mild estrogenic activity may influence hormonal balance and impact conditions like menstrual discomfort.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Limited data exists on the specific pharmacokinetics of fennel oil. It's assumed to be absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract when ingested and through the skin when applied topically. Metabolism and elimination pathways are not well-defined, but it's likely metabolized in the liver and excreted through the kidneys.  Specific receptor binding or enzyme inhibition are not well-characterized.

## **Dosage**

Dosage varies depending on the form and concentration of fennel oil.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Oil:** 0.1–0.6 mL (equivalent to approximately 2-12 drops) up to three times daily for no more than two weeks. Some sources suggest a maximum oral dose of 54 mg for adults.  It should be diluted in a carrier oil (such as coconut, olive, or jojoba) for oral use or topical application. For topical application, a dermal maximum of 2.5% dilution is recommended. 
- **Tea:** 1–2 g of crushed fennel seeds steeped in 150 mL boiling water.  May be consumed several times daily.
- **Tincture:** 5–7.5 g per day orally.
- **Capsules:** 1–2 capsules (480–960 mg) up to three times daily, preferably with food.

#### **Children:**

Fennel's safety and efficacy in children for medicinal purposes haven't been thoroughly established, except for its limited use in infantile colic.
- **Infants (Colic Relief):** Specific products like ColiMil (containing fennel, lemon balm, and German chamomile) have been studied for reducing colic symptoms. Dosages should follow product-specific instructions and should not be used for children under 12 years of age without medical advice.
- Use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age is generally contraindicated for medicinal purposes.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be needed based on individual health status and organ function. Consult a geriatric specialist for guidance.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Careful consideration of renal function is warranted. Dose adjustments may be necessary.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Monitor liver function, and adjust dosage as needed.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Individualized assessment and dose adjustments based on specific comorbidities are necessary. For those with hormone-sensitive conditions, fennel oil is contraindicated due to its estrogenic properties.



### **Clinical Use Cases**  

Fennel oil is generally not indicated for use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its use is primarily limited to at-home management of mild digestive or respiratory symptoms.



### **Dosage Adjustments**  

Dose modifications are necessary based on patient-specific factors such as renal or hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, and potential drug interactions.  Genetic polymorphisms impacting drug metabolism may also necessitate dose adjustments, but these are not well defined.

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Skin irritation or allergic reactions (topical application)
- Gastrointestinal upset (large doses)


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Seizures
- Breathing difficulties, tightness of chest/throat
- Chest pain


### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic complications from prolonged use are not well-documented. However, due to potential hormonal effects, long-term use without medical supervision is not recommended.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

ADRs include seizures and severe allergic reactions. These necessitate immediate medical intervention.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to fennel, carrots, celery, or mugwort
- Pregnancy
- Breastfeeding
- Hormone-sensitive conditions (e.g., breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, uterine fibroids)
- Concomitant use of antibiotics or medications metabolized by CYP3A4 enzymes
- Epilepsy or seizure disorders

## **Drug Interactions**

- Medications metabolized by CYP3A4 (fennel may inhibit this enzyme)
- Medications that slow blood clotting (increased risk of bleeding)
- Birth control pills and hormone replacement therapy (may interfere with efficacy)
- Ciprofloxacin
- Tamoxifen



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Fennel oil is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  It is possibly unsafe during pregnancy and has been linked to preterm birth.  There are reports of neurological damage in breastfed infants exposed to fennel through breast milk.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Relaxes smooth muscles, carminative, expectorant, mild estrogenic effects.
- **Side Effects:** Skin irritation, allergic reactions, gastrointestinal upset, seizures (rare).
- **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, breastfeeding, hormone-sensitive conditions, hypersensitivity to fennel or related plants, concomitant use of antibiotics or CYP3A4 substrates.
- **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 substrates, anticoagulants, hormonal contraceptives, ciprofloxacin, tamoxifen.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
- **Dosage:** Varies depending on formulation and age.  See detailed dosage section.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for allergic reactions, respiratory issues, and gastrointestinal upset. With prolonged use, liver and kidney function should be monitored.

## **Popular Combinations**

Fennel is sometimes combined with other herbs for specific uses, such as colic relief (with lemon balm and German chamomile). However, these combinations may not have robust clinical evidence.

## **Precautions**

Pre-screening for allergies and assessment of existing medical conditions, especially hormone-sensitive conditions, are essential. Use caution in children and elderly individuals. Advise patients about potential drug interactions, including with over-the-counter medications and supplements. Avoid concomitant use with antibiotics and medications metabolized by CYP3A4.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid fennel oil.
