## **Usage**

- Fenticonazole nitrate is prescribed for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (vaginal yeast infection), a common fungal infection caused by *Candida albicans*. It is also effective against other fungi and yeasts, including dermatophytes (such as *Trichophyton*, *Microsporum*, *Epidermophyton*), and has shown some activity against Gram-positive bacteria and *Trichomonas vaginalis*.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antifungal (Imidazole derivative).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Fenticonazole inhibits the synthesis of ergosterol, a crucial component of the fungal cell membrane. This disruption leads to increased permeability of the fungal cell wall, causing cell death. Additionally, it inhibits the secretion of aspartic proteases by *Candida albicans*, which contributes to its pathogenicity.

## **Alternate Names**

- Fenticonazole nitrate.
- **Brand Names:** Lomexin, Gynoxin, Fentizol, Fentisoft, Novofenti.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Fenticonazole exerts its antifungal effect by primarily targeting ergosterol synthesis, a critical component of fungal cell membranes. This leads to increased cell wall permeability and ultimately fungal cell death.  Additionally, it inhibits the secretion of acidic proteases by *Candida albicans*.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** After vaginal administration, systemic absorption is negligible (around 0.58% to 1.81% of the administered dose). This low systemic absorption minimizes the risk of systemic side effects.  Metabolism and elimination pathways are not well-characterized due to the minimal absorption, but it's likely that whatever small amount gets absorbed will go through hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** At a molecular level, Fenticonazole inhibits the enzyme lanosterol 14Î±-demethylase, which is essential for ergosterol biosynthesis.  It also interferes with the activity of cytochrome oxidases and peroxidases.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Due to low systemic absorption, information on specific elimination pathways is limited.  Hepatic metabolism and renal excretion are likely involved for the small fraction that's absorbed.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **200 mg vaginal capsule:** Insert one capsule deeply into the vagina at bedtime for three consecutive nights.
- **600 mg vaginal capsule:** Insert one capsule deeply into the vagina as a single dose at bedtime.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for children under 16 years of age. For adolescents above 16, the adult dosage applies.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients (over 60):** Use with caution under the supervision of a physician.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is typically needed due to minimal systemic absorption. However, caution is advised and supervision from a physician is necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is typically needed.  However, it is recommended to use with physician supervision.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consideration and appropriate adjustments should be based on a comprehensive patient assessment.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Fenticonazole is specifically indicated for vulvovaginal candidiasis.  It's not systemically administered, so it's not relevant in scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are not typically necessary due to the minimal systemic absorption following vaginal administration.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Local irritation (burning, itching, redness) at the application site.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions (rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Data is limited due to short-term treatment duration.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Severe allergic reactions.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to fenticonazole or other imidazole antifungals.

## **Drug Interactions**

- May damage latex contraceptives (condoms, diaphragms).  Alternative contraceptive methods should be used during treatment and for a few days afterwards.
- Spermicides: Concurrent use is not recommended as local vaginal treatment may inactivate spermicides.
- Limited data on other drug interactions due to low systemic absorption. However, it is essential to inform the doctor of all current medications.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Limited data available. Use only if clearly necessary and under strict medical supervision.  The applicator should not be used during pregnancy.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Limited data available. Use only if clearly necessary and under strict medical supervision.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits ergosterol synthesis, disrupts fungal cell membrane.
- **Side Effects:** Local irritation, rarely allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to fenticonazole or imidazoles.
- **Drug Interactions:** May damage latex contraceptives, spermicides.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if clearly needed and under medical supervision.
- **Dosage:** 200 mg/day for 3 days or a single 600 mg dose, vaginally.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Resolution of symptoms.

## **Popular Combinations**

Not applicable for this locally acting medication.

## **Precautions**

- Discontinue use if hypersensitivity or allergic reaction occurs.
- Avoid concurrent use of latex contraceptives, spermicides and other vaginal products.
- Avoid sexual intercourse during treatment and for a few days after.
- Maintain good hygiene to prevent re-infection.
