## **Usage**

Feracrylum is prescribed as a local hemostatic and topical antiseptic. It is used to control capillary bleeding from minor cuts, wounds, abrasions, and burns.  It also has antimicrobial properties against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and fungi, thus preventing wound infections.  Pharmacologically, it is classified as a hemostatic agent and antiseptic. Its mechanism of action involves forming a complex with albumin protein in the blood, which promotes clot formation and stops bleeding. It also exerts antimicrobial action by disrupting bacterial and fungal cell walls.

## **Alternate Names**

Some alternate names and brand names include Hemolok, Sepgard, Themiseal, Uniheal, Supraheal, Sicastat, and Ferasep.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Feracrylum acts locally at the wound site. Upon contact with blood, it forms a complex with albumin, creating a gel-like matrix that acts as a physical barrier. This barrier stops bleeding (hemostatic action) and protects the wound from contamination.  It also has antiseptic properties that help eliminate a broad spectrum of microorganisms, preventing infections.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Feracrylum is applied topically and is minimally absorbed systemically. Due to limited systemic absorption, detailed pharmacokinetic data (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) are not readily available.

**Mode of Action:**  Feracrylum's hemostatic action is based on its interaction with albumin, leading to clot formation. Its antiseptic effect results from disrupting bacterial and fungal cell walls. No receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation is involved in its mechanism of action.  Elimination pathways are not well-characterized due to negligible systemic absorption.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin film of Feracrylum gel or solution to the cleaned and dried affected area once or twice daily.  Alternatively, a tulle-cotton or gauze dressing saturated with Feracrylum solution can be applied directly to the wound.  For solutions, undiluted application or pouring onto the bleeding surface is recommended.


#### **Children:** Feracrylum should be used cautiously in children. The dosage and application should be determined by a healthcare professional based on the child's age, weight, and the severity of the wound.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required, but monitoring for potential skin irritation is advised.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically needed due to minimal systemic absorption. However, caution is advised.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically needed due to minimal systemic absorption. However, caution is advised.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Patients with known allergies to Feracrylum or taking epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) should not use this medication.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Specific dosage recommendations for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations have not been specified in the provided sources.  Consult specialized literature or guidelines for specific recommendations in these settings.  In surgical settings, it is often used as an adjunct to conventional hemostatic agents for capillary and venous oozing.  It can also be used in dental extractions and oral surgeries.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modification is not typically necessary for renal or hepatic impairment due to limited systemic absorption.  However, always exercise caution in patients with these conditions.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
- Burning sensation
- Irritation at the application site

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis, though rare)
- Skin sensitivity issues (with prolonged use)

### **Long-Term Effects**

No long-term effects have been reported in the sources provided.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Anaphylaxis is a rare but severe ADR requiring immediate medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to Feracrylum
- Concomitant use of epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA)

## **Drug Interactions**

- Epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) interacts with Feracrylum, reducing its efficacy and potentially causing chemical burns.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of Feracrylum during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been definitively established. Consult a doctor before use.  Limited data is available regarding fetal risks, teratogenicity, and neonatal side effects.  Always weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Forms a complex with albumin, promoting clot formation and providing an antimicrobial barrier.
- **Side Effects:** Burning sensation, irritation, rarely allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, concomitant use of EACA.
- **Drug Interactions:** EACA.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Safety not established, consult a doctor.
- **Dosage:** Topical application, thin film once or twice daily.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Observe for local skin reactions and signs of infection.

## **Popular Combinations**

Feracrylum is sometimes combined with Centbucridine in a gel formulation for enhanced antimicrobial and wound healing properties.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Clean the wound before applying.  For external use only. Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Discontinue use if irritation persists.
- **Specific Populations:** See Pregnancy and Breastfeeding, Children dosage section.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** No specific restrictions on driving or operating machinery are typically necessary.  While no specific interaction with alcohol is noted, limiting intake is generally advised.
