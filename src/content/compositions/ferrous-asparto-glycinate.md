## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Ferrous asparto glycinate is primarily prescribed for the treatment and prevention of iron deficiency anemia.  It is also used to address nutritional deficiencies, especially during periods of increased iron demand like pregnancy and lactation.  It can be beneficial in cases of chronic or acute blood loss.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Hematinic, Mineral Supplement.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Ferrous asparto glycinate provides a readily absorbable form of iron. Iron is an essential component of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body.  Supplemental iron replenishes depleted iron stores, enabling the production of red blood cells and improving oxygen transport.

## **Alternate Names**

- Iron(II) asparto glycinate
- Ferrous(II) bis(aspartato)glycinate
- Brand Names:  Several brand names exist depending upon the manufacturer and may contain additional vitamins and minerals including folic acid, B vitamins, and Vitamin C. Some examples of these brand names include:  Niferex, Chromagen, Prenate DHA, Prenate Mini.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ferrous asparto glycinate increases serum iron levels, which stimulates erythropoiesis (red blood cell production) in the bone marrow. This leads to a rise in hemoglobin concentration and red blood cell count, ultimately improving oxygen delivery to tissues.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** The chelated form of iron in ferrous asparto glycinate is absorbed more efficiently in the gastrointestinal tract compared to some other iron salts. Absorption can be enhanced by the presence of vitamin C.  Absorption is reduced by antacids, dairy products, and eggs.
    - **Metabolism:** Iron is incorporated into hemoglobin within red blood cells. Excess iron is stored in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow as ferritin and hemosiderin.
    - **Elimination:** Iron is primarily lost through shedding of cells from the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and urinary tract. Very little iron is excreted in urine or bile.

- **Mode of Action:** Iron from ferrous asparto glycinate is absorbed into enterocytes (cells lining the intestines). It then binds to transferrin, a protein that transports iron in the blood, and is delivered to the bone marrow for hemoglobin synthesis.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Not directly applicable.  Iron's role is primarily structural in hemoglobin.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Typical dosage: 100-200 mg of elemental iron per day, administered in divided doses. This usually corresponds to one or two tablets/capsules of commercially available formulations.
- Maximum daily dose:  Should be determined based on individual patient needs and tolerance, usually not exceeding 400mg per day.

#### **Children:**

- Pediatric dosing: Determined by a physician based on the child's age, weight, and iron status.
- Pediatric safety considerations: Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep out of reach of children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary due to potential age-related decreases in renal or hepatic function. Start at the lower end of the dosing range.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised.  Dose adjustments may be needed based on the degree of renal dysfunction.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advised.  Dose adjustments may be needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Individualized dosing considerations may be needed for patients with heart disease, liver disease, or gastrointestinal disorders.



### **Clinical Use Cases**  The provided research focused on the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia and did not cover dosing in specific clinical situations.  Dosing in clinical situations such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, and emergency situations should be determined by the attending physician or a consulting hematologist.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose modifications are necessary based on patient response, hemoglobin levels, and potential adverse effects.  Adjustments may also be needed for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

## **Side Effects**

- Constipation
- Diarrhea
- Dark stools
- Stomach upset

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)

## **Drug Interactions**

- Antacids, tetracycline antibiotics, quinolone antibiotics, levothyroxine, levodopa, bisphosphonates, and penicillamine can decrease the absorption of ferrous asparto glycinate.
- Alcohol can affect iron absorption.
- Dairy products and eggs reduce absorption.
- Certain anti-seizure medications (e.g., phenytoin) and methyldopa may interact.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Pregnancy Safety Category:  A (Generally considered safe when used as directed).
- Fetal risks: Although generally safe, excessive iron intake during pregnancy could potentially pose risks.  Adhere to recommended dosages.
- Breastfeeding:  Ferrous asparto glycinate passes into breast milk.  Consult a physician before use.
- Alternative safer options: If necessary, discuss other iron supplement options with a physician.
