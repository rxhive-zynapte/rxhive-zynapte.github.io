## **Usage**

Fesoterodine fumarate is prescribed for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) in adults and neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) in children 6 years and older.  OAB is characterized by symptoms of urinary urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence. NDO refers to increased bladder contractions due to neurological conditions like spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis.

It is pharmacologically classified as a **competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist**, specifically targeting M3 receptors in the bladder.

Fesoterodine's mechanism of action involves blocking the binding of acetylcholine to M3 receptors in the bladder's smooth muscle. This inhibits detrusor muscle contractions, reducing urinary urgency, frequency, and incontinence episodes.


## **Alternate Names**

The active metabolite of fesoterodine is 5-hydroxymethyltolterodine (5-HMT).  The drug is commonly marketed under the brand name **Toviaz**.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Fesoterodine is a prodrug metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 to its active metabolite, 5-HMT.  5-HMT competitively binds to muscarinic M3 receptors in the detrusor muscle of the bladder, reducing its contractility and decreasing OAB symptoms.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Fesoterodine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1 to 6 hours for fesoterodine and 3 to 8 hours for 5-HMT. It has good oral bioavailability. 5-HMT is primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism, with a small amount excreted renally. The elimination half-life of 5-HMT is about 7 hours.

**Mode of Action:**  5-HMT acts as a competitive inhibitor at muscarinic M3 receptors, preventing acetylcholine from binding and stimulating detrusor muscle contraction. This decreases bladder pressure and the sensation of urgency.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**  Fesoterodine itself has little to no affinity for muscarinic receptors. Its active metabolite, 5-HMT, selectively binds to M3 receptors in the bladder.

**Elimination Pathways:** Fesoterodine is primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4 enzymes, and 5-HMT is further metabolized by other enzymes.  A small portion of the drug is eliminated unchanged via renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The recommended initial dose is 4 mg orally once daily. The dose may be increased to 8 mg orally once daily based on individual response and tolerability.

#### **Children (6 years and older):**

* **Weighing 25 kg up to 35 kg:** 4 mg orally once daily. The dose may be increased to 8 mg orally once daily.
* **Weighing more than 35 kg:** 4 mg orally once daily initially. After one week, the dose may be increased to 8 mg orally once daily.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is generally recommended.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    * **Mild to moderate (CrCl â‰¥ 30 mL/min):** No dosage adjustment necessary.
    * **Severe (CrCl < 30 mL/min):** Maximum dose of 4 mg once daily.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution.  Dose adjustment may be necessary. Patients with severe hepatic impairment should avoid Fesoterodine.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal disorders or bladder outlet obstruction.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Fesoterodine is not specifically indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its use is limited to OAB and NDO management.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be required in patients with renal impairment, hepatic impairment, or those taking potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole). Concomitant use with potent CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended.


## **Side Effects**

Dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, dizziness, drowsiness, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, abdominal pain, nausea, headache.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Angioedema (including swelling of face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx), anaphylaxis, urinary retention, severe allergic reactions, QT prolongation.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Limited data are available on long-term effects. Chronic complications are usually related to continued side effects like dry mouth or constipation.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Clinically significant ADRs include angioedema, urinary retention, and severe allergic reactions requiring immediate medical attention.
