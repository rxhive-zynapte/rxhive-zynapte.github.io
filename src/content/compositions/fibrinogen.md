      How is the dose of Fibrinogen calculated for congenital deficiency?**

      **A:**  The dose is calculated based on the target fibrinogen level,

      fibrinogen level is unknown, a standard dose of 70 mg/kg is recommended.

## **Usage**

- Fibrinogen is prescribed for the treatment of bleeding caused by hypofibrinogenemia (low levels of fibrinogen) in patients with congenital or acquired fibrinogen deficiency. It is crucial for blood clot formation and wound healing.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Hemostatic agent,  replacement factor.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Fibrinogen is converted to fibrin by thrombin during the coagulation cascade. Fibrin monomers polymerize to form a stable clot, which stops bleeding.

## **Alternate Names**

- Factor I
- Fibrinogen Concentrate
- **Brand Names:** FIBRYGA, RiaSTAP, others (availability may vary by region).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Fibrinogen increases plasma fibrinogen levels, promoting hemostasis. Its primary effect is within the vascular system. 
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Administered intravenously, achieving immediate systemic availability.
    - **Metabolism:**  Primarily metabolized through normal fibrinolytic pathways.
    - **Elimination:**  The breakdown products of fibrin are cleared through multiple pathways. Half-life is 72-120 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Thrombin cleaves fibrinogen to form fibrin monomers, which spontaneously polymerize into a fibrin clot.  Factor XIIIa crosslinks these polymers, stabilizing the clot. 
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Not applicable.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Breakdown products are cleared through general metabolic processes.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- Acquired Fibrinogen Deficiency: 4 g IV. Further doses may be needed based on fibrinogen level and clinical response.
- Congenital Fibrinogen Deficiency: Dose calculation based on target and measured fibrinogen levels (see below).

#### **Children:**
- Acquired Fibrinogen Deficiency:
    - Adolescents (≥12 years): 50 mg/kg IV.
    - Children (<12 years): 70 mg/kg IV.
- Congenital Fibrinogen Deficiency:  Dose calculation based on target and measured fibrinogen levels (see below).


#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be needed based on individual patient factors like renal or hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution advised; dose adjustment based on the degree of impairment and clinical response may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution; monitor for thrombotic events.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Individualized dosing may be required. Careful monitoring is recommended.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing is guided by fibrinogen levels and clinical bleeding:

- **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use/Emergency Situations:** Dose according to acquired or congenital deficiency guidelines and clinical context.  Target fibrinogen levels often higher in major bleeding or surgical settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

-  For congenital fibrinogen deficiency, when fibrinogen levels are known:
    - Adults and adolescents (≥12 years): Dose (mg/kg) = [Target fibrinogen level (mg/dL) - Measured fibrinogen level (mg/dL)] x 1.8
    - Children (<12 years): Dose (mg/kg) = [Target fibrinogen level (mg/dL) - Measured fibrinogen level (mg/dL)] x 1.4
- Target fibrinogen levels:  100 mg/dL for minor bleeding; 150 mg/dL for major bleeding.
- If fibrinogen level is unknown, 70 mg/kg IV is recommended. Monitor fibrinogen levels and adjust dose as needed.

## **Side Effects**

- Nausea, vomiting
- Fever, chills

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
