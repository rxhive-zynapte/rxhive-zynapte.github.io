## **Usage**

Filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA) is not a medication itself, but a key component of acellular pertussis vaccines. These vaccines are used to prevent pertussis (whooping cough), a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the bacterium *Bordetella pertussis*. FHA is one of the purified *B. pertussis* antigens included in these vaccines, alongside pertussis toxoid (PT), pertactin (PRN), and fimbriae (FIM).  These components work together to elicit an immune response against *B. pertussis*. FHA's primary role in the vaccine is as an immunogen, stimulating the body to produce antibodies against FHA, which then help to protect against *B. pertussis* infection.  It belongs to the pharmacological classification of vaccines.

## **Alternate Names**

FHA is also known as FhaB.  Brand names of vaccines containing FHA include Boostrix, Adacel, and Infanrix, among others. The specific antigens and their amounts can vary depending on the brand and intended age group.


## **How It Works**

### Pharmacodynamics

FHA is an adhesin, meaning it helps *B. pertussis* bind to cells in the respiratory tract. By including FHA in vaccines, the body generates antibodies that can block this binding, preventing the bacteria from attaching and colonizing the respiratory tract. FHA is thought to play a crucial role in mediating adherence to host cells, thereby promoting infection by *B. pertussis*. However, the exact binding partners and mechanisms are still being investigated.  Recent research indicates that FHA might not interact directly with the Î²2 integrin CD11b/CD18 on host phagocytic cells as previously thought.

### Pharmacokinetics

As a vaccine component, FHA is administered intramuscularly. It's expected to be processed like other protein antigens in vaccines.  The immune system recognizes FHA as foreign, leading to B cell activation and antibody production.  While specific pharmacokinetic data on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of FHA as a vaccine component are not readily available, the generated antibodies are likely cleared through normal antibody catabolism.


## **Dosage**

FHA is not administered as a standalone drug; it's a component of combination vaccines.  Dosage and administration are therefore dependent on the specific vaccine product.  Refer to the specific product information for the chosen vaccine (e.g., Boostrix, Adacel) for detailed dosage guidelines for various age groups (infants, children, adolescents, adults, and pregnant women).


## **Side Effects**

Side effects are generally mild and transient, similar to those associated with other vaccines.  Common side effects can include pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site, as well as fever, fatigue, and headache.  Rare but serious side effects might include severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).


## **Contraindications**

Contraindications include a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the pertussis-containing vaccine or encephalopathy within 7 days of a previous dose of a pertussis-containing vaccine.


## **Drug Interactions**

As with other vaccines, immunosuppressants can reduce the immune response. Consult relevant literature or the vaccine's package insert for potential interactions with specific medications.  Studies have shown that concomitant administration of Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis) vaccine with certain vaccines, such as the RSV vaccine ABRYSVO, can lead to lower geometric mean antibody concentrations for the pertussis components.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pertussis vaccination, including those containing FHA, is routinely recommended for pregnant women, ideally during the third trimester, to provide passive immunity to the infant.  Antibodies generated by the mother can be transferred to the fetus, offering protection during the first few months of life.  Data suggest that breastfeeding could potentially provide additional protection to the infant due to transfer of anti-pertussis antibodies in breast milk, but the extent of this protection needs further research.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** FHA acts as an immunogen, stimulating antibody production that inhibits *B. pertussis* adherence to respiratory tract cells.
* **Side Effects:** Injection site reactions, fever, fatigue. Rarely, severe allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Previous severe allergic reaction or encephalopathy following pertussis vaccination.
* **Drug Interactions:** Immunosuppressants might decrease the immune response. Consult product information for specific interactions.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Recommended during pregnancy (third trimester). Potential added protection through breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** Determined by the specific combination vaccine formulation. Consult product information.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Observe for any allergic reactions or unusual symptoms.


## **Popular Combinations**

FHA is combined with PT, PRN, and FIM in acellular pertussis vaccines. These are often further combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (e.g., Tdap) and other vaccines like inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) or *Haemophilus influenzae* type b (Hib) vaccine in formulations such as Boostrix-Polio, Pentacel, and Infanrix Hexa.


## **Precautions**

Screen for previous allergic reactions or contraindications before administering pertussis-containing vaccines.  Follow standard vaccination precautions, including appropriate injection techniques and monitoring for adverse events.
