## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Finasteride is primarily prescribed for two conditions in men:
    - **Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH):**  Also known as an enlarged prostate, BPH causes urinary problems such as difficulty urinating, weak stream, and frequent nighttime urination.  Finasteride helps shrink the prostate and alleviate these symptoms.
    - **Androgenetic Alopecia:** This is the most common type of hair loss in men, characterized by a receding hairline and thinning hair on the crown. Finasteride helps slow down hair loss and may even promote some hair regrowth.  It is not FDA approved to treat receding hairlines in women.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** 5-alpha reductase inhibitor.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Finasteride inhibits the enzyme type II 5-alpha reductase, which converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT).  DHT is a hormone responsible for prostate growth and plays a role in male pattern baldness. By reducing DHT levels, finasteride helps shrink the prostate and slow down hair loss.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:**  No significant variations in the generic name.

- **Brand Names:** Proscar (5mg, for BPH), Propecia (1mg, for hair loss).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Finasteride selectively inhibits type II 5-alpha reductase, leading to a decrease in DHT levels in the scalp and prostate.  It has minimal effect on type I 5-alpha reductase.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Well-absorbed orally.
    - **Metabolism:** Hepatically metabolized via CYP3A4 enzymes.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted primarily in the urine and to a lesser extent in feces.
    - **Half-life:**  Approximately 5-6 hours in adults (longer in elderly patients).

- **Mode of Action:** Finasteride competitively binds to and inhibits type II 5-alpha reductase, preventing the conversion of testosterone to DHT.  This reduces the stimulation of androgen receptors in the prostate and hair follicles.

- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**  Type II 5-alpha reductase inhibition.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Hepatic metabolism, renal and fecal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **BPH:** 5mg orally once daily.
- **Androgenetic Alopecia:** 1mg orally once daily.

#### **Children:**  Not indicated for use in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is generally required, but monitoring is recommended.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary for non-dialyzed patients.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution.  Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with liver disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Finasteride is not indicated for use in the clinical settings listed (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, and Emergency Situations).


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with hepatic impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- **BPH:** Decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, gynecomastia (breast enlargement or tenderness).
- **Hair Loss:** Decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, difficulty breathing).
- Breast changes (lumps, pain, nipple discharge).
- Depression, suicidal ideation.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Some sexual side effects may persist even after discontinuation of the drug.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to finasteride.
- Pregnancy (women should not handle crushed or broken tablets).
- Use in women (especially those who are or may become pregnant).


## **Drug Interactions**

- No clinically significant drug interactions have been identified. Finasteride is not known to interact with the CYP450 system to any significant extent.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** X (Contraindicated).
- **Fetal Risks:** Finasteride can cause abnormalities of the external genitalia in male fetuses.
- **Breastfeeding:** Not indicated for use in breastfeeding women. It is unknown if finasteride is excreted in human milk.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits type II 5-alpha reductase, decreasing DHT levels.
- **Side Effects:**  Decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, gynecomastia.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, pregnancy, use in women.
- **Drug Interactions:** No clinically significant interactions.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** BPH: 5mg/day, Hair loss: 1mg/day.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (for BPH), monitor for sexual side effects.


## **Popular Combinations**

- **BPH:** Finasteride is sometimes combined with alpha-blockers (e.g., doxazosin) for improved symptom relief.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Monitor patients for sexual side effects, psychiatric symptoms, and breast changes.
- **Specific Populations:**  See above sections on pregnancy, breastfeeding, and children.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Alcohol consumption may exacerbate some side effects. No specific restrictions on driving or operating machinery are generally necessary.
