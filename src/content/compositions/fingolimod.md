## **Usage**

Fingolimod is prescribed for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) in adults and children aged 10 years and older. This includes clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting MS, and active secondary progressive MS.  It's classified as a disease-modifying therapy (DMT), specifically a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator. Fingolimod works by preventing lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) from leaving the lymph nodes. This reduces the number of lymphocytes in the blood that can attack the central nervous system, thus decreasing inflammation and MS relapses.

## **Alternate Names**

Fingolimod hydrochloride is the chemical name. Gilenya is a common brand name.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Fingolimod is a prodrug, meaning it is inactive until metabolized in the body. It is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase 2 to its active metabolite, fingolimod-phosphate. Fingolimod-phosphate acts as a functional antagonist of S1P receptors, specifically S1P1 receptors found on lymphocytes. This prevents lymphocytes from egressing from lymphoid tissues, reducing their circulation in the blood and their infiltration into the central nervous system.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Fingolimod is readily absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentration within 1 to 4 hours. It undergoes extensive metabolism, primarily via phosphorylation to fingolimod-phosphate.  It's also metabolized through other pathways including CYP450 enzymes.  The drug and its metabolites are eliminated slowly, primarily via hepatic metabolism, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 6 to 9 days.  Excretion of fingolimod is predominantly via feces.

**Mode of Action:** Fingolimod-phosphate binds to S1P1 receptors on lymphocytes, internalizing these receptors. This internalization renders the lymphocytes insensitive to the S1P gradient, effectively trapping them in the lymph nodes and preventing their migration to sites of inflammation in the central nervous system.

**Elimination pathways**: Primarily hepatic metabolism and biliary/fecal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
0.5 mg orally once daily.

#### **Children (10 years and older):**

* ≤ 40 kg: 0.25 mg orally once daily.
* > 40 kg: 0.5 mg orally once daily.

Pediatric patients who start on 0.25 mg and subsequently reach a stable weight above 40 kg should switch to the 0.5 mg dose.  Repeat the first-dose monitoring procedure upon switching to the higher dose.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is generally necessary. However, careful monitoring is advisable due to potential age-related decline in organ function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is generally necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Close monitoring is recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Dosage adjustments are usually not required for mild or moderate hepatic dysfunction.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized assessment and dosage adjustments may be needed based on specific conditions, such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Fingolimod is specifically indicated for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Its use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations is not relevant.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments should be considered for patients with severe hepatic impairment, based on individual response and tolerability.  Monitor for adverse events and adjust dosage accordingly.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Headache, influenza, cough, diarrhea, back pain, elevated liver enzymes, dizziness, fatigue, rash.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Bradycardia (especially after the first dose), macular edema, infections (including herpes zoster and PML),  hepatic dysfunction, hypertension, skin cancer, lymphoma.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Increased risk of skin cancer and lymphoma.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Serious infections, including PML, bradycardia, macular edema, hepatotoxicity.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to fingolimod
* Recent (within 6 months) myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, TIA, decompensated heart failure, or Class III/IV heart failure.
* Mobitz type II second-degree or third-degree atrioventricular block or sick sinus syndrome (unless patient has a functioning pacemaker).
* Baseline QTc interval ≥ 500 ms.
* Immunodeficiency syndrome
* Increased risk of opportunistic infections (including those receiving immunosuppressive therapies).
* Active chronic infections (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis).
* Pregnancy and women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception.


## **Drug Interactions**

Fingolimod interacts with various medications, including:

* Drugs that slow heart rate (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin).
* Certain antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., amiodarone, disopyramide).
* Immunosuppressants (e.g., natalizumab, rituximab).
* CYP450 enzyme inducers and inhibitors.


Consult a drug interaction database for a comprehensive list of potential interactions.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Fingolimod is contraindicated during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception. It's recommended to stop fingolimod at least two months before planning a pregnancy. 
Fingolimod should be avoided during breastfeeding due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** S1P receptor modulator that sequesters lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues, reducing lymphocyte migration to the CNS.
* **Side Effects:** Common: headache, influenza, cough, diarrhea. Serious: bradycardia, macular edema, infections.
* **Contraindications:**  Pregnancy,  immunodeficiency, recent cardiac events, certain arrhythmias, active infections.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Bradycardia-inducing drugs,  immunosuppressants,  CYP450 modulators.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 0.5 mg once daily. Children (≥10 years): 0.25 mg (≤40 kg) or 0.5 mg (>40 kg) once daily.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Heart rate (especially after the first dose),  blood pressure, liver function tests, complete blood count, ophthalmological exams.


## **Popular Combinations**

Fingolimod is generally used as monotherapy. Combining it with other DMTs is usually not recommended due to the increased risk of adverse events, especially infections.

## **Precautions**

* First-dose monitoring for bradycardia is essential.
* Monitor for infections, macular edema,  hepatic dysfunction,  hypertension, and skin changes.
* Contraception is crucial for women of childbearing potential.
