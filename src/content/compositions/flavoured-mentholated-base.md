## **Usage**

Flavored mentholated base itself is not a medicine, but rather an excipient used in various pharmaceutical preparations, particularly cough syrups and lozenges.  It acts as a vehicle for active ingredients and provides a soothing, cooling effect due to the presence of menthol. Products containing a flavored mentholated base are typically used to relieve symptoms associated with upper respiratory tract infections like the common cold, such as coughs, sore throats, and nasal congestion.  The specific pharmacological classification and mechanism of action depend on the active ingredients present in the formulation. For example, a cough syrup might contain dextromethorphan (an antitussive), chlorpheniramine (an antihistamine), and phenylephrine (a decongestant), all within a flavored mentholated base.  

## **Alternate Names**

There are no official alternate names for "Flavored Mentholated Base."  Variations may exist depending on the specific flavorings added (e.g., cherry-flavored mentholated base, honey-lemon mentholated base). Brand names of products utilizing this base are numerous and vary depending on the manufacturer and active ingredients included. Some examples seen in the source materials are Covonia and Tusq.

## **How It Works**

The "Flavored Mentholated Base" functions primarily as a delivery vehicle and provides symptomatic relief.  The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are largely determined by the active pharmaceutical ingredients incorporated into the base. Menthol, a key component, exerts its effects through TRPM8 receptor activation, leading to a cooling sensation. This can provide relief from the discomfort of a sore throat or cough. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion will be dependent on the active ingredients present.

## **Dosage**
