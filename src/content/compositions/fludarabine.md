      Are there any drug interactions I should be aware of?**


      **A:** Concomitant use of pentostatin should be avoided due to the

## **Usage**

- Fludarabine is primarily indicated for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in adult patients who have not responded to or whose disease has progressed during treatment with at least one standard alkylating-agent-containing regimen.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Fludarabine is an antineoplastic antimetabolite, specifically a purine nucleoside analogue.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Fludarabine interferes with DNA synthesis and repair, ultimately leading to cell death.  It is incorporated into DNA and RNA, inhibiting several enzymes involved in nucleic acid synthesis, including DNA polymerase, ribonucleotide reductase, and DNA primase.


## **Alternate Names**

- Fludarabine phosphate
- **Brand Names:** Fludara, Oforta

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Fludarabine's primary effect is cytotoxicity against actively proliferating lymphocytes, particularly B-cells.  This leads to a reduction in the number of malignant cells.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Following IV administration, fludarabine is rapidly and completely absorbed. Oral bioavailability is approximately 50-60%. Food does not significantly affect absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Fludarabine is rapidly dephosphorylated to 2F-ara-A, which is then taken up by cells and phosphorylated intracellularly to the active triphosphate form (2F-ara-ATP).
    - **Elimination:** Fludarabine is primarily excreted by the kidneys, with a small amount excreted in the bile. Renal impairment significantly affects elimination. It is partially metabolized by the liver.



- **Mode of Action:** Fludarabine's active metabolite (2F-ara-ATP) inhibits DNA synthesis by interfering with DNA polymerase and ribonucleotide reductase, leading to cell death. It incorporates into DNA and RNA strands, further disrupting nucleic acid function and repair mechanisms.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (CLL):**

- **IV:** 25 mg/m²  administered intravenously over approximately 30 minutes daily for 5 consecutive days, repeated every 28 days.
- **Oral:** 40 mg/m² administered orally once daily for 5 consecutive days, repeated every 28 days.


#### **Children:**

- Dosage must be determined by a physician based on the child's body surface area and specific condition. Pediatric safety and efficacy have not been fully established for all indications.



#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Close monitoring for toxicity is recommended, and dosage may need to be reduced.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose reduction is necessary. Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) 30-70 mL/min: Reduce dose up to 50%. CrCl <30 mL/min: Contraindicated. 
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific dosage adjustments are available; however, caution is advised due to potential for increased toxicity.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor closely for toxicity, and consider dose adjustments as needed.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Fludarabine's primary clinical use is in the management of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in adults. It is not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, the intensive care unit (ICU), or emergency situations.  Other uses may include certain lymphomas and some cases of acute leukemia.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments are based on renal function, age, and the presence of other comorbid conditions.
