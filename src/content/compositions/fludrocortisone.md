## **Usage**

Fludrocortisone is primarily prescribed for the treatment of:

* **Addison's disease:** This condition occurs when the adrenal glands do not produce sufficient amounts of certain hormones, including cortisol and aldosterone. Fludrocortisone is used as a replacement for aldosterone.
* **Salt-losing adrenogenital syndrome:** This group of inherited disorders affects the adrenal glands, leading to an excessive loss of salt through the urine. Fludrocortisone helps to retain salt and maintain electrolyte balance.
* **Orthostatic hypotension (off-label):**  In some cases, fludrocortisone is used to treat this form of low blood pressure, which causes dizziness or lightheadedness when standing up from a sitting or lying position.

**Pharmacological classification:** Mineralocorticoid (with some glucocorticoid activity).

**Mechanism of action:** Fludrocortisone acts as a synthetic mineralocorticoid, binding to mineralocorticoid receptors in the renal distal tubules and collecting ducts. This action promotes sodium reabsorption and water retention, along with increased excretion of potassium and hydrogen ions.  It also enhances vascular alpha-adrenergic receptor sensitivity leading to vasoconstriction. These effects help restore electrolyte balance and improve blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

* **Generic name:** Fludrocortisone acetate
* **Brand name:** Florinef (discontinued in some countries)

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Fludrocortisone increases sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the kidneys, leading to increased water retention, expansion of intravascular volume, and an increase in blood pressure. It has some glucocorticoid activity.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:** Well-absorbed orally.
* **Metabolism:** Hepatic metabolism via CYP enzymes (inducible).
* **Elimination:** Renal and biliary excretion.

**Mode of Action:** Binds to mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys, inducing the expression of permease, an enzyme that regulates cell permeability to sodium. This leads to increased sodium reabsorption and water retention, consequently increasing potassium and hydrogen ion excretion. Increased sodium and water retention expands intravascular volume, while increased vascular alpha-adrenergic receptor sensitivity results in vasoconstriction. This combination of effects helps manage orthostatic hypotension.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Primarily binds to mineralocorticoid receptors.  Some interaction with glucocorticoid receptors occurs due to its inherent glucocorticoid activity. Does not directly inhibit enzymes or modulate neurotransmitters.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion, with some biliary excretion.  Hepatic metabolism by CYP enzymes plays a role, making it susceptible to interactions with CYP inducers and inhibitors.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Addison's disease:** 0.1 mg orally once daily, usually in conjunction with a glucocorticoid like hydrocortisone. The dosage may range from 0.1 mg three times a week to 0.2 mg daily.
* **Salt-losing adrenogenital syndrome:** 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg orally daily.
* **Orthostatic hypotension:** Starting dose of 0.1 mg daily, increasing by 0.1 mg weekly up to a maximum of 1 mg daily, depending on blood pressure response.

#### **Children:**

* Dosing depends on age, weight, and the specific condition.  Consult a pediatric endocrinologist for appropriate recommendations.  Neonates may receive 50-200 mcg daily, and exceptionally 200-300 mcg daily. Children over two years of age may receive 50-200 mcg daily. Monitoring of electrolytes, blood pressure, and plasma renin activity is crucial.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Close monitoring for side effects like fluid retention, hypertension, and hypokalemia is essential. Dosage adjustments might be necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution due to potential for fluid overload.  No specific dosage adjustments are provided; close monitoring is crucial.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution.  No specific dosage adjustments are provided; close monitoring is necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution should be exercised in patients with hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes, gastrointestinal disorders, and other conditions, as fludrocortisone can exacerbate these conditions. Dose adjustments and careful monitoring are necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Fludrocortisone does not have a standard dosage for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  The primary indications remain Addison's disease and salt-losing adrenogenital syndromes.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, comorbid conditions (hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, etc.), and based on individual response and tolerance. Close monitoring of blood pressure, fluid status, and electrolytes is essential.
