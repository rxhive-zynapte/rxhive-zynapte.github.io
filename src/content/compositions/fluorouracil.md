  - q: >-
      How is DPD deficiency related to Fluorouracil therapy?**


      **A:**  Patients with DPD deficiency cannot metabolize fluorouracil
      effectively, leading to increased drug levels and a significantly higher
      risk of severe, even fatal, toxicity.  Testing for DPD deficiency is
      recommended before initiating treatment.

## **Usage**

Fluorouracil is an antineoplastic antimetabolite used to treat various types of cancers, including adenocarcinoma of the colon, rectum, breast, stomach, and pancreas.  It is also used topically to treat actinic keratosis, superficial basal cell carcinoma, and other skin cancers.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antineoplastic antimetabolite.

**Mechanism of Action:** Fluorouracil disrupts DNA and RNA synthesis by inhibiting thymidylate synthase, ultimately leading to cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

5-FU, 5-fluorouracil

**Brand Names:** Adrucil, Carac, Efudex, Fluoroplex, Tolak


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Fluorouracil is metabolized intracellularly to its active forms, which interfere with DNA and RNA synthesis by inhibiting thymidylate synthase. This leads to an imbalance of intracellular nucleotides and inhibition of cell growth and division.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Topical application has minimal systemic absorption. Intravenous administration results in rapid and complete systemic availability.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD).
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated renally.

**Mode of Action:**  Fluorouracil acts as a "suicide inhibitor" of thymidylate synthase, blocking the formation of thymidine, a crucial nucleotide for DNA synthesis.  This inhibition disrupts DNA replication and repair, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition:** Thymidylate synthase inhibition.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Intravenous:** Dosing varies widely based on cancer type and regimen, typically ranging from 200-600 mg/m² per dose, administered as bolus or infusion.
* **Topical (Actinic keratosis):** Apply a thin film to the affected area once or twice daily for 2-4 weeks (depending on concentration and brand).
* **Topical (Superficial basal cell carcinoma):** Apply twice daily for 3-6 weeks, sometimes up to 10-12 weeks.

#### **Children:** Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.  Limited use exists, but dosing must be determined by a doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Increased risk of toxicity; dose adjustment may be required.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment generally required, but caution is advised with severe insufficiency.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction needed for moderate to severe impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring is essential, particularly for those with cardiovascular disease or DPD deficiency.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing is highly individualized based on cancer type and specific regimen. Institutional protocols should be consulted. Examples:

* **Colon/Rectum Cancer:** 400 mg/m² IV bolus on Day 1, followed by 2400-3000 mg/m² continuous infusion over 46 hours every two weeks in combination with leucovorin, with or without oxaliplatin/irinotecan.
* **Breast Cancer:** 500-600 mg/m² IV on Days 1 and 8 every 28 days for 6 cycles as part of a multidrug regimen.
* **Gastric Cancer:** 200-1000 mg/m²/day continuous IV infusion over 24 hours (as part of a platinum-containing regimen).

Fluorouracil is not typically used in clinical scenarios such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations outside its role in cancer treatment.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage must be adjusted based on patient response, toxicity, renal/hepatic function, DPD activity, and other factors.  Dose reductions are common in cases of myelosuppression, mucositis, diarrhea, hand-foot syndrome, and organ toxicity.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, mucositis, anorexia, alopecia, hand-foot syndrome, skin reactions (topical use), myelosuppression.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

### **Long-Term Effects**

Secondary malignancies, infertility, chronic skin changes (topical use).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe myelosuppression, cardiotoxicity, neurotoxicity, allergic reactions.

## **Contraindications**

Pregnancy, DPD deficiency, severe bone marrow suppression, serious infection, hypersensitivity to fluorouracil.

## **Drug Interactions**

Numerous drug interactions exist; consult a comprehensive drug interaction database before co-administration. Some examples include:

* **CYP450 Interactions:** Minimal direct CYP450 interaction.

* **Food/Lifestyle:**  Grapefruit may increase fluorouracil levels.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy Safety Category:** D/X (contraindicated)

**Fetal Risks:**  Highly teratogenic; can cause fetal malformations and death.

**Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.

## **Drug Profile Summary**
