## **Usage**

Fluphenazine is prescribed for the management of manifestations of psychotic disorders, primarily schizophrenia.  It is also used to treat severe anxiety, tension states, and personality disorders. It belongs to the pharmacological classification of typical antipsychotics (also known as neuroleptics or major tranquilizers).  Fluphenazine works by blocking dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the brain, reducing the excessive dopamine activity associated with psychotic symptoms.

## **Alternate Names**

Fluphenazine is also known as fluphenazine hydrochloride or fluphenazine decanoate depending upon the formulation. It is marketed under various brand names, including Prolixin and Modecate.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Fluphenazine primarily acts as a dopamine D1 and D2 receptor antagonist in the brain. This action decreases dopamine neurotransmission, which is thought to be responsible for the antipsychotic effects. Fluphenazine also exhibits anticholinergic, antihistaminic, and alpha-adrenergic blocking properties, contributing to some of its side effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Oral fluphenazine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The bioavailability is variable. Intramuscular administration provides more predictable absorption. Fluphenazine decanoate, a long-acting formulation, is administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously and forms a depot, from which it is slowly released over several weeks.
* **Metabolism:** Fluphenazine is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP450 enzymes, primarily CYP2D6.
* **Elimination:** Fluphenazine and its metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine and to a lesser extent in feces.

**Mode of Action:** Fluphenazine binds to and blocks dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, predominantly in the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways of the brain, reducing dopaminergic neurotransmission and ameliorating positive symptoms of psychosis (hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking).

**Elimination Pathways:**  Fluphenazine is extensively metabolized in the liver via CYP450 enzymes, notably CYP2D6. Metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted primarily through the kidneys and, to a lesser extent, via biliary excretion into the feces.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral:** Initial dose: 2.5-10 mg/day, divided every 6-8 hours. Maintenance dose: 1-5 mg/day, often as a single dose. Maximum dose: 40 mg/day (doses above 20 mg/day should be used cautiously, and efficacy and safety beyond 40 mg are not established).
* **Intramuscular (Fluphenazine Hydrochloride):** Initial dose: 1.25 mg, then 2.5-10 mg/day divided every 6-8 hours (doses above 10 mg/day should be used cautiously). Switch to oral therapy when possible.
* **Intramuscular (Fluphenazine Decanoate):** Initial dose: 12.5-25 mg. Maintenance dose: 12.5-100 mg every 2-5 weeks (typically every 3-4 weeks), Maximum dose: 100 mg/injection.

#### **Children:** Fluphenazine is not generally recommended for children. There is limited data to guide pediatric dosing, and alternative antipsychotics with better-established safety profiles are typically preferred.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Initiate at a lower dose (1-2.5 mg/day orally or 6.25 mg IM for decanoate) and titrate cautiously due to increased sensitivity to extrapyramidal side effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution and monitor closely.  Dose adjustments might be required based upon creatinine clearance values.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution and monitor liver function tests closely. Dose adjustment might be needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in individuals with cardiovascular disease, epilepsy, diabetes, or other conditions. Careful monitoring and potential dose modifications might be needed.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Fluphenazine is generally not indicated for use in procedures like intubation, surgical settings, or during mechanical ventilation.  Its primary role is in the management of psychotic disorders. For sedation in such procedures, short-acting medications like benzodiazepines or other sedative agents are preferred.  Fluphenazine might be used in the ICU for managing acute psychotic exacerbations, but careful consideration of potential drug interactions and side effects is crucial.  For emergencies involving psychosis-related agitation or aggression, intramuscular fluphenazine hydrochloride can be employed.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments should be made based on patient response, tolerability, and clinical status. Monitor closely for side effects, particularly extrapyramidal symptoms. Consider therapeutic drug monitoring in some cases. Dose modifications are necessary for renal or hepatic impairment, comorbid conditions, and interacting medications.
