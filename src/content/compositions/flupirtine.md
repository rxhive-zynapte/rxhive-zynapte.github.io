      How does Flupirtine work to relieve pain?**


      **A:** Flupirtine activates Kv7 potassium channels and indirectly
      antagonizes NMDA receptors, leading to neuronal hyperpolarization and
      reduced pain signal transmission.

      Are there any specific monitoring requirements during Flupirtine

      **A:**  Yes, regular monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) is crucial
      due to the potential for hepatotoxicity.

      What should patients be advised regarding lifestyle while taking
      Flupirtine?**


      **A:** Patients should be advised that Flupirtine may cause drowsiness and
      should therefore avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until they
      know how it affects them. Alcohol should be avoided, as it can exacerbate
      the sedative effects.

## **Usage**

- Flupirtine is prescribed for acute and chronic pain, particularly musculoskeletal pain.  It was also used for pain following trauma or orthopedic surgery and injuries, tension headaches, dysmenorrhea, and cancer pain. Note that as of 2018, it is only indicated for acute pain and limited to a maximum of two weeks of treatment due to the risk of liver toxicity.
- **Pharmacological classification:**  Non-opioid analgesic, neuronal potassium channel opener.
- **Mechanism of action:** Flupirtine activates voltage-gated potassium channels, specifically the Kv7 family. This leads to neuronal hyperpolarization, reducing neuronal excitability and attenuating pain signal transmission.  It also acts as a functional NMDA receptor antagonist.


## **Alternate Names**

- Katadolon
- Flupirtin Maleat
- **Brand names:** Katadolon, Trancopal, Metanor


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Flupirtine's primary effect is analgesia achieved through the opening of Kv7 potassium channels and indirect NMDA receptor antagonism. It has also shown muscle relaxant properties due to inhibition of mono- and polysynaptic reflexes.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Flupirtine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration, with bioavailability of about 90% and rectal bioavailability about 70%. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within 1.6 to 2 hours after oral administration. Steady state is reached after approximately 2 days.
    - **Metabolism:** Flupirtine is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily via oxidative degradation and acetylation.  Major metabolites include p-fluorohippuric acid, an acetylated metabolite, and a mercapturic acid metabolite.
    - **Elimination:** Flupirtine and its metabolites are eliminated primarily through renal excretion (about 72%) and to a lesser extent in feces (about 18%).  The elimination half-life is approximately 6.5 hours in healthy adults, but it may be prolonged in elderly patients and those with renal impairment.
- **Mode of Action:** Flupirtine binds to and activates Kv7 potassium channels, leading to an efflux of potassium ions and hyperpolarization of neuronal membranes. This reduces neuronal excitability and inhibits pain signal transmission.  Its NMDA receptor antagonism further contributes to the analgesic effect.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**  Kv7 potassium channel opener, functional NMDA receptor antagonist.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion; some hepatic metabolism and fecal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

-  For acute pain: 100 mg every 4-6 hours, not exceeding 600mg per day. Treatment duration should not exceed two weeks.

#### **Children:**
