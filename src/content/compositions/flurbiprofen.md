      increased risk.  Renal function should be assessed before initiating
      treatment and monitored periodically during therapy.

## **Usage**

Flurbiprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is prescribed for:
- Relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis.
- Relief of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.
- Management of mild to moderate pain (e.g., dysmenorrhea, post-operative pain, dental pain, migraine).
- Treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, musculoskeletal disorders, and soft tissue injuries (e.g., bursitis, tendinitis).

**Pharmacological Classification:** Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), analgesic, antipyretic

**Mechanism of Action:** Flurbiprofen inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2), enzymes responsible for prostaglandin synthesis. Prostaglandins mediate inflammation, pain, and fever; hence, inhibiting their production results in therapeutic effects.

## **Alternate Names**

- Flurbiprofeno (Spanish)
- Flurbiprof√®ne (French)

**Brand Names:**
- Ansaid
- Froben
- Fluprofen
- Ocufen (ophthalmic formulation)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Flurbiprofen exerts its therapeutic effects by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, thereby reducing inflammation, pain, and fever.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

- **Absorption:** Flurbiprofen is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration.  Food or antacids may delay absorption but do not affect the total amount absorbed. Peak plasma concentrations are achieved in about 1-2 hours for oral tablets.
- **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver via hydroxylation and conjugation reactions.  Minimal chiral inversion from the R-enantiomer to the S-enantiomer occurs. Major metabolites include 4'-hydroxy-flurbiprofen, 3',4'-dihydroxy-flurbiprofen, 3'-hydroxy-4'-methoxy-flurbiprofen, and their conjugates.
- **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through renal excretion of metabolites.  Elimination may be slower in patients with renal impairment.

**Mode of Action:** Flurbiprofen competitively inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms, blocking the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Rheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoarthritis:** 200-300 mg/day orally, divided into 2-4 doses. Maximum single dose: 100 mg.  Adjust dose to the lowest effective level for maintenance.
- **Dysmenorrhea:** Initial dose: 100 mg, followed by 50-100 mg every 4-6 hours as needed. Maximum daily dose: 300 mg.
- **Mild to Moderate Pain:** 50-100 mg every 4-6 hours as needed.  Maximum daily dose: 300 mg.


#### **Children:**  Use is not recommended for children under 12 years of age.  Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric populations.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate therapy at the lowest effective dose and monitor closely. Reduced renal clearance may necessitate dose adjustments.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** In mild to moderate impairment, consider dose reduction. Flurbiprofen is contraindicated in severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min).
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Consider dose reduction in mild to moderate impairment. Flurbiprofen is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations have not been established for flurbiprofen. Its use in these settings should be considered carefully and individualized based on patient needs and clinical judgment.
