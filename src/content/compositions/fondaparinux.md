## **Usage**

Fondaparinux is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). It is also used in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), including unstable angina and myocardial infarction (MI) with or without ST-segment elevation.  It's pharmacological classification is an anticoagulant, specifically a Factor Xa inhibitor. Fondaparinux works by selectively binding to antithrombin III, which enhances antithrombin III's ability to inhibit Factor Xa. This interruption of the coagulation cascade prevents thrombin formation and thrombus development.

## **Alternate Names**

The international nonproprietary name (INN) is fondaparinux sodium. A popular brand name is Arixtra.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Fondaparinux selectively inhibits Factor Xa by binding to antithrombin III and potentiating its activity. It does not directly inhibit thrombin (Factor IIa) nor does it affect platelet function.  Routine coagulation tests like aPTT, ACT, PT/INR are generally not clinically affected.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Fondaparinux is administered subcutaneously and has nearly complete bioavailability.  Peak plasma concentrations are reached in approximately 2 hours. It has a half-life of 17-21 hours, which allows for once-daily dosing. Fondaparinux is primarily eliminated by the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** Fondaparinux selectively binds to antithrombin III. This binding significantly increases antithrombin III's ability to neutralize Factor Xa, thereby interrupting the coagulation cascade and preventing further clot formation.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Fondaparinux's primary mechanism is selective Factor Xa inhibition via antithrombin III potentiation.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **VTE Prophylaxis (Surgical):** 2.5 mg SC once daily, starting 6-8 hours post-op after hemostasis.
* **VTE Treatment (DVT/PE):**
    * <50 kg: 5 mg SC once daily
    * 50-100 kg: 7.5 mg SC once daily
    * >100 kg: 10 mg SC once daily
* **ACS (UA/NSTEMI/STEMI):** 2.5 mg SC (or IV for initial dose in STEMI) once daily.
* **Superficial Vein Thrombosis:** 2.5 mg SC once daily for 30-45 days.


#### **Children:**

Safety and efficacy not established in patients under 17. Limited data suggests dosing can be weight based (mg/kg).


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Strict adherence to timing of the first dose is essential, especially in those â‰¥75 years, with low body weight, or renal impairment.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    * CrCl 20-30 mL/min: 1.5 mg daily or 2.5 mg every other day for VTE prophylaxis.
    * CrCl <20 mL/min: Contraindicated.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No adjustment for mild to moderate impairment. Use with caution in severe impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Individualized assessment is needed, particularly in patients with a high bleeding risk.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Surgical Procedures:**  Dosage as per VTE prophylaxis.
* **Intubation, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use:**  Consider VTE prophylaxis or treatment based on individual risk assessment.
* **Emergency Situations:**  Fondaparinux's delayed onset of action makes it less suitable for emergencies requiring immediate anticoagulation.



### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments are primarily based on renal function and body weight.  Close monitoring for bleeding is required in patients with renal impairment, hepatic dysfunction, or other risk factors for bleeding.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Bleeding (e.g., bruising, bleeding gums, epistaxis), anemia,  pain at injection site.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Major bleeding (e.g., intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding), spinal/epidural hematoma (especially with neuraxial anesthesia), thrombocytopenia.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Osteoporosis with long-term use (rare).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe bleeding, allergic reactions (rare), thrombocytopenia.


## **Contraindications**

* Active major bleeding.
* Severe renal impairment (CrCl <20 mL/min).
* Bacterial endocarditis.
* Hypersensitivity to fondaparinux.


## **Drug Interactions**

Drugs that increase bleeding risk (e.g., NSAIDs, aspirin, other anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Limited data suggest potential placental transfer. Use only if clearly needed.  Breastfeeding is not recommended.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Selective Factor Xa inhibitor.
* **Side Effects:** Bleeding, anemia, injection site reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Active bleeding, severe renal impairment, hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Drugs that increase bleeding risk.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks. Not recommended while breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:**  Variable depending on indication and patient factors.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Signs of bleeding, hemoglobin, platelet count, renal function.


## **Popular Combinations**

Fondaparinux is often used in conjunction with warfarin for VTE treatment, with warfarin initiated as soon as possible and fondaparinux continued for at least 5 days and until therapeutic INR is achieved.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:**  Assess bleeding risk before initiating therapy.  Monitor for signs of bleeding.
* **Specific Populations:**  See dosage adjustments for renal and hepatic impairment, elderly patients, and pregnancy/breastfeeding.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Caution patients about activities that could increase bleeding risk.
