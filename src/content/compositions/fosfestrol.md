## **Usage**

- Fosfestrol is prescribed for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer in men. It is specifically used in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) when the disease progresses despite other interventions like orchiectomy, gonadotropin-releasing hormone modulators, and nonsteroidal antiandrogens. It has also been used to prevent the testosterone flare at the start of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy.
- **Pharmacological classification:**  Fosfestrol is a synthetic non-steroidal estrogen; antineoplastic agent; hormonal chemotherapy agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Fosfestrol acts as a prodrug of diethylstilbestrol (DES).  It is metabolized into DES, which then exerts its effects by binding to estrogen receptors. This leads to a reduction in androgen levels and inhibition of androgen action on prostate cancer cells, slowing their growth.

## **Alternate Names**

- Diethylstilbestrol diphosphate (DESDP)
- **Brand name:** Honvan

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Fosfestrol, after conversion to DES, acts as an estrogen receptor agonist. It binds to estrogen receptors, reducing the production of androgens like testosterone, thereby hindering the growth of prostate cancer cells that rely on these androgens for growth.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Fosfestrol is administered intravenously or orally.  Following intravenous administration, it is rapidly distributed and converted to diethylstilbestrol.  Oral administration requires a higher dosage due to the first pass effect.  DES is metabolized in the liver and is eliminated mainly via hepatic excretion in the bile with some renal excretion. The half life of DES is 20-24 hours
- **Mode of Action:** Fosfestrol inhibits androgen action on the prostate gland and hormone-induced cancer cell growth.  It competitively binds to androgen receptors, forming a drug-receptor complex that inhibits DNA synthesis and cell proliferation.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  The active metabolite DES undergoes hepatic metabolism and is eliminated primarily through biliary excretion, with a smaller proportion excreted renally.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Intravenous:** Initial: 600–1200 mg/day by slow intravenous infusion (over 1 hour) for 5–10 days, followed by 300 mg/day for 10–20 days.
- **Intravenous (Maintenance):** 300-600 mg, gradually reduced over several months from four times per week to once weekly dosing.
- **Oral:** Initial: 360–480 mg three times per day.
- **Oral (Maintenance):** 120-240 mg three times per day; may gradually reduce to 240 mg daily.


#### **Children:**

- Fosfestrol is not recommended for use in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to higher risk of adverse effects. Close monitoring is recommended.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be necessary due to slower elimination. Monitor renal function closely.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution as metabolism may be impaired.  Close monitoring is recommended.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Particular caution in patients with a history of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, blood clots, or liver problems. Monitor closely for potential exacerbations.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosage guidelines provided above apply to the clinical use of fosfestrol in the management of castration-resistant prostate cancer and the prevention of testosterone flare associated with GnRH agonist therapy. The specific dosage regimen should be tailored to the individual patient's clinical presentation, treatment response, and tolerance of side effects. Close monitoring and dose adjustments are essential, particularly in elderly patients and those with renal or hepatic impairment.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose modifications may be necessary based on renal/hepatic dysfunction and other relevant patient-specific factors.
- Consider genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism when making dosage adjustments.


## **Side Effects**
