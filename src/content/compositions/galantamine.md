## **Usage**

- Galantamine is prescribed for the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderately severe dementia of the Alzheimer's type.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Cholinesterase inhibitor, allosteric nicotinic receptor modulator.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Galantamine increases acetylcholine levels in the brain by reversibly inhibiting acetylcholinesterase. It also acts as an allosteric potentiating ligand at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, further enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:**  No widely recognized international or regional variations exist.
- **Brand Names:** Razadyne, Reminyl.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Galantamine enhances cholinergic function by inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine and modulating nicotinic receptors.  This leads to improved cognitive function in some patients with Alzheimer's disease.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Well-absorbed orally (90-100% bioavailability).
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes in the liver.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted mainly through the kidneys.  Plasma half-life is approximately 7 hours.
- **Mode of Action:**
    - **Receptor Binding:** Binds to the active site of acetylcholinesterase, preventing acetylcholine hydrolysis.  Also binds allosterically to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, increasing their sensitivity to acetylcholine.
    - **Enzyme Inhibition:** Reversibly inhibits acetylcholinesterase.
    - **Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Enhances the effects of acetylcholine, a key neurotransmitter involved in learning and memory.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion; hepatic metabolism via CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Extended-Release Capsules:**
    - Starting dose: 8 mg once daily in the morning with food.
    - Maintenance dose:  Increase to 16 mg/day after at least 4 weeks, then to 24 mg/day after another 4 weeks, based on clinical response and tolerability. Maximum: 24 mg/day.
- **Tablets/Oral Solution:**
    - Starting dose: 4 mg twice daily with food.
    - Maintenance dose: Increase to 8 mg twice daily after at least 4 weeks, then to 12 mg twice daily after another 4 weeks based on response and tolerability. Maximum: 24 mg/day.

#### **Children:** Use and dose must be determined by a physician and is not generally recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate at the lower end of the dosing range and titrate cautiously.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment (Creatinine Clearance <9 mL/min):** Contraindicated.  For creatinine clearance 9â€“59 mL/min, do not exceed 16 mg/day.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** For moderate impairment (Child-Pugh 7-9), start with 4 mg once daily, increasing to 4 mg twice daily. Do not exceed 8 mg twice daily. Contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh >9).
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Adjust dose based on individual assessment and potential drug interactions. Close monitoring is necessary for patients with cardiac conditions or a history of seizures.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Galantamine is specifically indicated for Alzheimer's dementia and does not have dosing guidelines for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. These procedures may necessitate other medications or different treatment approaches.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be needed based on individual patient characteristics, including renal or hepatic impairment, drug interactions, and other comorbidities. Titrate the dose cautiously, starting at the lowest recommended dose. Closely monitor for efficacy and tolerability.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, dizziness, headache, weight loss, and fatigue.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Bradycardia, syncope, heart block, seizures, gastrointestinal bleeding, severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Potential for chronic gastrointestinal issues, cardiovascular complications with pre-existing conditions, and worsening of underlying medical issues if not monitored properly.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Serious skin reactions, significant bradycardia, and syncope requiring urgent medical attention.  


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to galantamine.
- Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh >9).
- Severe renal impairment (Creatinine Clearance <9 mL/min).
- Mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction or recovery from gastrointestinal surgery.
- Urinary outflow obstruction or recovering from bladder surgery.

## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP450 Interactions:**  Metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Inhibitors of these enzymes (e.g., ketoconazole, paroxetine) may increase galantamine levels. Inducers may decrease levels.
- **Other Interactions:** Anticholinergics may antagonize galantamine's effects.  Drugs that prolong the QT interval or have cholinergic effects can increase the risk of adverse events. Neuromuscular blocking agents may be potentiated by galantamine.
- **Food and Lifestyle:** Limited data suggest no significant interactions with food or alcohol, but monitor for any unusual effects.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Data limited; potential fetal risks unknown. Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk.
- **Breastfeeding:** Galantamine is likely excreted in breast milk. Avoid use during breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Cholinesterase inhibitor and nicotinic receptor modulator.
- **Side Effects:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, bradycardia, syncope.
- **Contraindications:** Severe hepatic/renal impairment, hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:** CYP2D6/3A4 inhibitors/inducers, anticholinergics.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Data limited; use with caution if at all.
- **Dosage:** See detailed dosage section above.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Cognitive function, heart rate, blood pressure, liver and kidney function tests.


## **Popular Combinations**

- **Memantine:** Sometimes used in combination with galantamine in moderate to severe Alzheimer's, although the clinical benefit of combination therapy is not well-established.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Monitor liver and kidney function, cardiac status, and any history of seizures.  Ensure adequate hydration.
- **Specific Populations:** See dosage adjustments section.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Advise patients to avoid driving or operating machinery if experiencing dizziness or drowsiness.
