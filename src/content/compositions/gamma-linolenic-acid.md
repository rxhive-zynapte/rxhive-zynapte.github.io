## **Usage**

Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) is primarily used as an anti-inflammatory agent and for potential benefits in nerve pain (diabetic neuropathy), and certain skin conditions.  It is not classified as a drug and should not be used for treatment.  It is categorized as an omega-6 fatty acid and is available as a dietary supplement. GLA's mechanism involves conversion to dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), which reduces inflammation by competing with arachidonic acid and inhibiting the formation of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins.

## **Alternate Names**

- Gamolenic acid
- GLA
- (Z,Z,Z)-Octadeca-6,9,12-trienoic acid

GLA is found in borage oil, evening primrose oil, and black currant seed oil.  It is marketed under various brand names containing these oils.



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** GLA is metabolized to DGLA, which competes with arachidonic acid, thereby reducing the production of pro-inflammatory molecules like prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4.  This results in decreased inflammation and pain.

**Pharmacokinetics:** GLA is absorbed in the intestines and metabolized in the liver. It is mainly eliminated through bile and feces.  Precise details on receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation are limited. Elimination pathways are primarily hepatic, with biliary excretion playing a significant role.


## **Dosage**

Dosage guidelines for GLA are not standardized and vary widely depending on the source and intended use. It's important to consult a healthcare provider before recommending GLA supplements.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Daily doses range from 240 mg to 2.8 g, often divided into multiple doses taken with meals.

#### **Children:**

Dosages for children vary based on age and condition. Consult a pediatrician or healthcare professional for specific recommendations.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary depending on individual health status.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No specific dosage adjustments are indicated, but caution is advised.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific adjustments are mentioned, but caution should be exercised.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution and consultation with a physician are advised for patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or bleeding disorders.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

There is limited clinical research supporting the efficacy of GLA for these settings. It's not routinely used in these contexts, and the use of evening primrose oil in clinical settings is not well-established. Therefore, dosage recommendations are not readily available.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage modifications may be necessary for individuals with bleeding disorders or those taking anticoagulant medications, as GLA might slow blood clotting.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Soft stools
- Diarrhea
- Belching
- Gas
- Nausea
- Headache


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, dizziness, difficulty breathing)
- Seizures (especially in individuals with epilepsy or seizure disorders)



### **Long-Term Effects**

Limited information is available on long-term effects.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions and seizures require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

- Pregnancy (potential risk of early labor and fetal harm)
- Bleeding disorders
- Schizophrenia
- Epilepsy
- Hypersensitivity to GLA-containing oils


## **Drug Interactions**

- **Anticoagulants/Antiplatelet drugs:** GLA may potentiate the effects of these medications, increasing the risk of bleeding.
- **Anesthetics:** GLA might lower the seizure threshold, especially when used with anesthetics.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

GLA is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the potential risk of inducing labor and potential harm to the fetus.  Safety during breastfeeding is not established.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** GLA is converted to DGLA, which has anti-inflammatory effects by competing with arachidonic acid.
- **Side Effects:**  Gastrointestinal issues, headache, allergic reactions, seizures.
- **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, bleeding disorders, epilepsy, schizophrenia.
- **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, anesthetics.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy, safety unknown during breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** Varies depending on the condition; consult a healthcare professional.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  No specific parameters mentioned, but general health monitoring is recommended.


## **Popular Combinations**

No established or recommended popular combinations are available.  Always consult a healthcare provider before combining supplements.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Consult with a healthcare provider before starting GLA supplementation.  Use caution in individuals with bleeding disorders or epilepsy. Discontinue GLA use at least two weeks before surgery.
- **Specific Populations:** See Contraindications and Pregnancy and Breastfeeding sections.
