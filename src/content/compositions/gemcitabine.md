## **Usage**

Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog antimetabolite used to treat various types of cancer. It is prescribed for:

* **Bladder cancer:** As a single agent or in combination with cisplatin.
* **Breast cancer:** In combination with paclitaxel.
* **Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC):** As a single agent or in combination with cisplatin.
* **Ovarian cancer:** In combination with carboplatin.
* **Pancreatic cancer:** As a single agent.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antineoplastic antimetabolite.

**Mechanism of Action:** Gemcitabine inhibits DNA synthesis, leading to cell death. It is a prodrug that needs to be intracellularly metabolized to its active diphosphate and triphosphate nucleotide forms. Gemcitabine diphosphate inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, thus decreasing deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dCTP) available for DNA synthesis. Gemcitabine triphosphate competes with dCTP for incorporation into DNA, triggering apoptosis (programmed cell death).


## **Alternate Names**

* **Generic name:** Gemcitabine hydrochloride
* **Brand names:** Gemzar, Infugem

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Gemcitabine's primary effect is to inhibit DNA synthesis, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in rapidly dividing cancer cells.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Administered intravenously.
* **Metabolism:** Gemcitabine is a prodrug that is metabolized intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase to its active diphosphate and triphosphate nucleotides.
* **Elimination:** Primarily via renal excretion, with less than 10% excreted as unchanged drug. The half-life is relatively short, ranging from 42 to 94 minutes, depending on age and gender. Clearance is affected by age and gender, being lower in women and the elderly.

**Mode of Action:** Gemcitabine incorporates into DNA, causing "masked chain termination," halting further DNA synthesis and triggering apoptosis.

**Receptor binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Gemcitabine diphosphate inhibits ribonucleotide reductase.

**Elimination pathways:** Renal excretion is the main route. Hepatic metabolism also plays a role.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Dosage varies depending on the type of cancer and combination therapy. Generally, 1000 mg/m² to 1250 mg/m² is administered intravenously over 30 minutes. Specific dosing schedules are outlined below in Clinical Use Cases.

#### **Children:** Gemcitabine's safety and efficacy in children have not been fully established. Limited studies exist but do not provide sufficient data for standardized dosing.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Gemcitabine's clearance decreases, and half-life increases with age.  Dose adjustments are generally not necessary, but close monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Gemcitabine should be used with caution. No clear dosage guidelines exist for this population.  Close monitoring is crucial.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Gemcitabine should be used with caution. Dose reduction may be necessary, particularly in patients with hyperbilirubinemia.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider patient-specific factors and adjust dosage accordingly.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Bladder Cancer (single agent):** 1250 mg/m² IV over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle.
* **Bladder Cancer (combination with cisplatin):** 1000 mg/m² IV over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle, along with cisplatin (70 mg/m² on Day 1 or 2).
* **Breast Cancer (combination with paclitaxel):** 1250 mg/m² IV over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle with paclitaxel (175 mg/m² on Day 1).
* **NSCLC (single agent):** 1000 mg/m² IV over 30 minutes once weekly for three weeks followed by a one-week rest.
* **NSCLC (combination with cisplatin, 28-day schedule):** 1000 mg/m² IV over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle, with cisplatin (100 mg/m² on Day 1).
* **NSCLC (combination with cisplatin, 21-day schedule):** 1250 mg/m² IV over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle with cisplatin (100 mg/m² on Day 1).
* **Ovarian Cancer (combination with carboplatin):** 1000 mg/m² IV over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle, in combination with carboplatin (AUC 4 on Day 1).
* **Pancreatic Cancer:** 1000 mg/m² IV over 30 minutes once weekly for up to 7 weeks followed by a one-week rest; subsequent cycles: once weekly for 3 weeks out of every 4 weeks.
* **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use/Emergency Situations:** Gemcitabine does not have specific dosage recommendations for these scenarios. It's typically not used in these contexts.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based primarily on myelosuppression (bone marrow suppression). Monitor blood counts (neutrophils, platelets) before each dose. Dosage may need to be reduced or omitted if counts are low. Also, consider dose modifications for patients with hepatic or renal impairment.
