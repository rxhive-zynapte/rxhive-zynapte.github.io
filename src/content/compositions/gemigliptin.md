## Usage

Gemigliptin is an oral antihyperglycemic agent, specifically a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It is prescribed for:

*   Monotherapy: Initial treatment for patients with inadequate glycemic control through diet and exercise alone.
*   Dual therapy: In combination with metformin for patients inadequately controlled on metformin alone.
*   Triple therapy: Along with metformin and a sulfonylurea for individuals not adequately managed with the maximal tolerated dose of metformin and sulfonylurea.


Gemigliptin's mechanism of action involves inhibiting DPP-4, an enzyme that inactivates incretin hormones like glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP).  By increasing the levels of these hormones, gemigliptin enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppresses glucagon secretion, and reduces hepatic glucose production.

## Alternate Names

*   Zemiglo (brand name)

## How It Works

**Pharmacodynamics:** Gemigliptin primarily works by increasing the levels of active incretin hormones.  These hormones stimulate insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells in a glucose-dependent manner and reduce glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells. This, in turn, lowers hepatic glucose output and improves overall glycemic control.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Gemigliptin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) achieved in approximately 1-2 hours. Food does not significantly affect absorption.
*   **Metabolism:** Gemigliptin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, with a minor contribution from CYP2C9. An active metabolite is formed, which also contributes to the drug's effects.
*   **Elimination:** Gemigliptin is eliminated via both renal and hepatic routes, with approximately equal excretion in urine and feces.  The terminal half-life is approximately 17 hours, supporting once-daily dosing.

**Mode of Action:**  Gemigliptin acts as a competitive inhibitor of the DPP-4 enzyme. It selectively binds to the enzyme's active site, preventing the cleavage of incretin hormones and prolonging their activity.

## Dosage

### Standard Dosage

#### Adults:

50 mg orally once daily.  If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as remembered, but a double dose should not be taken on the same day.

#### Children:

The safety and effectiveness of gemigliptin in children under 18 years old have not been established.

#### Special Cases:

*   **Elderly Patients:**  No dosage adjustment is generally recommended, but caution should be exercised due to potential age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is required for mild to moderate impairment.  Use with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment due to limited clinical experience.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** If used in combination with a sulfonylurea, a lower dose of the sulfonylurea may be necessary to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Use with caution in patients with NYHA Class II-IV cardiac status or a history of pancreatitis.


### Clinical Use Cases

Gemigliptin is intended for the chronic management of type 2 diabetes and is not indicated for acute conditions like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest).

### Dosage Adjustments

Dosage modifications are not typically required based on renal or hepatic function.  However, co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampicin) may decrease gemigliptin exposure, while strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) may increase exposure.

## Side Effects

### Common Side Effects

*   Nasopharyngitis
*   Headache
*   Upper respiratory tract infection

### Rare but Serious Side Effects

*   Pancreatitis
*   Angioedema
*   Severe and disabling arthralgia
*   Bullous pemphigoid

### Long-Term Effects

Long-term effects are still being evaluated, but some studies have reported an increased incidence of hospitalization for heart failure.


### Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)

Clinically significant ADRs include pancreatitis, hypersensitivity reactions, bullous pemphigoid, and severe arthralgia.

## Contraindications

*   Hypersensitivity to gemigliptin
*   Type 1 diabetes mellitus
*   Diabetic ketoacidosis


## Drug Interactions

*   **CYP3A4 inducers:** May decrease gemigliptin concentrations.
*   **CYP3A4 inhibitors:** May increase gemigliptin concentrations.
*   **Sulfonylureas:** Increased risk of hypoglycemia.



## Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

The safety of gemigliptin during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been established.  It should be avoided unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus or infant.



## Drug Profile Summary

*   **Mechanism of Action:** DPP-4 inhibitor, increases incretin hormone levels.
*   **Side Effects:** Nasopharyngitis, headache, upper respiratory tract infections, pancreatitis, angioedema.
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, type 1 diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis.
*   **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors, sulfonylureas.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid unless benefits outweigh risks.
*   **Dosage:** 50 mg orally once daily.
*   **Monitoring Parameters:** HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, postprandial glucose.

## Popular Combinations

*   Metformin
*   Metformin + Sulfonylurea

These combinations provide synergistic effects in improving glycemic control.


## Precautions

*   Assess renal function prior to initiation.
*   Monitor for signs of pancreatitis, hypersensitivity, or bullous pemphigoid.
*   Caution in elderly patients and those with hepatic impairment.
