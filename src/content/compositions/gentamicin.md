## **Usage**

Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic prescribed for serious bacterial infections.  It is effective against a wide range of gram-negative bacteria, including *Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus species, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter*, and *Serratia*.  It also has activity against some gram-positive bacteria, including *Staphylococcus aureus* (including methicillin-resistant strains).

**Pharmacological Classification:** Aminoglycoside antibiotic.

**Mechanism of Action:** Gentamicin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by irreversibly binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, leading to misreading of mRNA and ultimately cell death.


## **Alternate Names**

Gentamicin sulfate.

**Brand Names:** Garamycin, G-mycetin, and others.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Gentamicin exerts a concentration-dependent bactericidal effect. Higher concentrations achieve greater bacterial killing. Post-antibiotic effect is observed, meaning bacterial growth remains suppressed even after serum concentrations fall below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:** Poorly absorbed orally; administered parenterally (IV, IM).  
* **Distribution:** Widely distributed in extracellular fluid; low penetration into cerebrospinal fluid, ocular tissues, and bone. Does not readily cross the placental barrier but is found in breast milk.
* **Metabolism:**  Not significantly metabolized.
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted unchanged by glomerular filtration.

**Mode of Action:** Gentamicin binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria. This binding interferes with the initiation of protein synthesis, causes misreading of mRNA, and leads to the production of non-functional proteins.  This disruption of protein synthesis ultimately results in bacterial cell death. Gentamicin's action is primarily bactericidal.

**Elimination pathways:** Renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  1.5 mg/kg every 8 hours or 5-7 mg/kg once daily (extended-interval dosing), administered IV or IM.

#### **Children:** Dosing varies depending on age:
* **Neonates (0-7 days):** 2.5-4 mg/kg every 12-24 hours
* **Infants and children (1 month to 12 years):** 2-2.5 mg/kg every 8 hours or 4-7 mg/kg/day, once daily.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments based on renal function are essential.  
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduced dosage and extended dosing intervals based on creatinine clearance (CrCl). Monitor serum gentamicin levels.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Usually no dose adjustment is required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific adjustments are mentioned other than renal dysfunction.

### **Clinical Use Cases:**

Dosing adjustments are based on serum levels and the infection's severity. Extended-interval dosing is preferred in most cases.  For specific clinical use cases: consult an infectious disease specialist or refer to local guidelines.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Monitor serum gentamicin levels, especially in patients with renal impairment, to ensure therapeutic levels and minimize toxicity.  Nomograms or individualized pharmacokinetic monitoring can guide dose adjustments.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
* Pain or irritation at the injection site.
* Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
* **Nephrotoxicity:** Renal damage can occur, especially with high doses or prolonged treatment.
* **Ototoxicity:** Both auditory (hearing loss) and vestibular (balance problems, vertigo) toxicity are possible, especially with pre-existing renal impairment.
* **Neuromuscular Blockade:**  Rarely, respiratory paralysis can occur, especially when given with neuromuscular blocking agents.

### **Long-Term Effects:**  Ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity can be irreversible with prolonged or high-dose gentamicin therapy.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** As above.


## **Contraindications**
* Hypersensitivity to gentamicin or other aminoglycosides.
* Myasthenia gravis (relative contraindication).
* Pre-existing hearing loss or vestibular dysfunction (relative contraindication).

## **Drug Interactions**
* **Nephrotoxic drugs:** Concurrent use with other nephrotoxic agents (e.g., amphotericin B, vancomycin, NSAIDs) increases the risk of renal damage.
* **Ototoxic drugs:** Concurrent use with other ototoxic drugs (e.g., loop diuretics) increases the risk of hearing loss or balance problems.
* **Neuromuscular blocking agents:**  Gentamicin can potentiate the effects of these agents, increasing the risk of respiratory paralysis.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
* **Pregnancy:** Gentamicin crosses the placenta and can cause fetal harm (ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity).  Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus. Pregnancy category C or D (source dependent).
* **Breastfeeding:** Gentamicin is excreted in breast milk in low concentrations. Monitor the infant for diarrhea, thrush, and other signs of gastrointestinal disturbance.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit.
* **Side Effects:** Nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, neuromuscular blockade.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to aminoglycosides, myasthenia gravis.
* **Drug Interactions:** Nephrotoxic and ototoxic drugs, neuromuscular blocking agents.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution in pregnancy (Category C/D); monitor infants for adverse GI effects during breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 1.5 mg/kg q8h or 5-7 mg/kg q24h; Children: dose varies with age.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Serum gentamicin levels, renal function (serum creatinine, urine output), hearing and balance.

## **Popular Combinations**
Gentamicin is often used in combination with beta-lactam antibiotics (e.g., penicillin, ampicillin) for synergistic effects against gram-negative bacteria, especially for serious infections like sepsis or endocarditis.


## **Precautions**
* **General Precautions:** Renal function monitoring.  Hearing and balance assessments. Monitor serum gentamicin levels.
* **Specific Populations:** As detailed in earlier sections.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** No specific lifestyle modifications are mentioned.
