## **Usage**

Gestodene is primarily used in combination with ethinylestradiol as a combined oral contraceptive (COC) to prevent pregnancy.  It belongs to the pharmacological classification of progestins, specifically a third-generation synthetic progestogen.  Gestodene, in combination with ethinylestradiol, primarily works by inhibiting ovulation.  It also alters the cervical mucus, making it thicker and less penetrable by sperm, and changes the uterine lining, making implantation less likely.

## **Alternate Names**

Gestodene is the generic name. Brand names vary depending on the specific formulation and country but may include Minesse®, Femodene®, Minulet®, Harmonet®, and Millinette®.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Gestodene, in combination with ethinylestradiol, suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, inhibiting the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH).  This prevents follicular development and ovulation. Gestodene also induces changes in the cervical mucus, increasing its viscosity, thus hindering sperm penetration.  Additionally, it alters the endometrium, making it less receptive to implantation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Gestodene is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations are reached in about 1 hour. The plasma concentrations are dependent on sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, which are increased by ethinylestradiol.
* **Distribution:** Gestodene is highly bound to plasma proteins, primarily SHBG (50-70%) and albumin (30%). It has an apparent volume of distribution of about 1.4 L/kg.
* **Metabolism:**  Gestodene is extensively metabolized in the liver via the steroid metabolic pathway, primarily by CYP3A4 enzymes.  It undergoes hydroxylation and reduction reactions.
* **Elimination:** Gestodene metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine and to a lesser extent in the feces. Less than 1% is excreted unchanged in urine.

**Mode of Action:** Gestodene binds to and activates progesterone receptors. It has a high affinity for these receptors, making it a very potent progestin. Although it has weak androgenic, antimineralocorticoid, and glucocorticoid activity, these effects are generally not clinically significant at the doses used in COCs.

## **Dosage**

The dosage of gestodene is always in combination with ethinylestradiol and is dependent on the specific formulation.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The typical dose is one tablet containing 60 mcg gestodene and 15-30 mcg ethinylestradiol daily for 21 days, followed by a 7-day pill-free interval (during which withdrawal bleeding usually occurs), or 24 active pills followed by 4 placebo pills.

#### **Children:**

COCs containing gestodene are generally not indicated for use before menarche.  After menarche, the dosage is the same as for adults.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** COCs are generally not recommended for postmenopausal women.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Data is limited, and caution should be exercised in these patients.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** COCs are contraindicated in women with severe hepatic impairment. Caution is advised in those with mild to moderate impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or a history of thromboembolic events.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Gestodene-containing COCs are not indicated for use in the clinical settings listed (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations).  Their sole indication is contraception.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with hepatic impairment, or those taking medications that interact with gestodene metabolism (e.g., enzyme inducers or inhibitors).

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, headache, breast tenderness, breakthrough bleeding, mood changes, weight changes, and fluid retention.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), arterial thromboembolism (ATE), such as myocardial infarction and stroke, hepatic adenoma, and gallbladder disease.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Increased risk of certain cancers (breast, cervical) with long-term use, although the overall risk remains low.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), cholestatic jaundice, and elevated liver enzymes.

## **Contraindications**

Pregnancy, history of VTE or ATE, severe hepatic impairment, known or suspected breast cancer, undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding, and hypersensitivity to gestodene or ethinylestradiol.

## **Drug Interactions**

Enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John's Wort) can decrease the effectiveness of gestodene.  Certain anti-HIV medications and antifungals can also interact. Gestodene can increase the levels of some medications, such as cyclosporine.  Alcohol, grapefruit juice, and some foods high in fat may affect absorption.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Gestodene-containing COCs are contraindicated during pregnancy.  They are not recommended during breastfeeding as they may reduce milk production and pass into breast milk, although the effects on the infant are generally considered minimal.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits ovulation, thickens cervical mucus, alters endometrium.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, headache, breast tenderness, breakthrough bleeding, VTE, ATE.
* **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, history of VTE/ATE, severe hepatic disease, breast cancer.
* **Drug Interactions:** Enzyme inducers, certain anti-HIV medications, antifungals.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy, not recommended during breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** One tablet daily, specific dose depending on formulation.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, liver function tests, signs of VTE/ATE.

## **Popular Combinations**

Gestodene is typically combined with ethinylestradiol in various COC formulations.

## **Precautions**

Assess for risk factors for VTE, ATE, and liver disease.  Monitor blood pressure and liver function. Counseling on lifestyle factors (smoking, obesity) is important.
