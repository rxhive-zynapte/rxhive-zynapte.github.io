      What is the most serious side effect of Gilteritinib?**

      **A:** Differentiation syndrome is a serious and potentially fatal side
      effect. It's characterized by fever, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates,
      pleural or pericardial effusions and requires prompt treatment with
      corticosteroids and hemodynamic monitoring. Other serious side effects
      include QTc interval prolongation, PRES, pancreatitis, severe

  - q: >-
      How does Gilteritinib work?**

      **A:** Gilteritinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It primarily targets
      FLT3, a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a key role in AML development
      and progression, especially when mutated.  It also inhibits AXL, a
      receptor tyrosine kinase implicated in resistance. By inhibiting these
      kinases, gilteritinib disrupts signaling pathways crucial for cell growth,
      proliferation, and survival in leukemic cells.

## **Usage**

- Gilteritinib is prescribed for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) harboring an FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutation.  Relapsed AML means AML that has returned after treatment. Refractory AML means AML that did not respond to prior treatment.  FLT3 mutations are genetic changes to this gene that are frequently implicated in AML.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Kinase inhibitor, more specifically a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets FLT3.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Gilteritinib inhibits FLT3, a receptor tyrosine kinase.  FLT3 mutations are common drivers in AML, promoting uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. Gilteritinib inhibits the activity of mutated FLT3, thus suppressing the proliferation and survival of leukemic cells.  It also inhibits AXL, a receptor tyrosine kinase associated with acquired resistance to FLT3 inhibitors, thus enhancing the response rate in patients harboring AXL mutations.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Gilteritinib
- **Brand Name:** Xospata

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Gilteritinib primarily targets and inhibits FLT3, leading to decreased signaling in leukemic cells, inducing apoptosis (programmed cell death), and inhibiting proliferation. It also inhibits other tyrosine kinases like AXL, which may contribute to its activity.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Peak plasma concentration is reached 4-6 hours after oral administration.  Administering with food may increase Cmax and AUC of the drug.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver, predominantly by CYP3A4.  
    - **Elimination:** Primarily excreted in the feces (approximately 65%), with a smaller fraction (around 16%) eliminated in the urine as unchanged drug and metabolites.  The elimination half-life is approximately 113 hours (almost 5 days).
- **Mode of Action:** Gilteritinib binds to the ATP-binding pocket of FLT3, inhibiting its tyrosine kinase activity.  This blocks downstream signaling pathways crucial for cell proliferation and survival.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Inhibits FLT3 and other kinases, including AXL, KIT, PDGFRα/β, and VEGFR2.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism through CYP3A4, followed by fecal excretion. Some renal excretion of unchanged drug and metabolites occurs.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 120 mg (three 40 mg tablets) orally once daily, with or without food, at approximately the same time each day. 
-  Do not break, crush, or chew tablets.
- Treatment should continue for at least 6 months or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  If no response is observed after 4 weeks, the dose may be increased to 200 mg once daily if tolerated.

#### **Children:**

- The safety and efficacy of gilteritinib in children below 18 years of age have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients (≥65 years):** No dose adjustment is required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment needed for mild to moderate impairment (Child-Pugh A or B).  Gilteritinib is not recommended for severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution should be exercised in patients with cardiac conditions, particularly long QT syndrome, or electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia).

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary due to adverse events (see Table 1 in source [4] and Table 1 in source [21] or Dosage with Toxicity section of source [21]):

- **Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES):** Discontinue gilteritinib.
- **QTc Interval Prolongation:** 
 - If QTcF >500 msec: Interrupt gilteritinib. Resume at 80 mg daily once QTc interval returns to within 30 msec of baseline or is ≤480 msec.
 - QTcF interval increase >30 msec on Day 8 of Cycle 1: Confirm with repeat ECG on Day 9.  If confirmed, consider dose reduction to 80 mg daily.
- **Pancreatitis:** Interrupt gilteritinib until resolution. Resume at 80 mg daily.
- **Other Grade ≥3 Toxicities:** Interrupt until resolution or improvement to Grade 1. Resume at 80 mg daily.
- **HSCT:** Discontinue one week prior to conditioning. It may be resumed 30 days after if no acute graft-vs-host disease, patient is in CRc and has shown successful engraftment.
