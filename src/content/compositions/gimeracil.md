## **Usage**

Gimeracil is an antineoplastic antimetabolite drug primarily used in combination with other medications, specifically tegafur and oteracil potassium, for the treatment of advanced gastric cancer. It is not typically prescribed on its own.  It belongs to the pharmacological classification of antineoplastic antimetabolites, specifically a dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) inhibitor. Gimeracil enhances the effect of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a chemotherapy drug, by preventing its breakdown by DPD.


## **Alternate Names**

Gimeracil is sometimes referred to as CDHP (its chemical abbreviation). It doesn't have widely recognized international or regional variations.  It is primarily known as a component of combination products, and the combination, rather than gimeracil itself, is usually given a brand name, for example Teysuno (tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil) and TS-1/TS-ONE (tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Gimeracil inhibits DPD, the enzyme responsible for the rapid metabolism and inactivation of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).  By inhibiting DPD, Gimeracil increases 5-FU's bioavailability and prolongs its effects, enabling 5-FU to be more effective at lower doses, thus reducing systemic toxicity to the body. The increase in 5-FU exposure can lead to intensified chemotherapeutic effects against cancer cells.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Gimeracil is administered orally.  The absorption of Gimeracil itself hasn't been extensively studied as it is normally measured as a combined treatment alongside tegafur and oteracil potassium. The primary route of elimination is renal excretion.  In patients with renal impairment, its clearance is reduced, therefore an adjustment to dosage is necessary.

**Mechanism of Action:** Gimeracil acts by competitively and reversibly inhibiting DPD. It has approximately 180 times higher DPD inhibitory activity than uracil. It does not directly interact with DNA or other cellular components like some other antineoplastic agents. Its role is solely to enhance the effects of the co-administered 5-FU.


## **Dosage**

Gimeracil is not administered alone but is given in combination with tegafur and oteracil.  Dosages here reflect common practices but may vary and individual patient factors must be considered.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard recommended dose of Teysuno (tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil) is 25 mg/m² (expressed as tegafur content), taken orally twice daily (morning and evening) for 21 consecutive days, followed by a 7-day rest period. This 28-day cycle is then repeated. Capsules should be taken with water at least one hour before or after a meal. TS-1/TS-ONE dosing depends on body surface area, with dose adjustments as needed.

#### **Children:**

The safety and efficacy of Teysuno/TS-1 have not been established in children under 18 years old, therefore it should not be used in the pediatric population.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients (over 70 years):**  No standard dose adjustment is typically recommended, but caution is advised due to potential age-related decline in organ function. Close monitoring for adverse reactions is crucial.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose reduction is necessary. The recommended standard dose in patients with moderate renal impairment is 20 mg/m² twice daily (expressed as tegafur content). It is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min).
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is typically recommended for mild to moderate hepatic impairment. For severe hepatic impairment, use is generally not recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful evaluation and potential dose adjustments are necessary for patients with other medical conditions, especially those affecting bone marrow function or impacting drug metabolism.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Gimeracil, as a component of Teysuno/TS-1, is specifically indicated for advanced gastric cancer and is not used in clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations outside of its oncology indication.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on individual patient characteristics, including renal function, age, tolerance to the medication, and other comorbidities.  Dose reductions are commonly made during a treatment cycle if toxicity develops.  It's essential to follow clinical guidelines and tailor adjustments to the individual patient.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, fatigue, anorexia, stomatitis, hand-foot syndrome (palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia), bone marrow suppression (neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia), increased lacrimation, dry eye.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Severe bone marrow suppression, acute renal failure, severe hepatic dysfunction (including fulminant hepatitis), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, interstitial pneumonitis, ocular toxicity (blurred vision, diplopia, photopsia, decreased visual acuity, blindness), severe diarrhea, dehydration, electrolyte disturbances.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic complications from prolonged use are possible, including cumulative bone marrow suppression, renal toxicity, and secondary malignancies.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs include severe bone marrow suppression, acute renal failure, hepatotoxicity, severe diarrhea, dehydration, and ocular toxicity, requiring prompt medical intervention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to any of the active substances (tegafur, gimeracil, or oteracil) or any of the excipients.
* History of severe or unexpected reactions to fluoropyrimidine therapy.
* Known DPD deficiency.
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* Severe bone marrow suppression.
* Severe renal impairment (CrCl below 30 mL/min).
* Concomitant use of other fluoropyrimidines.
* Recent treatment (within 4 weeks) with DPD inhibitors (e.g., sorivudine, brivudine).

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Other fluoropyrimidines (e.g., capecitabine, 5-FU, flucytosine):** Increased risk of toxicity.
* **DPD inhibitors (e.g., sorivudine, brivudine):** Increased risk of severe toxicity.
* **Coumarin-derivative anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin):** Increased risk of bleeding.
* **Phenytoin:** Increased serum phenytoin levels.
* **Clozapine:** Increased myelotoxicity and hematologic toxicity.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Gimeracil is contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding.  It is classified as Pregnancy Category X (representing a high risk of fetal harm). It is not known if gimeracil is excreted in breast milk, but due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infant, breastfeeding is contraindicated.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** DPD inhibitor, enhances 5-FU activity.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bone marrow suppression, ocular toxicity.
* **Contraindications:**  Pregnancy, breastfeeding, DPD deficiency, severe renal/bone marrow suppression.
* **Drug Interactions:** Other fluoropyrimidines, DPD inhibitors, warfarin, phenytoin.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
* **Dosage:** See detailed dosage section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Complete blood count (CBC), renal function tests, liver function tests.


## **Popular Combinations**

Gimeracil is most commonly combined with tegafur and oteracil (as Teysuno or TS-1), occasionally cisplatin is also added to this treatment regimen.

## **Precautions**

* Monitor patients closely for bone marrow suppression, renal function, hepatic function, and ocular toxicity.
* Pre-screening for DPD deficiency is crucial.
* Patients with mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment require careful monitoring and possible dose adjustment.
* Consider use of prophylactic antiemetics to manage nausea and vomiting.
