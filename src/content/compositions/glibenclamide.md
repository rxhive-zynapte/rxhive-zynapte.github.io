## **Usage**

- Glibenclamide is prescribed for the treatment of **type 2 diabetes mellitus**, specifically in patients whose blood sugar levels are not adequately controlled by diet and exercise alone.  It is often used as a second-line treatment when metformin is not tolerated or contraindicated, or in combination with metformin when the latter alone is insufficient.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Sulfonylurea, Antidiabetic Agent
- **Mechanism of Action:** Glibenclamide stimulates insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells. It binds to and closes ATP-sensitive potassium channels on the beta-cell membrane, which leads to membrane depolarization and opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels. The influx of calcium ions triggers insulin secretion.  Glibenclamide also increases peripheral insulin sensitivity and reduces hepatic glucose output.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:** Glyburide (primarily used in the US and Canada)
- **Brand Names:** Daonil, Diabeta, Glynase, Micronase. Several combination products with metformin are also available under different brand names.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Glibenclamide's primary effect is to lower blood glucose levels by stimulating insulin release. It improves peripheral glucose utilization and reduces hepatic glucose production.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Glibenclamide is well-absorbed orally.  Taking it with food can enhance absorption.
    - **Metabolism:**  Primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP2C9 to inactive metabolites.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted mainly in the urine and bile.  Dosage adjustments may be required in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency.
- **Mode of Action:** Binds to sulfonylurea receptors (SUR1) on the ATP-sensitive potassium channels of pancreatic beta-cells, inhibiting the channel and leading to insulin release.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**  Inhibits ATP-sensitive potassium channels.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism followed by renal and biliary excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Initial:** 2.5-5 mg orally once daily, taken with the first main meal.
- **Maintenance:** 1.25-20 mg orally once daily or in two divided doses (for doses >10mg). The maximum dose is 20 mg daily. Doses should be titrated upwards based on blood glucose response, typically in increments of 2.5 mg weekly.

#### **Children:**

- Glibenclamide is generally not recommended for children. Safety and efficacy in pediatric populations have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose (1.25 mg/day for non-micronized tablets or 0.75 mg/day for micronized tablets), titrating cautiously due to increased risk of hypoglycemia.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min.  Significant renal impairment is a relative contraindication.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution and at lower doses; avoid use in severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Patients with adrenal or pituitary insufficiency or conditions that increase the risk of hypoglycemia require careful monitoring.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Glibenclamide is specifically indicated for the management of type 2 diabetes.  It is not typically used in the context of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. For such situations, insulin therapy is preferred.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with renal/hepatic impairment, elderly patients, or patients with certain comorbid conditions.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
- Nausea, heartburn, stomach upset, diarrhoea
- Weight gain
- Headache, dizziness, weakness

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Severe hypoglycemia
- Hepatotoxicity (liver damage)
- Blood disorders (thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, agranulocytosis)
- Allergic reactions (skin rash, itching, swelling)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Increased risk of cardiovascular mortality has been suggested in some studies, although evidence is not conclusive.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Severe hypoglycemia requiring medical intervention
- Hepatotoxicity
- Hematological abnormalities

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to glibenclamide, other sulfonylureas, or sulfonamides
- Type 1 diabetes mellitus
- Diabetic ketoacidosis, diabetic coma
- Severe renal or hepatic impairment
- Porphyria
- Concomitant use with bosentan

## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP450 Interactions:** Glibenclamide is metabolized by CYP2C9.  Drugs that inhibit or induce CYP2C9 can alter glibenclamide levels.
- **Other Drug Interactions:**
    - NSAIDs, beta-blockers, alcohol, some antibiotics (e.g., fluoroquinolones, macrolides) can enhance the hypoglycemic effect.
    - Corticosteroids, thiazide diuretics can decrease the hypoglycemic effect.
    - Bosentan increases the risk of hepatotoxicity.
    - Colesevelam can reduce glibenclamide absorption.
- **Food and Lifestyle Factors:**  Alcohol can potentiate the hypoglycemic effect and can cause a disulfiram-like reaction.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Category C (or B by some manufacturers).  Not generally recommended during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester.  Insulin is the preferred agent for managing diabetes during pregnancy.
- **Breastfeeding:** Small amounts of glibenclamide are excreted in breast milk.  Use with caution during breastfeeding.  Monitor the infant for signs of hypoglycemia.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Stimulates insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells.
- **Side Effects:** Hypoglycemia, nausea, weight gain.
- **Contraindications:** Type 1 diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis, severe renal/hepatic impairment.
- **Drug Interactions:**  NSAIDs, beta-blockers, alcohol, bosentan.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; generally avoided in pregnancy.
- **Dosage:** 2.5-20 mg daily.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood glucose levels, HbA1c.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Metformin:  The combination of glibenclamide and metformin is frequently used to achieve better glycemic control when metformin alone is insufficient.

## **Precautions**

- Monitor blood glucose and HbA1c levels regularly.
- Educate patients about the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.
- Patients with G6PD deficiency should not use this drug.
