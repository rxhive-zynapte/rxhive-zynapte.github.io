      sulfonylureas. It also possesses some extra-pancreatic effects, like
      improving peripheral insulin sensitivity.

## **Usage**

- Gliclazide is an oral antidiabetic medication prescribed for the management of **type 2 diabetes mellitus** in adults. It is used when dietary modifications, exercise, and weight loss alone are insufficient to achieve adequate glycemic control.  Gliclazide is **not** indicated for the treatment of **type 1 diabetes**.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Gliclazide belongs to the class of medications known as **sulfonylureas**, specifically the second-generation sulfonylureas.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Gliclazide primarily works by stimulating insulin release from the beta cells of the pancreas.  It achieves this by binding to and closing ATP-sensitive potassium channels on the beta-cell membrane, leading to membrane depolarization and subsequent insulin secretion.

## **Alternate Names**

-  No commonly used alternate names exist for Gliclazide itself. However, it is marketed under various brand names.
- **Brand Names:**  Diamicron, Diamicron MR, Glizide, Gliclazide Krka, Apo-Gliclazide, Zicron. (This list may not be exhaustive and can vary by region).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Gliclazide lowers blood glucose levels by increasing insulin secretion from the pancreas. It also appears to have extra-pancreatic effects, improving peripheral insulin sensitivity and reducing hepatic glucose production.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Gliclazide is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with modified-release formulations offering a more sustained absorption profile.
    - **Metabolism:** It is primarily metabolized in the liver to inactive metabolites.
    - **Elimination:**  Excreted mainly through the kidneys (renal excretion), with a small portion eliminated in the feces.
- **Mode of Action:** Gliclazide binds to specific sulfonylurea receptors (SUR1) on the surface of pancreatic beta cells. This binding inhibits ATP-sensitive potassium channels, leading to depolarization of the beta-cell membrane.  This depolarization opens voltage-gated calcium channels, promoting calcium influx into the beta cells, which triggers insulin release.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Gliclazide's primary action is through receptor binding (SUR1) and subsequent potassium channel blockade.  It does not directly inhibit enzymes or modulate neurotransmitters in its principal antidiabetic action.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Predominantly renal excretion, with some hepatic metabolism contributing to elimination.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Initial Dose:**  For conventional tablets, the initial dose is typically 40-80 mg daily. For modified-release (MR) formulations, it is usually 30 mg daily.
- **Maintenance Dose:** The dose can be titrated upwards in increments based on blood glucose response and HbA1c levels.  The maximum daily dose for conventional tablets is generally 320 mg, while the maximum daily dose for MR formulations is usually 120 mg. Doses above 160 mg/day for conventional tablets should be divided into two doses. MR tablets are taken once daily with breakfast.

#### **Children:**

- Gliclazide is **not recommended for use in children and adolescents**.  Safety and efficacy have not been established in this population.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lowest effective dose (usually 30 mg MR or 40 mg conventional) and titrate cautiously based on renal function and blood glucose monitoring.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** For mild to moderate renal impairment, dosage adjustments may be necessary. For severe renal impairment, Gliclazide is generally contraindicated.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dosage adjustment may be required in patients with hepatic impairment. In severe hepatic dysfunction, Gliclazide is contraindicated.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring and dose adjustments are essential in patients with other medical conditions, particularly cardiovascular disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Gliclazide's use is specifically for the chronic management of type 2 diabetes.  It is **not indicated** for acute settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations such as status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.  Insulin is typically preferred in these acute contexts.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments should be individualized based on the patient's glycemic response, renal function, hepatic function, and other medical conditions.  Close monitoring of blood glucose and HbA1c is essential.

## **Side Effects**
