## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Glycerin is used for treating constipation, reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) before eye surgery or in glaucoma, reducing brain edema associated with conditions like stroke, meningitis, or CNS tumors, and facilitating passage of meconium in newborns. It is also used as a moisturizer for the skin.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Osmotic laxative (rectal), osmotic diuretic (oral), ophthalmic osmotic agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Glycerin works by drawing water into the colon (rectal use), increasing plasma osmolality (oral use), or drawing fluid out of the cornea (ophthalmic use).

## **Alternate Names**

- Glycerol
- Glycerine
- Osmoglyn (brand name)
- Ophthalgan (brand name)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Orally or intravenously, glycerin elevates blood plasma osmolality, creating an osmotic gradient that draws water from tissues into the vascular space. Rectally, it softens stool and stimulates bowel movements. In the eye, it dehydrates the cornea, reducing IOP.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Glycerin is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  It is metabolized primarily in the liver and eliminated by the kidneys.  
- **Mode of Action:** Glycerin exerts its effects through osmotic action. It does not bind to receptors, inhibit enzymes, or modulate neurotransmitters.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion; hepatic metabolism plays a lesser role.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Constipation (rectal):** 2-3 g suppository once daily or 5-15 mL enema once daily.
- **IOP reduction (oral):** 1-2 g/kg one time, 1-1.5 hours before surgery.
- **Cerebral edema (oral/IV):** 0.5 to 2 g/kg every 4 to 6 hours.
- **Cough (oral):** 5-10 mL of a 15% v/v syrup 3-4 times daily.

#### **Children:**

- **Constipation (rectal):** 1-1.7 g suppository (ages 2-6), or 2-2.1g suppository (ages 6 and above) once daily; or 2-5 mL enema (ages 2-6), or 5-15 ml enema (ages 6 and above) once daily.
- **IOP reduction (oral):** 1-1.5 g/kg one time.
- **Cough (oral):**  5 mL of a 15% v/v syrup 3-4 times daily (ages 3 months to 5 years).
- **Meconium passage (rectal):** 0.2 mL of diluted 80% glycerol solution (neonates).
- **Pediatric Safety Considerations:** Adjust doses based on body weight. Rectal glycerin is generally safe for children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start at lower doses due to potential for age-related decline in renal function. 
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustment may be necessary based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use cautiously, as the liver plays a role in glycerol metabolism. 
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient characteristics and comorbidities like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dehydration, and hypervolemia.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation:**  Nitroglycerin, not glycerin, is used in some protocols to attenuate the hemodynamic response to intubation (not glycerol). 0.4 mg (1 spray) to 0.8 mg (2 sprays) one minute before intubation may be administered.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Glycerin can be used preoperatively to reduce IOP before eye surgeries and brain volume before neurosurgical procedures.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not typically used with glycerol.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  Intravenous glycerin may be used for cerebral edema management under close monitoring. 
- **Emergency Situations:** May be used in the emergency department for cerebral edema and acute glaucoma.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments required in renal/hepatic dysfunction, dehydration, and hypervolemia.

## **Side Effects**

- Dizziness
- Nausea
- Vomiting
