      **A:** The dosage varies depending on the indication and route of
      administration.  For constipation, 2-3 g rectally as a suppository or 5-15
      mL as an enema. For elevated IOP or intracranial pressure, 1-2 g/kg
      orally.

## **Usage**

- Glycerol is prescribed for the treatment of occasional constipation, reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) before eye surgery or in acute glaucoma attacks, and as an adjunct in hyperhydration strategies for athletes.  It can also be used to reduce cerebral edema.
- **Pharmacological classification:**  Osmotic laxative, osmotic diuretic, humectant.
- **Mechanism of action:** Glycerol exerts its laxative effect by drawing water into the rectum, softening the stool and promoting bowel movements.  Its diuretic effect stems from its ability to increase the osmolarity of the blood, leading to fluid shifts and increased urination.  The humectant properties of glycerol help retain moisture in skin and mucous membranes, offering topical benefits for dry or irritated skin conditions.

## **Alternate Names**

- Glycerin, glycerine, propane-1,2,3-triol.
- **Brand names:**  Fleet Glycerin Suppositories, Pedia-Lax, Osmoglyn (oral), and various generic preparations.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Orally administered glycerol is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed throughout the body.  It increases blood plasma osmolarity, leading to a shift of fluid from intracellular and interstitial spaces into the vascular compartment.  This effect leads to diuresis and reduced IOP and intracranial pressure. Rectally, glycerol acts as a hyperosmotic laxative, drawing water into the rectum and stimulating peristalsis.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Glycerol is readily absorbed following oral administration. It is metabolized primarily in the liver, and a small amount is excreted unchanged by the kidneys. 
- **Mode of action:** Glycerol's osmotic properties underlie its various effects. It increases the osmotic gradient across cell membranes, drawing water into the compartment where glycerol is present. 
- **Elimination pathways:**  Primarily hepatic metabolism, with a small amount excreted unchanged in the urine.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Constipation (rectal):** 2-3 g as a suppository or 5-15 mL as an enema, once.
- **Elevated IOP/Intracranial pressure (oral):** 1-2 g/kg body weight as a single dose.  Maintenance doses of 500 mg/kg every 6 hours can be used.

#### **Children:**

- **Constipation (rectal):**  2-6 years: 1-1.7 g suppository or 2-5 mL enema. Over 6 years: 2-3 g suppository or 5-15 mL enema.
- **Elevated IOP/Intracranial pressure (oral):** 1-1.5 g/kg as a single dose. May repeat every 4-8 hours if needed.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lower end of the dose range and monitor closely for dehydration.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised, as glycerol can exacerbate dehydration. Dosage adjustment may be required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution and monitor closely. Dosage adjustment may be required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Patients with diabetes may experience hyperglycemia after glycerol administration. Cardiovascular patients should be monitored for fluid overload.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation:**  May be used to reduce intracranial pressure prior to or during intubation.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Glycerol can reduce IOP prior to ophthalmic surgeries.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Use with caution in mechanically ventilated patients due to the risk of fluid overload.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  May be used to reduce intracranial pressure in ICU settings, but close monitoring is crucial.
- **Emergency Situations:** Glycerol may be used in the management of acute glaucoma and cerebral edema.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- Renal or hepatic dysfunction warrants careful consideration of fluid balance and potential need for dose adjustments.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloating, thirst.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
