      What is the recommended dosage for Glycine?**


      **A:**  The dosage of glycine varies depending on the indication. For
      schizophrenia, it can range from 0.4-0.8 g/kg daily. For other indications
      like improving sleep quality, lower doses of 2-5 grams daily may be
      sufficient.

      **A:** High-dose Glycine should be administered under close medical
      supervision with careful monitoring for potential side effects such as
      hyponatremia and cardiovascular instability.  Fluid and electrolyte
      balance should be maintained.  Dosage and administration rate should be
      titrated based on patient response and tolerance.

## **Usage**

- Glycine is prescribed as an adjunct therapy for schizophrenia to help alleviate negative symptoms in patients who don't respond well to conventional antipsychotic medications.  It's also used in urology to improve urine storage symptoms. It has shown promise in protecting against doxorubicin-induced heart toxicity. It may also be used in specific clinical settings like during intubation, surgical procedures, or in the ICU when rapid reductions in core body temperature is required.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Amino acid, neurotransmitter modulator.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Glycine acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, primarily in the brainstem and spinal cord.  It also acts as a co-agonist at NMDA receptors, thereby modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission. This dual action is believed to contribute to its therapeutic effects in schizophrenia.

## **Alternate Names**

- Aminoacetic acid
- Glycol

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Glycine's primary effect is on the central nervous system, where it modulates neuronal excitability. By acting on NMDA receptors, it may enhance cognitive function and reduce negative symptoms in schizophrenia.  Peripherally, glycine contributes to various metabolic processes, including collagen synthesis and detoxification.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Glycine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  It is metabolized primarily in the liver through transamination to serine and deamination to ammonia, which is then converted to urea. Glycine is excreted by the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:**  Glycine acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter by binding to glycine receptors, leading to chloride influx and hyperpolarization of postsynaptic neurons. As an NMDA receptor co-agonist, it facilitates glutamate binding and enhances excitatory neurotransmission.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Glycine is primarily eliminated through renal excretion. A smaller portion is metabolized in the liver.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- For schizophrenia: 0.4-0.8 g/kg daily in divided doses, starting at 4 g daily and increasing by 4 g per day until the effective dose is reached. Daily doses up to 6 grams for up to 4 weeks are generally considered possibly safe.
- For other uses: 2-5 grams daily.

#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy in children have not been established for all uses.  For isovaleric acidemia: 50 mg/kg three times daily. The dose may be increased to a maximum of 250 mg/kg/day during acute episodes.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary based on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is recommended.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution due to potential for hyperammonemia.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular or pulmonary disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:** High doses of glycine (e.g. 0.5 g/kg body weight) may be required for specialized applications such as inducing therapeutic hypothermia or mitigating reperfusion injury, administered either enterally or intravenously.  This is typically done under strict medical supervision in critical care settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**  Adjustments may be necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Mild gastrointestinal upset (e.g., nausea, stomach discomfort).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Hyperammonemia (in patients with hepatic impairment)
- Hyponatremia
- Coma
- Allergic reactions (rare)

## **Contraindications**

- Anuria
- Severe liver or kidney impairment
- Hypersensitivity to glycine

## **Drug Interactions**

- Clozapine: Glycine may reduce the effectiveness of clozapine.
- Aspirin: Contraindicated in patients with isovaleric acidemia receiving glycine.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been established. Avoid use unless clearly needed and under medical supervision.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibitory neurotransmitter, NMDA receptor co-agonist.

- **Drug Interactions:** Clozapine, aspirin.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Avoid use unless clearly necessary under medical supervision.
- **Dosage:** Varies depending on indication and patient factors.
