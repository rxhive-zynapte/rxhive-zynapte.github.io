## **Usage**

Glycopyrronium, also known as glycopyrrolate, is prescribed for the symptomatic treatment of severe sialorrhea (chronic pathological drooling) in children and adolescents aged 3 years and older with chronic neurological disorders. It is also used preoperatively to reduce salivary, tracheobronchial, and pharyngeal secretions; to reduce the volume and free acidity of gastric secretions; and to block cardiac vagal inhibitory reflexes during induction of anesthesia and intubation.  It is also useful intraoperatively to counteract drug-induced or vagal traction reflexes with associated arrhythmias.  Additionally, it can be used as adjunctive therapy in adults for the treatment of peptic ulcer when rapid anticholinergic effect is desired or when oral medication is not tolerated.
It can also be used to treat hyperhidrosis (topically) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (inhalation). Its pharmacological classification is anticholinergic.

Glycopyrronium works by competitively blocking the action of acetylcholine at peripheral muscarinic receptors. This inhibition reduces secretions from exocrine glands like salivary, bronchial, and gastric glands.  It also increases heart rate by blocking vagal effects on the sinoatrial node.



## **Alternate Names**

Glycopyrrolate, Glycopyrronium bromide

Some brand names include: Robinul, Cuvposa, Seebri, Robinul Forte


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Glycopyrronium acts as a competitive antagonist at peripheral muscarinic (M1, M2, and M3) receptors, inhibiting the effects of acetylcholine. This leads to decreased secretions from exocrine glands (salivary, bronchial, gastric), increased heart rate, bronchodilation, mydriasis, and decreased gastrointestinal motility.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is incomplete and variable.  The presence of high-fat food reduces the oral bioavailability.  
* **Distribution:**  Glycopyrronium is a quaternary ammonium compound that does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier.
* **Metabolism:** Limited information suggests minimal hepatic metabolism.
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine, with some biliary excretion.  Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with renal impairment.

**Mode of Action:** Binds competitively to muscarinic receptors, preventing acetylcholine from binding and exerting its effects.

**Receptor binding:** Muscarinic (M1, M2, M3) receptor antagonist.

**Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of unchanged drug, some biliary excretion.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral:**  For peptic ulcer: 1-2 mg three times a day. Maximum: 8 mg/day.
* **Intravenous/Intramuscular:** Pre-anesthesia: 0.2-0.4 mg or 0.004-0.005 mg/kg (up to 0.4 mg). Intraoperative: 0.1 mg every 2-3 minutes as needed. For COPD: 50 mcg once daily via inhaler.
* **Topical:** For hyperhidrosis:  0.05% solution applied to affected area before iontophoretic treatment.

#### **Children:**

* **Oral (Sialorrhea):** For children ≥3 years: Initial dose of 0.02 mg/kg three times a day. Titrate in increments of 0.02 mg/kg every 5-7 days, up to a maximum of 0.1 mg/kg three times a day, not to exceed 1.5-3 mg per dose.
* **Intravenous/Intramuscular:** 0.004-0.008 mg/kg (up to 0.2 mg) before induction of anesthesia.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Caution is advised; start at the lower end of the dosing range and titrate cautiously.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary. Contraindicated in severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73m²).
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific dosage adjustments provided, but caution is recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease (acute myocardial infarction, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, cardiac insufficiency, coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias), gastrointestinal disorders (gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, ulcerative colitis, pre-existing constipation, or diarrhea), and respiratory conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Intubation:** 0.2-0.4 mg IV/IM before induction.
* **Surgical Procedures:** 0.2-0.4 mg IV/IM preoperatively.  Intraoperatively as needed (0.1 mg every 2-3 minutes)
* **Mechanical Ventilation:**  Can be used to reduce secretions.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** As indicated for management of secretions or bradycardia.
* **Emergency Situations:**  Can be used for bradycardia associated with vagal reflexes.

### **Dosage Adjustments:** Adjust based on patient response and tolerability, renal function, and comorbid conditions.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary hesitancy, drowsiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), acute angle-closure glaucoma, urinary retention, paralytic ileus, confusion, hallucinations, tachycardia, arrhythmias.

### **Long-Term Effects**

See source [2] and [18] for a more detailed list of drug interactions.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category: B (Australian classification)

Limited human data available. Animal studies inadequate to assess reproductive toxicity. Use only if clearly needed.

Glycopyrronium is excreted in breast milk in small amounts. Consider the benefits of breastfeeding versus potential risks to the infant. Discontinue breastfeeding or drug, taking into account risks and benefits.
