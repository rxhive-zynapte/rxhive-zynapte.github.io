## **Usage**

Golimumab is prescribed for the treatment of various inflammatory conditions, including:

* **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA):**  In combination with methotrexate, for moderately to severely active RA in adults.
* **Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA):** For active PsA in adults and children 2 years and older.
* **Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS):** For active AS in adults.
* **Ulcerative Colitis (UC):** For moderately to severely active UC in adults.
* **Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (pJIA):**  For children with a body weight of at least 40kg.



**Pharmacological Classification:**  Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitor;  Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD); Biologic.

**Mechanism of Action:** Golimumab is a human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to both soluble and transmembrane TNF-α, thereby neutralizing its activity. This reduces inflammation and other symptoms associated with the aforementioned diseases.

## **Alternate Names**

Golimumab is also known internationally by the same generic name.

**Brand Names:** Simponi, Simponi Aria


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** By neutralizing TNF-α, golimumab disrupts the inflammatory cascade, leading to a reduction in inflammatory markers and improvement in clinical symptoms such as pain, swelling, and stiffness.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:** Following subcutaneous administration, absorption is relatively slow, with peak serum concentrations occurring in approximately 5-7 days.  Intravenous administration achieves immediate serum levels.
* **Distribution:** Distributes throughout the body, with moderate tissue penetration.
* **Metabolism:**  As a monoclonal antibody, metabolism is expected to be similar to endogenous IgG, involving degradation into small peptides and amino acids.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through proteolytic catabolism; renal elimination plays a minor role.  The half-life of golimumab is approximately 2-3 weeks.

**Mode of Action:** Golimumab binds specifically to TNF-α, preventing it from interacting with its receptors (TNFR1 and TNFR2) on cell surfaces. This inhibition blocks the downstream signaling pathways responsible for inflammation, cell proliferation, and joint destruction.

**Receptor binding:** Binds to both soluble and transmembrane TNF-α.

**Elimination pathways:** Primarily via proteolytic degradation;  minimal renal excretion.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **RA, PsA, AS (Subcutaneous):** 50 mg once monthly. Patients weighing >100 kg may receive 100 mg monthly.
* **RA, PsA, AS (Intravenous - Simponi Aria):** 2 mg/kg IV infusion over 30 minutes at weeks 0 and 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter.  For patients with RA, should be given in combination with methotrexate.
* **UC (Subcutaneous):** 200 mg at week 0, 100 mg at week 2, followed by 100 mg every 4 weeks.

#### **Children:**

* **pJIA, PsA (Intravenous - Simponi Aria):** 80 mg/m² IV infusion over 30 minutes at weeks 0 and 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter.
* **pJIA (Subcutaneous):** 50mg once a month, on the same date each month, for children weighing at least 40 kg.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is generally required, but monitor for infections.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustments are recommended, but monitor closely.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments are recommended, but monitor closely.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with chronic infections, heart failure, or demyelinating diseases.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Golimumab is not typically indicated for acute medical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its use is primarily focused on chronic inflammatory disease management.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient response and tolerability. Monitor patients for efficacy and side effects.  No specific adjustments are provided for renal/hepatic impairment.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Upper respiratory tract infections, injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling), viral infections, headache, and abdominal pain.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Serious infections (e.g., tuberculosis, invasive fungal infections), malignancies (e.g., lymphoma, skin cancer), heart failure, demyelinating disorders, lupus-like syndrome, hepatitis B reactivation, and severe allergic reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Increased risk of infections and malignancies with prolonged use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis),  drug-induced lupus, new or worsening heart failure, and reactivation of hepatitis B.

## **Contraindications**

Active tuberculosis or other severe infections (e.g., sepsis, opportunistic infections); moderate or severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV); known hypersensitivity to golimumab.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Biologic DMARDs and JAK inhibitors:** Avoid concomitant use.
* **Live vaccines:** Not recommended during treatment.
* **Therapeutic infectious agents:**  Avoid concurrent use.
* **Methotrexate:** Concomitant use may increase golimumab levels, but dose adjustments are generally not required.
* **CYP450 interactions:** TNF-α inhibition can affect CYP450 activity.
* Consult a drug interaction checker for a comprehensive list.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Golimumab crosses the placenta, especially during the third trimester, posing a potential risk of infection to the newborn. Use only if clearly needed. Live vaccines are not recommended for infants exposed to golimumab in utero for 6 months after birth.
* **Breastfeeding:** Golimumab is present in breast milk at low concentrations.  Use with caution, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. Shared decision-making with the mother regarding breastfeeding or continuing golimumab should be undertaken.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** TNF-α inhibitor.
* **Side Effects:** Infections, injection site reactions, malignancies, heart failure, demyelinating disorders.
* **Contraindications:** Active serious infections, moderate to severe heart failure.
* **Drug Interactions:** Biologics, live vaccines, therapeutic infectious agents.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; potential risks to fetus and infant.
* **Dosage:** Variable based on indication and route of administration. See dosage section for details.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Signs of infection, complete blood counts, liver function tests, and monitoring for malignancies.


## **Popular Combinations**

* **Methotrexate:** Commonly used with golimumab in RA, PsA, and AS to enhance efficacy.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Screen for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B before starting treatment. Monitor closely for infections during therapy.
* **Specific Populations:**  See Pregnancy and Breastfeeding section.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Patients should be advised on infection prevention strategies.
