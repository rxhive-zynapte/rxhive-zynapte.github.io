## Usage

Gonadotropins are prescribed for the treatment of infertility in both men and women. In women, they are primarily used for ovulation induction in conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), and for controlled ovarian stimulation in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) like in-vitro fertilization (IVF). In men, they are used to treat hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which can cause low sperm production.  

These medications are classified as **gonadotropins** and **ovulation stimulators**.

Gonadotropins mimic the action of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), stimulating the ovaries to develop follicles and produce eggs in women, and stimulating the testes to produce sperm in men.

## Alternate Names

Gonadotropins are often referred to as ovulation stimulants. Brand names of gonadotropins include Gonal-f, Gonal-f RFF (follitropin alfa), Ovidrel, Novarel (choriogonadotropin alfa), and others.


## How It Works

**Pharmacodynamics:** Gonadotropins bind to receptors in the gonads (ovaries and testes), mimicking the effects of FSH and LH. This leads to follicular development, oocyte maturation, and estrogen production in women, and spermatogenesis in men. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is often used to trigger final oocyte maturation and ovulation.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Gonadotropins are generally administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Absorption and distribution vary depending on the specific preparation. Metabolism and elimination pathways are not fully characterized, but a significant portion is likely excreted renally.

**Mode of action:** Gonadotropins interact with specific receptors on the surface of ovarian granulosa cells (FSH) and theca cells (LH), activating intracellular signaling pathways that promote follicular development, estrogen production, and oocyte maturation. hCG mimics LH's action, triggering ovulation.

**Receptor Binding:**  Gonadotropins bind to their respective gonadotropin receptors (FSH receptor and LH/hCG receptor) on the surface of gonadal cells.

## Dosage

### Standard Dosage

#### Adults:

* **Ovulation induction:** Initial dose is typically 75 IU daily, adjusted based on ovarian response, monitored via ultrasound and serum estradiol levels. Maximum dose is generally 300 IU daily.
* **ART:** Starting dose is typically 150-225 IU daily, adjusted based on ovarian response. Maximum dose is generally 450 IU daily.
* **Male hypogonadotropic hypogonadism:** Various regimens exist, often involving hCG and FSH, dosed multiple times per week.

#### Children:

Gonadotropins are not typically used in children except in specific cases like cryptorchidism, where hCG may be used. Dosing is weight-based and requires specialist guidance.

#### Special Cases:

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be needed based on ovarian reserve.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised, but specific dose adjustments are not typically necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Specific dose adjustments are not usually required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with PCOS due to the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).

### Clinical Use Cases

The dosage guidelines provided above encompass the clinical use cases for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not relevant for gonadotropins.

### Dosage Adjustments

Dose adjustments are based primarily on ovarian response as assessed by ultrasound and estradiol levels.

## Side Effects

### Common Side Effects

* Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)
* Injection site reactions
* Headache
* Abdominal pain and bloating
* Mood swings

### Rare but Serious Side Effects

* Severe OHSS (can be life-threatening)
* Multiple pregnancies
* Thromboembolism

### Long-Term Effects

Long-term effects are rare, but prolonged use may increase the risk of ovarian tumors.

### Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)

Severe OHSS requires immediate medical attention.

## Contraindications

* Pituitary tumors
* Ovarian cysts or enlargement unrelated to PCOS
* Prior ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)
* Unexplained vaginal bleeding
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding
* Hormone-dependent cancers

## Drug Interactions

Clinically significant drug interactions are not well established.

## Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Gonadotropins are contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding.


## Drug Profile Summary

* **Mechanism of Action:** Stimulates follicular development and maturation in the ovaries and spermatogenesis in the testes.
* **Side Effects:**  OHSS, injection site reactions, headache, abdominal pain, mood swings.
* **Contraindications:** Pituitary tumors, ovarian cysts, prior OHSS, vaginal bleeding, pregnancy, breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** Limited clinically significant interactions.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
* **Dosage:** Varies based on indication and patient response. See detailed section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Ultrasound, estradiol levels, follicular development.

## Popular Combinations

Gonadotropins are often used in combination with hCG to trigger ovulation.


## Precautions

* Careful monitoring of ovarian response is crucial.
* Patients with PCOS are at increased risk of OHSS.
* Multiple pregnancies are a risk.
