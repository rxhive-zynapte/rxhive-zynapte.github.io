## **Usage**

- Grape seed extract is primarily used for its antioxidant properties and potential benefits in conditions like chronic venous insufficiency, high blood pressure, and diabetic retinopathy.  It's also been explored for its potential role in improving cognitive function and promoting wound healing.
- **Pharmacological Classification**:  Primarily classified as an antioxidant and venotonic agent.  It also exhibits some anti-inflammatory and free radical scavenging properties.
- **Mechanism of Action**: Grape seed extract is rich in proanthocyanidins, which are potent antioxidants. These compounds scavenge free radicals, protect blood vessels, and may improve blood flow.

## **Alternate Names**

- *Vitis vinifera* (scientific name of the common grape vine) seed extract
- Proanthocyanidin extract
- OPCs (Oligomeric Proanthocyanidins)
- **Brand names**: Vary widely depending on the manufacturer.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**:  Grape seed extract's primary effect is through its antioxidant action. Proanthocyanidins protect against oxidative stress by neutralizing free radicals.  This can benefit vascular health, reduce inflammation, and potentially protect against cellular damage.
- **Pharmacokinetics**:
    - **Absorption**: Oral absorption is relatively good.
    - **Metabolism**:  The metabolism of proanthocyanidins is complex and not fully understood.
    - **Elimination**: Excreted primarily through urine and feces.
- **Mode of Action**: Proanthocyanidins, particularly the dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric forms, exhibit potent antioxidant activity by scavenging free radicals. They may also inhibit certain enzymes involved in inflammation and vascular dysfunction.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation**: Specific receptor binding or neurotransmitter modulation has not been clearly identified for grape seed extract's main components.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 100-300 mg daily for general antioxidant support.  Doses up to 600 mg have been used in some studies.  Dosages may vary based on the specific formulation and indication.
