## **Usage**

Green tea extract is primarily used for its potential health benefits derived from its rich antioxidant content, particularly polyphenols like epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). It's often used to support weight management, blood sugar regulation, cardiovascular health, cognitive function, and as an adjunct in disease prevention.  While not strictly a drug, it's pharmacologically classified as a stimulant due to its caffeine content, and also possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and potential anticarcinogenic properties.  Its mechanism of action involves scavenging free radicals, modulating various signaling pathways, and influencing metabolism.

## **Alternate Names**

- Green tea
- Chinese tea
- Japanese tea
- Camellia sinensis (botanical name)
- GTE (abbreviation)


Some brand names include:
- Dexatrim (reformulated)
- SOLAL

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Green tea extract exerts its effects primarily through its polyphenol components, especially EGCG. EGCG acts as a potent antioxidant, scavenging free radicals and protecting cells from oxidative damage.  It also modulates various signaling pathways involved in inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis.  The caffeine content contributes to its stimulant effects, increasing alertness and energy expenditure.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Green tea extract is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, with peak plasma concentrations of EGCG reached within 1-2 hours after ingestion. EGCG is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily through glucuronidation, sulfation, and methylation pathways. It's eliminated primarily through the kidneys, with a half-life of approximately 3-5 hours. Caffeine follows a similar metabolic pathway, with hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.

**Mode of Action:** EGCG's antioxidant activity involves direct scavenging of free radicals, as well as modulating the activity of antioxidant enzymes.  It also influences cell signaling pathways related to inflammation, insulin sensitivity, and lipid metabolism.  EGCG is known to inhibit certain enzymes, such as catechol-O-methyltransferase and fatty acid synthase, which may contribute to its metabolic effects.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** EGCG interacts with numerous cellular targets, including various receptors and enzymes. It can bind to and modulate the activity of receptors involved in inflammation and cell proliferation. It inhibits enzymes involved in lipid synthesis, glucose metabolism, and carcinogenesis.

**Elimination Pathways:** Green tea extract components are primarily eliminated through the kidneys following hepatic metabolism.  Both EGCG and caffeine undergo phase II metabolism (glucuronidation, sulfation, methylation) in the liver before being excreted in the urine.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
A typical dosage range for green tea extract supplements is 250-500 mg per day, often standardized to EGCG content. This can be taken as a single dose or divided doses with food.  Consuming 3-5 cups of green tea daily provides comparable benefits. It's crucial to avoid exceeding recommended dosages due to the risk of liver toxicity.

#### **Children:**
There is no established standard dosage for children. Use in children should be approached with caution and only under the guidance of a healthcare professional.  Potential liver damage is a concern, and caffeine intake should be carefully monitored.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:**  Start with a lower dose and monitor for potential adverse effects, particularly those related to caffeine sensitivity.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary depending on the degree of renal dysfunction.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with extreme caution due to the risk of liver toxicity. Monitoring liver function is essential.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Patients with anxiety disorders, bleeding disorders, diabetes, glaucoma, heart conditions, high blood pressure, and irritable bowel syndrome should use with caution and under medical supervision.  Dosage adjustments may be required.

### **Clinical Use Cases**
Green tea extract is not typically used in acute medical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary applications are for long-term health support and disease prevention.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are required for patients with renal or hepatic impairment and for individuals sensitive to caffeine. Patients with specific medical conditions require careful consideration and potential dosage modifications.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
- Nausea
- Diarrhea
- Upset stomach
- Headache
- Dizziness
- Insomnia
- Irritability


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Liver damage (jaundice, dark urine, abdominal pain)
- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
- Irregular heartbeat
- Seizures

### **Long-Term Effects**
- Potential for liver damage with chronic high-dose use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
- Liver injury (hepatotoxicity) requiring immediate discontinuation and medical attention.
- Severe allergic reactions necessitating prompt medical intervention.

## **Contraindications**
- Hypersensitivity to green tea or its components.
- Severe liver disease.
- Bleeding disorders.
- Pregnancy (high doses).

## **Drug Interactions**

- **Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin):** Green tea contains vitamin K, which can counteract the effects of blood thinners.
- **Stimulants (e.g., ephedrine, nicotine):** Combining with other stimulants can lead to excessive cardiovascular stimulation.
- **Certain medications (e.g., nadolol, atorvastatin, lisinopril):** Green tea can affect the absorption or metabolism of some drugs.
- **Alcohol:**  May increase the risk of liver damage.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
- **Pregnancy:** Moderate green tea consumption (up to 6 cups/day or 300 mg caffeine) is generally considered safe during pregnancy. Higher doses may increase the risk of miscarriage and birth defects.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Moderate caffeine intake from green tea is generally acceptable during breastfeeding, but excessive caffeine can cause irritability and sleep disturbances in infants.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
- **Mechanism of Action:** Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, stimulant.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, diarrhea, headache, insomnia, liver damage (rare).
- **Contraindications:** Liver disease, bleeding disorders, hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, stimulants, certain medications.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Moderate consumption generally safe, avoid high doses.
- **Dosage:** 250-500 mg/day or 3-5 cups of tea.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests (with high doses).


## **Popular Combinations**
Green tea extract is sometimes combined with other ingredients in supplements, such as L-theanine (for cognitive function) or other antioxidants.


## **Precautions**

- Avoid high doses (greater than 800 mg EGCG/day) due to liver toxicity risk.
- Patients with underlying medical conditions should consult a physician before use.
- Monitor caffeine intake, especially in children and individuals sensitive to caffeine.
- Discontinue use if experiencing adverse effects.
