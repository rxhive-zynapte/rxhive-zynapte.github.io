      ## Norethisterone (Primolut N)


      ## Usage

      * Dysfunctional uterine bleeding

      * Endometriosis

      * Premenstrual syndrome

      * Postponement of menstruation

      * Primary and secondary amenorrhea


      **Pharmacological classification:** Progestogen


      **Mechanism of Action:**  Norethisterone transforms proliferative
      endometrium into secretory endometrium. It inhibits the secretion of
      gonadotropins, thereby suppressing ovulation in some cases.



      ## Alternate Names

      Norethindrone, Primolut N


      ## How It Works

      **Pharmacodynamics:**  Norethisterone binds to progesterone receptors in
      the uterus, inducing secretory changes in the endometrium. It can also
      have systemic effects, suppressing gonadotropin release.


      **Pharmacokinetics:**

      * **Absorption:** Well absorbed orally.

      * **Metabolism:** Hepatic metabolism, via CYP enzymes.

      * **Elimination:** Renal and biliary excretion.

This section discusses two common gynaecological products: Misoprostol and Norethisterone (Primolut N).

## Misoprostol

## Usage
Misoprostol is prescribed for various obstetric and gynaecological conditions, including:

* **Inducing labor:**  Used to ripen the cervix and induce labor.
* **Medical abortion:** In combination with mifepristone, or alone where mifepristone is unavailable.
* **Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) prevention and treatment:** To contract the uterus and reduce bleeding after childbirth.
* **Missed or incomplete miscarriage management:** To expel the pregnancy tissue.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Prostaglandin E1 analog.

**Mechanism of Action:** Misoprostol binds to prostaglandin E1 receptors, causing uterine contractions and cervical ripening.


## Alternate Names
Cytotec

## How It Works
**Pharmacodynamics:** Misoprostol stimulates uterine contractions by binding to myometrial prostaglandin E1 receptors.  It also softens and dilates the cervix.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:** Rapidly absorbed orally and vaginally.
* **Metabolism:**  Metabolized in the liver to misoprostol acid, its active metabolite.
* **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion.

**Mode of Action:** Binds to prostaglandin E1 receptors in the myometrium and cervix.

**Elimination Pathways:** Renal excretion.

## Dosage

### Standard Dosage

#### Adults:
Dosage varies greatly depending on the indication and route of administration.  Consult updated guidelines from organizations like FIGO and WHO for specific recommendations.  For example, in PPH prevention, 10 IU of oxytocin (IM/IV) is recommended, with misoprostol as an alternative where oxytocin is unavailable.

#### Children:
Not typically used in children.

#### Special Cases:
No specific adjustments mentioned in the source, though individual patient factors should always be considered.

### Clinical Use Cases
* **Intubation:** Not applicable.
* **Surgical Procedures:**  May be used for cervical ripening before surgical procedures.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not applicable.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  May be used for PPH management.
* **Emergency Situations:** PPH.

### Dosage Adjustments
Adjustments are based on indication, gestational age (if applicable), and route of administration.

## Side Effects

### Common Side Effects
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, fever, chills.

### Rare but Serious Side Effects
Uterine rupture, excessive bleeding.

### Long-Term Effects
Not typically applicable due to short-term use.

Uterine rupture, severe bleeding.

## Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to prostaglandins, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, ectopic pregnancy (for labor induction or abortion).

## Drug Interactions
NSAIDs may reduce the efficacy of misoprostol.
