      **A:** Haloperidol should be used in pregnancy only if the benefit clearly

      during breastfeeding.  The infant should be monitored for potential side
      effects.

## **Usage**

- Haloperidol is prescribed for the management of various psychotic disorders including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and other psychotic conditions. It is also used to control tics and vocalizations in Tourette's syndrome and to manage severe behavioral problems in children when other treatments have failed.  It can also be used to treat acute agitation and delirium.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Haloperidol is classified as a first-generation antipsychotic (also known as a neuroleptic).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Haloperidol primarily acts as a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist in the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways of the brain. This action is believed to be responsible for its antipsychotic effects.

## **Alternate Names**

- While "haloperidol" is the generic name, it is also marketed internationally under various brand names, the most common being Haldol, Haldol Decanoate (depot injection), and Haloperidol LA. Regional variations may exist.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Haloperidol exerts its therapeutic effects primarily through dopamine D2 receptor antagonism. It also has some affinity for alpha-adrenergic, histamine H1, and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, which contributes to some of its side effects.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Haloperidol is well-absorbed orally, but its bioavailability can vary.  The decanoate ester has a slow release profile, allowing for monthly injections.
    - **Metabolism:**  It is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4 enzymes.
    - **Elimination:** Haloperidol is eliminated through both renal and hepatic routes, with a half-life of approximately 24 hours (oral) and much longer for the decanoate formulation.
- **Mode of Action:**  By blocking dopamine D2 receptors, haloperidol reduces dopaminergic neurotransmission in the brain, particularly in the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways, believed to be involved in psychosis.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  As a potent D2 receptor antagonist, Haloperidol also has affinities for alpha-1 adrenergic, histamine H1, and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors which can mediate some of its side effects.  CYP3A4 hepatic enzyme interactions are a critical consideration when co-prescribing with Haloperidol.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism through CYP3A4 with renal and biliary excretion of metabolites.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Oral:** 0.5-5 mg two to three times daily initially, adjusted as needed.  The maximum daily dose is generally 100 mg, though higher doses may be used in some cases.  Maintenance doses are often lower.
- **IM (Haloperidol Lactate):** 2-5 mg every 4-8 hours, adjusted as needed.  Maximum daily dose is generally 20 mg.
- **IM (Haloperidol Decanoate):** 10-15 times the daily oral dose given monthly, not exceeding 100 mg initially.

#### **Children:**

- **3-12 years:** 0.05-0.15 mg/kg/day orally in divided doses. Dosage should be titrated carefully based on response and tolerability.
- **Below 3 years:**  Use with extreme caution.  Safety and efficacy not fully established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with half the lowest adult dose and titrate cautiously due to increased sensitivity.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary based on the degree of impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction is generally recommended.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Cardiovascular disease, seizures, and other conditions may require dose adjustments and careful monitoring.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:** Haloperidol can be used to manage agitation and delirium in these settings, typically with IV or IM administration of haloperidol lactate. Dosing must be individualized.
- **Emergency Situations:**  Acute agitation, psychosis, can be managed with IM haloperidol lactate.



### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- Dosage should be adjusted based on patient response, tolerability, and renal/hepatic function.
- Drug interactions, particularly with CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers, can necessitate dosage modifications.
