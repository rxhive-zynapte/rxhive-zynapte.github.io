## **Usage**

- Halothane is indicated for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Inhalation anesthetic.
- **Mechanism of action:** Halothane acts on the central nervous system to produce a dose-dependent depression of consciousness, leading to unconsciousness and analgesia. It affects multiple ion channels, depressing nerve conduction, breathing, and cardiac contractility. Its immobilizing effects are attributed to its binding to potassium channels in cholinergic neurons, as well as binding to NMDA and calcium channels.

## **Alternate Names**

- Fluothane (brand name, no longer available in the US)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Halothane depresses the central nervous system, causing unconsciousness and analgesia. It also relaxes skeletal muscle, suppresses salivary, bronchial, and gastric secretions, and dilates the bronchioles.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Absorbed rapidly through the lungs upon inhalation.
    - **Distribution:** Distributes widely throughout the body, with higher concentrations in tissues with high blood flow and lipid content, like the brain, liver, and adipose tissue. It also crosses the placenta and enters breast milk.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP2E1, and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4 and CYP2A6, producing trifluoroacetic acid, bromide, and chloride salts via oxidative pathways. A small amount is metabolized via reductive pathways.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through the lungs (60-80% unchanged) with the remainder excreted in urine and feces as metabolites.

- **Mode of action:**  Halothane primarily acts by enhancing the activity of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the central nervous system. This leads to hyperpolarization of neurons and reduces neuronal excitability. Halothane also inhibits NMDA receptors, further contributing to its anesthetic effects.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**  Enhances GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor activity and inhibits NMDA receptor activity.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily pulmonary excretion (unchanged) with a smaller portion excreted in urine and feces as metabolites.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Induction:** 0.5% to 3% v/v in oxygen or a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen, increased gradually as needed.
- **Maintenance:** 0.5% to 1.5% v/v, adjusted according to patient response and the flow rate used.

#### **Children:**

- **Induction:** 1.5% to 2% v/v.
- **Maintenance:** 0.5% to 1.5% v/v.
- **Pediatric safety considerations:** Halothane is generally avoided in children undergoing outpatient dental procedures due to the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Close monitoring of respiratory and cardiovascular function is crucial in pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and titrate carefully due to potential age-related decreases in organ function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be necessary, although specific guidelines are limited due to primarily pulmonary elimination. Close monitoring is required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Halothane is generally avoided in patients with pre-existing liver disease or a history of halothane-induced hepatitis due to the increased risk of hepatotoxicity.  If use is unavoidable, use lower doses and monitor liver function closely.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider specific conditions and potential drug interactions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation:**  Halothane can be used to facilitate intubation by relaxing the airway muscles.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Can be utilized for a wide range of surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Halothane can be used in patients requiring mechanical ventilation to facilitate sedation and muscle relaxation.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  May be used for short-term sedation and anesthetic management in the ICU setting.
- **Emergency Situations:** Limited role in emergency situations, mainly superseded by newer agents with better safety profiles.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on patient response, underlying medical conditions, and concomitant medications.
