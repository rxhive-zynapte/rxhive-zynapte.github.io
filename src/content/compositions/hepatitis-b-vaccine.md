## **Usage**

Hepatitis B vaccine is prescribed to prevent infection by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV infection can lead to serious liver diseases like hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Vaccine
- **Mechanism of Action:** Stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies against hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), conferring immunity against HBV infection.

## **Alternate Names**

Hepatitis B vaccine is also referred to as HepB vaccine or HBV vaccine. Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and formulation. Some examples include Engerix-B, Recombivax HB, Heplisav-B, and PreHevbrio. Combination vaccines including hepatitis B protection, like Pediarix and Vaxelis, are also available.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The vaccine induces active immunity by triggering the production of anti-HBsAg antibodies.  These antibodies neutralize the virus, preventing infection.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** The vaccine is administered intramuscularly.  The antigen is processed by antigen-presenting cells, leading to B-cell activation and antibody production. The pharmacokinetics of the individual components (aluminum adjuvant, yeast protein) are not typically monitored.
- **Mode of Action:**  The vaccine presents HBsAg to the immune system. This stimulates an adaptive immune response, resulting in antibody production.
- **Elimination Pathways:** The breakdown products of the vaccine are eliminated through normal physiological processes.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Engerix-B/Recombivax HB:** 1.0 mL IM at 0, 1, and 6 months (3-dose series).
- **Heplisav-B:** 0.5 mL IM at 0 and 1 month (2-dose series).
- **PreHevbrio:** 1.0 mL IM at 0, 1, and 6 months (3-dose series).

#### **Children:**

- **Engerix-B/Recombivax HB:** 0.5 mL IM at 0, 1, and 6 months (3-dose series). Combination vaccines containing HepB are frequently used in pediatric vaccination schedules and may have different dosing schedules.
- **Pediarix:** 0.5 mL IM at 2, 4, and 6 months.
- **Vaxelis:** 0.5 mL IM at 2, 4, and 6 months.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Same as adult dosing.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Same as adult dosing, although response may be reduced in hemodialysis patients, and higher doses or additional doses may be considered.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific dose adjustments are generally needed.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Specific clinical use cases do not apply to a preventative vaccine.  The vaccine is administered to prevent infection, not to treat a condition.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments might be necessary for hemodialysis patients (higher doses or additional doses).  For patients with other comorbidities, dosage adjustments are generally not required.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site.
- Fatigue, headache.
- Mild fever.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).

### **Long-Term Effects**

No long-term adverse effects from the hepatitis B vaccine have been identified.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Anaphylaxis is a rare but serious ADR requiring immediate medical intervention.


## **Contraindications**

- History of severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of the vaccine or any of its components (e.g., yeast).

## **Drug Interactions**

No clinically significant drug interactions are known.  Concurrent administration with other vaccines is generally safe and often practiced.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Hepatitis B vaccination is considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  The benefits of vaccination for both mother and child generally outweigh the risks.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Induces active immunity by stimulating the production of antibodies against HBsAg.
- **Side Effects:**  Common: injection site reactions, fatigue, headache, mild fever. Rare: anaphylaxis.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to vaccine components.
- **Drug Interactions:**  None known.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Safe.
- **Dosage:**  See detailed section above.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Anti-HBsAg antibody titers can be measured to assess immune response, particularly in high-risk individuals.


## **Popular Combinations**

The hepatitis B vaccine is often combined with other vaccines in pediatric formulations (e.g., DTaP-HB-IPV-Hib, Pediarix, Vaxelis) and adult formulations (Twinrix, a combined Hepatitis A and B vaccine).

## **Precautions**

- Standard precautions for intramuscular injections should be followed.
- Epinephrine should be available to manage potential anaphylactic reactions.
