## **Usage**

- This vaccine is prescribed for the prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) and its associated complications.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Vaccine.
- It works by stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies against the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles.  This boosts immunity, reducing the risk of VZV reactivation and the development of shingles.

## **Alternate Names**

- Zoster vaccine recombinant, Shingles vaccine.
- **Brand name:** Shingrix.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  The vaccine contains a noninfectious recombinant VZV glycoprotein E antigen combined with an adjuvant system (AS01B) to enhance the immune response. Upon administration, the vaccine triggers a targeted immune response against VZV glycoprotein E. This leads to the production of antibodies and specific T-cells which provide long-lasting protection against shingles. 
- **Pharmacokinetics:** The vaccine is administered intramuscularly. The specific pharmacokinetic parameters (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination) of the recombinant VZV glycoprotein E antigen have not been extensively studied. The adjuvant system is known to be locally absorbed at the injection site. No specific enzyme pathways or receptor interactions for either the antigen or adjuvant have been characterized for this vaccine. Elimination pathways have not been specifically studied for this vaccine.
