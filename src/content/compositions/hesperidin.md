## **Usage**

- Hesperidin, a bioflavonoid commonly found in citrus fruits, is primarily used to treat symptoms related to chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), such as varicose veins, leg swelling, pain, and restless legs syndrome. It is also used for acute and chronic hemorrhoids.  Some studies also support its use for conditions like high blood pressure and metabolic disorders.

- **Pharmacological classification:**  Vascular-protecting agent, Phlebotonic, Antioxidant.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Hesperidin strengthens blood vessel walls, reduces capillary permeability and fragility, improves venous tone, and exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It may also have beneficial effects on microcirculation, reducing edema.

## **Alternate Names**

- Hesperidina, Hesp√©ridine, Hesperidin Methyl Chalcone, Trimethylhesperidin-chalcon

- **Brand Names:** Daflon 500 (in combination with Diosmin)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Hesperidin and its aglycone metabolite, hesperetin, exert multiple effects on the vascular system, mainly through their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This leads to improved venous tone, reduced capillary permeability, and microcirculation improvement.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Hesperidin is orally absorbed and metabolized by the gut microbiota into hesperetin, which has better bioavailability. Hesperetin is further metabolized into glucuronides and other phenolic acids before being excreted mainly in urine and feces. The half-life is relatively short, with a significant portion excreted within 48 hours.

- **Mode of Action:** Hesperidin reduces inflammation by inhibiting inflammatory mediators and improves venous tone by modulating vascular smooth muscle function.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal and fecal excretion of metabolites.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- For CVI: 500mg twice daily or 1000mg once daily, taken with meals.
