## **Usage**

Histamine dihydrochloride is used as maintenance therapy in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first remission, concomitantly treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2).  Its efficacy has not been fully demonstrated in patients older than 60.  It is also used in skin prick testing to serve as a positive control.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Immunomodulator, positive control in allergy testing

- **Mechanism of Action:** Histamine dihydrochloride improves the immune-enhancing properties of IL-2, potentially inducing immune-mediated killing of leukemic cells. In allergy testing, it serves as a positive control, helping assess the patient's reactivity to histamine and validate the test's accuracy.



## **Alternate Names**

- Histamine
- Histamine phosphate
- Ceplene (brand name for AML treatment)


## **How It Works**

### Pharmacodynamics
Histamine exerts its effects by binding to histamine receptors (H1, H2, H3, and H4). Histamine dihydrochloride, when used with IL-2 in AML, is thought to enhance the immune response against leukemic cells. As a positive control in skin testing, it induces a localized allergic reaction (wheal and flare) due to H1 receptor stimulation, causing vasodilation and increased vascular permeability.

### Pharmacokinetics

- **Absorption:** After subcutaneous administration, histamine is rapidly absorbed.
- **Metabolism:** Histamine is rapidly metabolized by diamine oxidase and histamine-N-methyltransferase.
- **Elimination:** Histamine metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine.

### Mode of Action (AML Treatment)
Histamine dihydrochloride enhances the anti-leukemic effects of IL-2. Its precise mechanism is not fully understood, but may involve modulating immune cell function.
### Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation (Allergy Testing)
Histamine binds to H1 receptors in the skin, triggering vasodilation and increased vascular permeability.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

This pertains to the Ceplene brand for AML maintenance therapy and should be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in managing AML.

#### **Adults:**
- 0.5 mL (500 micrograms) subcutaneously twice daily, administered 1 to 3 minutes after a subcutaneous injection of IL-2 (16,400 IU/kg).
- Inject slowly over 5 to 15 minutes.

#### **Children:**  Not applicable for AML treatment.  For allergy skin testing, a tiny amount (e.g., 10 mg/mL) is administered intradermally.


#### **Special Cases:**  For AML Treatment: Dose modification based on individual patient tolerance. The dose reductions can be temporary or permanent. For elderly patients, dose adjustments are not typically necessary based solely on age but rather on renal or hepatic function. Dosage in renal or hepatic dysfunction needs to be adjusted based on individual patient response. For allergy testing, special consideration should be given to patients with dermatographism, where a lower concentration may be necessary.
