## **Usage**

- Human Antitetanus Immunoglobulin (TIG) is prescribed for both the **prevention (prophylaxis)** and **treatment** of tetanus. Prophylactically, it is administered to individuals with tetanus-prone wounds (e.g., deep or contaminated wounds, burns, animal bites) who are unvaccinated, inadequately vaccinated, or whose vaccination status is uncertain.  Therapeutically, it is used in conjunction with other treatments (e.g., antibiotics, muscle relaxants) to neutralize circulating tetanus toxin in patients with active tetanus infection.
- **Pharmacological classification:** TIG is classified as an immune serum and immunoglobulin.  Specifically, it's a human tetanus immunoglobulin.
- **Mechanism of action:** TIG provides passive immunity by directly neutralizing tetanus toxin, preventing it from binding to nerve endings and causing the characteristic muscle spasms of tetanus.

## **Alternate Names**

- Tetanus Immune Globulin (TIG)
- Tetanus antitoxin (primarily for equine-derived product)
- HyperTETÂ® (brand name)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** TIG binds to and neutralizes tetanus toxin in the bloodstream, preventing the toxin from reaching its target sites in the nervous system. It has no direct effect on the bacteria *Clostridium tetani* itself.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** TIG is administered intramuscularly (IM).  Absorption from the IM site is slow, with peak serum concentrations typically reached within 2-3 days. It is distributed throughout the extracellular fluid compartment. Metabolism of immunoglobulins is poorly understood, but they are primarily catabolized by cells throughout the body rather than through specific organ pathways. Elimination of TIG follows a first-order process with a half-life of approximately 3-4 weeks.
- **Mode of action:** TIG acts by binding directly to tetanus toxin, thereby neutralizing its toxic effects. This interaction is highly specific, involving the recognition of epitopes on the toxin molecule by the Fab portion of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies within TIG.
- **Receptor binding/enzyme inhibition/neurotransmitter modulation:** The primary mechanism of action of TIG is the direct neutralization of tetanus toxin. It doesn't bind to specific receptors, inhibit enzymes, or directly modulate neurotransmitters. 
- **Elimination pathways:** The elimination of TIG is complex and primarily involves catabolism rather than excretion through renal or hepatic pathways.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Prophylaxis: 250 IU IM as a single dose. 500 IU if the wound is heavily contaminated, there is significant tissue damage, or if more than 24 hours have elapsed since injury.
- Treatment:  3,000-6,000 IU IM. Dosing protocols vary depending on the severity of the infection.

#### **Children:**

- Prophylaxis: Same as adult dose. For children under 7 years, some guidelines suggest calculating the dose based on body weight (4 units/kg), however, administering the full 250 IU syringe is often recommended due to the potential for toxin production similar to adults.
- Treatment: Dosing protocols vary and should be determined based on the severity of the infection and clinical guidelines. Pediatric dosages are usually weight-based.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are typically required. However, consider comorbidities and overall health status.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustments are typically required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific dose adjustments are typically required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider comorbidities and potential drug interactions when determining the optimal treatment plan.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use/Emergency Situations:**  TIG is not typically indicated in these settings unless specifically for tetanus prophylaxis or treatment.

### **Dosage Adjustments:** No dose adjustments are routinely recommended based on hepatic or renal function, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Pain, tenderness, erythema, and induration at the injection site
- Mild fever
- Headache
- Myalgia
- Arthralgia



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from mild skin rash to anaphylaxis.
- Serum sickness



### **Long-Term Effects:**  No long-term adverse effects are typically associated with TIG administration.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Severe hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis) are rare but require immediate medical intervention.



## **Contraindications**

- History of anaphylactic reaction to human immunoglobulins.
- IgA deficiency with anti-IgA antibodies.
- Severe thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders that contraindicate IM injections (in such cases, subcutaneous administration may be considered for prophylaxis, though clinical data supporting this route is limited).


## **Drug Interactions**

- Live attenuated vaccines (e.g., measles, mumps, rubella): TIG may interfere with the immune response to these vaccines. Administration of live vaccines should be deferred for at least 3 months after TIG administration.
- Medications that bind to the human neonatal Fc receptor: Co-administration may decrease the efficacy of these medications.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Not formally categorized by the FDA. Data on use in human pregnancy is limited. However, based on experience with other immunoglobulins, no harmful effects on the fetus are expected.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Immunoglobulins are excreted in breast milk. No adverse effects on the breastfed infant are anticipated, and breastfeeding can continue after TIG administration.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Neutralization of tetanus toxin.
- **Side Effects:** Injection site reactions, mild fever, headache.  Rarely, hypersensitivity reactions.
- **Contraindications:**  Hypersensitivity to human immunoglobulins, IgA deficiency with anti-IgA antibodies.
- **Drug Interactions:** Live attenuated vaccines.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally considered safe.
- **Dosage:** Prophylaxis: 250-500 IU IM; Treatment: 3,000-6,000 IU IM.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Observe patient for signs of hypersensitivity reactions.


## **Popular Combinations**

- TIG is often administered concurrently with tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines (in separate syringes and injection sites) to provide both immediate passive immunity and stimulate long-term active immunity.



## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Aspirate before IM injection to avoid inadvertent intravascular administration.  Epinephrine should be readily available to manage potential hypersensitivity reactions.
- **Specific Populations (Pregnant Women/Breastfeeding Mothers/Children & Elderly/Menstruating Individuals):** No specific precautions for these populations beyond the general precautions mentioned above. 
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** No specific lifestyle considerations.
