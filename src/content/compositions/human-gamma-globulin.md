## **Usage**

Human Gamma Globulin, also known as Immune Globulin (IG), is prescribed for various medical conditions, primarily involving immune deficiencies and certain autoimmune or inflammatory disorders.  It is classified as an immunizing agent and immunomodulator. It functions by providing passive immunity through the administration of preformed antibodies, thereby bolstering the body's defense mechanisms against infections and modulating the immune response.

## **Alternate Names**

- Immune Globulin (IG)
- Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG)
- Subcutaneous Immunoglobulin (SCIG)
- Immunoglobulin G (IgG)

Brand names include:
- Gammagard Liquid
- Gammaked
- Gamunex-C
- Privigen
- Gammagard S/D

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Human Gamma Globulin exerts its effects by supplying a broad spectrum of antibodies against various bacterial and viral pathogens. This passive immunity provides immediate protection for individuals with compromised immune systems. In autoimmune conditions, the mechanism of action isn't fully understood but is thought to involve several pathways, including Fc receptor blockade, neutralization of autoantibodies, modulation of complement activation, and suppression of cytokine production.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
- **Absorption:** IVIG is directly administered into the bloodstream, resulting in 100% bioavailability. SCIG is absorbed gradually from the subcutaneous tissue.
- **Distribution:** Distributes throughout the intravascular and extravascular compartments.
- **Metabolism:** IgG is catabolized by reticuloendothelial cells.
- **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through intracellular catabolism, with a half-life variable based on the specific product and the patient's underlying condition. Elimination can be influenced by factors such as IgG serum levels, body weight, and disease state.

**Mode of Action:**
Human Gamma Globulin provides passive immunity by directly binding to antigens and facilitating their removal through various mechanisms, including opsonization, neutralization, and complement activation. In autoimmune diseases, it is believed to modulate the immune response through multiple actions like inhibiting B-cell activation, blocking Fc receptors, and suppressing inflammatory cytokine production.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Dosing varies significantly depending on the indication. For primary immunodeficiency, the typical starting dose is 0.4-0.8 g/kg given once, followed by 0.2-0.4 g/kg every 3-4 weeks. The dose is adjusted to achieve a target IgG trough level (usually 5-6 g/L).

#### **Children:** Pediatric dosing is generally weight-based, similar to adult dosing, and aims to achieve target IgG trough levels. Safety and efficacy have been established in pediatric populations for various indications.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be needed based on renal function and comorbidities.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Careful monitoring is crucial, and dose reduction may be required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are usually needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dose adjustments might be necessary depending on the comorbidity.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific medical settings are highly variable and should be individualized based on the patient's condition and response to therapy:

- **Intubation:** No standard IVIG dosage is associated with intubation itself.
- **Surgical Procedures:**  No standard IVIG dosage is linked to surgical procedures.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** No standard IVIG dosage.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** No standard IVIG dosage is specific to ICU use.
- **Emergency Situations:** Dosage depends on the specific emergency and the patient's condition.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**
Headache, fatigue, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling).


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS), acute renal failure, thrombosis, hemolytic anemia, anaphylaxis.


### **Long-Term Effects**
No specific long-term adverse effects have been consistently reported.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, require immediate medical attention.



## **Contraindications**

- Prior anaphylactic or severe systemic hypersensitivity reactions to human immunoglobulin.
- IgA deficiency with antibodies against IgA.


## **Drug Interactions**


Human Gamma Globulin can interact with live attenuated vaccines.  It is essential to avoid administering live vaccines for several months after IVIG treatment.  Consult specific product labeling and relevant guidelines for a comprehensive list of potential drug interactions.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Human gamma globulin crosses the placenta in significant amounts after 32 weeks of gestation.  It is considered relatively safe during pregnancy, but the benefits and risks should be carefully weighed.

- **Breastfeeding:** IgG is present in human milk. IVIG use during lactation is generally considered safe, and no specific precautions are typically required.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Provides passive immunity through a diverse repertoire of antibodies, modulates immune responses in autoimmune diseases.
- **Side Effects:** Common: Headache, fatigue, chills, nausea. Serious: Aseptic meningitis, acute renal failure, thrombosis.
- **Contraindications:**  Hypersensitivity to human immunoglobulin, IgA deficiency with anti-IgA antibodies.
- **Drug Interactions:** Live attenuated vaccines.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Generally safe;  placental transfer increases after 32 weeks.
- **Dosage:** Highly variable depending on the indication and patient-specific factors. Standard starting dose for primary immunodeficiencies: 0.4-0.8 g/kg followed by maintenance doses.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** IgG trough levels, renal function, signs of hypersensitivity or thrombotic events.

## **Popular Combinations**

Combination therapy may be indicated depending on the underlying condition being treated with IVIG.  There aren't "popular combinations" in the sense of fixed drug combinations.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Monitor for hypersensitivity reactions during and after infusion.  Assess renal function, particularly in high-risk patients.
- **Specific Populations:** Pregnancy: Monitor for potential fetal effects. Breastfeeding: No special precautions are generally required. Children and elderly: Dosage adjustments may be needed.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** No specific lifestyle restrictions are typically associated with IVIG therapy.
