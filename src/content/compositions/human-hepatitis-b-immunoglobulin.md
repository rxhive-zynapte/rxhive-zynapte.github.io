## **Usage**

Human Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (HBIG) is a sterile solution of antibodies specific to the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg). It is used for **post-exposure prophylaxis** to prevent hepatitis B infection after exposure to the virus and also for **pre-exposure prophylaxis** in specific populations.  It is also used to prevent recurrence of Hepatitis B in liver transplant patients. It falls under the pharmacological classification of **immunoglobulin**, specifically an **immune serum**.

HBIG works by providing passive immunity.  The antibodies in HBIG bind to HBsAg, neutralizing the virus and preventing it from infecting liver cells.  This passive immunity is temporary, providing immediate but short-term protection.


## **Alternate Names**

HBIG is also known as Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (Human). Brand names include:

* HyperHEP B® S/D
* HepaGam B®
* Nabi-HB®
* Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin-VF
* ImmunoGam



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** HBIG provides passive immunity by delivering pre-formed antibodies against HBsAg. These antibodies neutralize the hepatitis B virus, preventing infection of hepatocytes.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** When administered intramuscularly (IM), HBIG is absorbed into the systemic circulation.  Intravenous (IV) administration achieves immediate systemic levels.
* **Distribution:** HBIG distributes throughout the extracellular fluid compartment.
* **Metabolism:**  As a protein, HBIG is broken down into amino acids, mainly by the reticuloendothelial system.
* **Elimination:**  The elimination half-life of HBIG is variable, ranging from several weeks to months. It is not cleared via CYP enzymes.


**Mode of Action:** HBIG binds directly to HBsAg, the major surface antigen of HBV. This binding neutralizes the virus, thereby preventing attachment and entry into liver cells.  This prevents the establishment of infection. There is no receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation involved.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Post-exposure Prophylaxis:** 0.06 mL/kg (or 5 mL for adults), IM, as soon as possible after exposure (ideally within 24 hours, and up to 7 days). In some cases a second dose is recommended one month later.
* **Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (e.g. immunocompromised individuals at risk):** 500 IU every 2 months.


#### **Children:**

* **Post-exposure Prophylaxis:** 0.06 mL/kg IM, following the same timing guidelines as adults.  Specific pediatric dosages can range from 200 IU to 300 IU based on age.
* **Pre-exposure Prophylaxis**: 8 IU/kg, with a maximum of 500 IU every 2 months.
* **Neonates born to HBsAg-positive mothers:** 100 IU IM, preferably within 12 hours of birth, but no later than 48 hours.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are generally required. However, monitor for potential underlying conditions.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate on a case-by-case basis.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

HBIG is not typically administered in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or emergency situations for the primary purpose of those clinical settings. The use is limited to post-exposure prophylaxis.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be necessary for large volumes (&gt;2 mL in children, &gt;5 mL in adults) by dividing doses and administering at different sites.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Pain, redness, swelling at the injection site
* Mild fever
* Headache
* Nausea, vomiting
* Dizziness

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Anaphylaxis (rare but serious; requires immediate discontinuation)
* Hypotension

### **Long-Term Effects**

No specific long-term adverse effects have been identified.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to human immunoglobulin
* IgA deficiency with anti-IgA antibodies


## **Drug Interactions**

* Live attenuated vaccines (measles, mumps, rubella, varicella): Administer at least 3 months after HBIG.
* May interfere with serological tests.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

HBIG can be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding if clearly needed, but consult current clinical guidelines.  No specific precautions are required during breastfeeding after the infant has received the recommended HBIG and HBV vaccine doses.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Provides passive immunity via anti-HBs antibodies.
* **Side Effects:** Injection site reactions, fever, headache, nausea.  Rarely, anaphylaxis.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to human immunoglobulin, IgA deficiency with anti-IgA antibodies.
* **Drug Interactions:** Live attenuated vaccines, some serological tests.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Can be used if clinically indicated.
* **Dosage:** See detailed section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Anti-HBs antibody titers.

## **Popular Combinations**

HBIG is commonly used in conjunction with the hepatitis B vaccine for post-exposure prophylaxis to provide both immediate (passive) and long-term (active) protection.


## **Precautions**

* Administer IM.  Avoid intravenous administration due to the risk of severe reactions.
* Monitor for signs of hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis.
* In patients with bleeding disorders, subcutaneous administration can be considered if intravenous HBIG is unavailable.
