## **Usage**

- Human insulin/soluble insulin is prescribed for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It is also used to manage hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). In some cases, it's used during surgical procedures or in intensive care settings.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Rapid-acting insulin, antidiabetic agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Mimics the action of endogenous insulin, facilitating glucose uptake by cells in muscle, liver, and adipose tissue, thereby lowering blood glucose levels.

## **Alternate Names**

- Regular insulin, neutral insulin, soluble insulin
- **Brand Names:** Actrapid, Humulin R, Novolin R,  others.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Lowers blood glucose by promoting glucose uptake into cells and inhibiting hepatic glucose production.  It also affects fat and protein metabolism.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Rapidly absorbed following subcutaneous injection, with peak action within 1-3 hours. Intravenous administration results in immediate action.
    - **Metabolism:**  Primarily metabolized in the liver and kidneys.
    - **Elimination:**  Excreted primarily through the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:**  Binds to insulin receptors on cell surfaces, triggering a cascade of intracellular events leading to increased glucose transport into cells via GLUT4 transporters.
- **Receptor Binding:**  Binds to insulin receptors.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Type 1 Diabetes:** 0.5-1 unit/kg/day subcutaneously, divided into multiple doses.
- **Type 2 Diabetes:** Starting dose: 0.1-0.2 unit/kg/day or 10 units/day subcutaneously, usually given in the evening or divided twice daily. Titrate upwards based on blood glucose levels.

#### **Children:**

- Dose is individualized based on the child's weight, age, and metabolic needs, typically starting at 0.2-0.4 units/kg/day, divided into multiple doses. Pediatric endocrinologist consultation recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** May require lower doses due to age-related decline in renal function and insulin sensitivity.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be necessary depending on the degree of renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on other medical conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases:**

- **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:**  Continuous IV infusion at 0.1 unit/kg/hour is commonly used, titrated to maintain desired blood glucose levels.
- **Emergency Situations (e.g., DKA):**  0.1 unit/kg IV bolus followed by 0.1 unit/kg/hour continuous IV infusion. Alternatively, 0.14 unit/kg/hour IV infusion without bolus can be administered. Blood glucose levels must be closely monitored, and dose adjusted accordingly.  When blood glucose is <250 mg/dL, switch to glucose-containing fluids orally and reduce insulin to 0.05 unit/kg subcutaneously.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- Renal/hepatic dysfunction:  Reduce dose based on individual patient's clearance.
- Metabolic disorders:  Adjust dose based on specific metabolic needs.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), weight gain, injection site reactions (redness, swelling, itching).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Severe hypoglycemia (loss of consciousness, seizures), allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Lipodystrophy (changes in fat tissue at injection site) with repeated injections at the same site.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction).

## **Contraindications**

- Hypoglycemia.
- Hypersensitivity to insulin or any component of the formulation.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Medications that can affect blood sugar levels (e.g., corticosteroids, beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics).
- Alcohol can increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
- Beta-blockers can mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Generally considered safe during pregnancy. Blood glucose monitoring is crucial. Insulin requirements may change during pregnancy.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Insulin is not likely to be excreted in breast milk in significant amounts. Dosage adjustments may be necessary during breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Facilitates glucose uptake by cells, lowering blood glucose.
- **Side Effects:** Hypoglycemia, weight gain, injection site reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypoglycemia, hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:**  Corticosteroids, beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics, alcohol.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Generally safe, monitor blood glucose, may require dosage adjustments.
- **Dosage:**  Individualized, starting at 0.2-0.4 unit/kg/day for type 1 diabetes, 0.1-0.2 unit/kg/day for type 2 diabetes.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood glucose levels, HbA1c.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Often combined with intermediate- or long-acting insulins (e.g., NPH insulin, glargine) to provide both basal and bolus insulin coverage.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Monitor blood glucose regularly.  Rotate injection sites.
- **Specific Populations:** Dosage adjustments as needed for pregnant/breastfeeding women, children, and the elderly.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Diet and exercise play a significant role in managing diabetes.
