## **Usage**

Human Normal Immunoglobulin (HNIG) is prescribed for various medical conditions, primarily involving immunodeficiency or autoimmune processes. It is used as replacement therapy in primary immunodeficiency syndromes, hypogammaglobulinemia, and in patients after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It's also used as immunomodulatory therapy in conditions like  idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), Guillain-Barré syndrome, Kawasaki disease, and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN).

Its pharmacological classification is *immunoglobulin*.

HNIG's mechanism of action involves supplementing or modulating the body's existing antibodies to enhance immune response or suppress inappropriate immune activity.

## **Alternate Names**

Human Normal Immunoglobulin is also known as  IVIG (Intravenous Immunoglobulin) or immunoglobulin G (IgG). Brand names include, but aren't limited to, Kiovig, Privigen, Hizentra, Normoglobin, Flebogamma, Octagam, and Intratect.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** HNIG primarily works by increasing antibody levels in patients with deficient antibody production. It also modulates immune responses, potentially through Fc receptor blockade, inhibition of complement activation, neutralization of autoantibodies, and modulation of cytokine production.

**Pharmacokinetics:** When administered intravenously, HNIG is immediately available in the plasma. Subcutaneous administration results in gradual absorption, reaching peak serum concentrations in a few days.  HNIG is distributed throughout the extracellular fluid compartment. The half-life varies, generally ranging from 21 to 34 days, depending on the specific product and the patient's underlying condition. Elimination occurs primarily through catabolism with some excretion of metabolites in the urine. Specific metabolic pathways are not fully elucidated.

**Mode of Action:**  In replacement therapy, it passively replaces missing antibodies. In immunomodulatory therapy, it's thought to act via several complex mechanisms including  inhibition of B-cell activation and antibody production, blockage of Fc receptors on macrophages and other immune cells,  inhibition of complement activation, cytokine modulation, and idiotypic-anti-idiotypic interactions.

## **Dosage**

Dosage is highly individualized based on the patient's condition, age, weight, and clinical response. 

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The usual starting dose for replacement therapy is 0.4-0.8 g/kg given once, followed by at least 0.2 g/kg every three to four weeks. The dose is adjusted to maintain a trough IgG level of at least 5-6 g/L. For immunomodulation, higher doses may be needed.


#### **Children:** Similar to adults, adjusted for weight. Pediatric safety considerations include careful monitoring of infusion rate and potential for fluid overload.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Dose adjustments may be necessary based on renal function and comorbid conditions.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is required; dosage adjustments are based on the degree of impairment. 
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Generally, no specific dose adjustment is necessary, but caution is advised.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider underlying conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and pre-existing renal dysfunction when determining dose and monitoring for potential complications.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage for specific conditions varies greatly depending on the clinical picture and specific treatment protocols: ITP, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and Kawasaki disease generally require higher doses (e.g., 0.4 g/kg daily for 5 days or 2 g/kg as a single dose).


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on trough IgG levels, clinical response, and the occurrence of infections. Renal and hepatic function should also be considered.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Headache, chills, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, and injection site reactions (pain, swelling, redness).


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Aseptic meningitis, acute renal failure, thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis), and hemolytic anemia.


### **Long-Term Effects:**  Potential long-term effects with chronic use aren't fully understood but may include an increased risk of thromboembolic events.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** Anaphylaxis (rare), hypersensitivity reactions,  transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) (very rare).

## **Contraindications**

Absolute contraindications include known hypersensitivity to human immunoglobulins, particularly IgA deficiency with anti-IgA antibodies and hyperprolinemia type I or II. Relative contraindications include conditions that predispose to thromboembolic events or renal dysfunction (e.g., diabetes, hypercoagulable states, renal insufficiency).


## **Drug Interactions**

HNIG may interfere with the response to live attenuated vaccines.  It can interact with loop diuretics. Interactions with other medications, OTC drugs, supplements, or food are generally not significant, though caution is advised.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

HNIG is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It is categorized as FDA Pregnancy Category C.  IgG crosses the placenta, providing passive immunity to the fetus. It is also excreted into breast milk and may protect the neonate from certain infections.  However, clinical experience with pregnant women is limited, and the product should be used with caution.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Replaces or modulates antibodies to improve immune function or suppress autoimmune activity.
- **Side Effects:** Range from mild (headache, fever) to serious (aseptic meningitis, thrombosis).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to human immunoglobulins, IgA deficiency with anti-IgA antibodies, hyperprolinemia.
- **Drug Interactions:** Live attenuated vaccines, loop diuretics.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe, use with caution.
- **Dosage:** Highly variable; adjusted based on condition and response.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** IgG levels, renal function, signs of adverse reactions.

## **Popular Combinations**

HNIG is often used in conjunction with other medications depending on the specific condition being treated (e.g., acetylsalicylic acid in Kawasaki disease, antibiotics in severe infections).


## **Precautions**

- Screen patients for allergies, renal/hepatic function, and other relevant medical conditions before administration.
- Closely monitor for adverse reactions, especially during the first infusion.
- Use cautiously in patients with risk factors for thromboembolic events or renal dysfunction.
- Avoid concomitant use of live attenuated vaccines.
