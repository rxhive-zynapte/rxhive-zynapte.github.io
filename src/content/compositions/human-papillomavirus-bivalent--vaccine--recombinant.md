## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Human Papillomavirus Bivalent (Types 16 and 18) Vaccine, Recombinant (Cervarix) is a vaccine indicated for the prevention of diseases caused by HPV types 16 and 18, including cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 1, CIN 2 or worse, and adenocarcinoma in situ. Although this vaccine is still used in some countries, it is no longer available in the United States, where the 9-valent HPV vaccine is preferred.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Vaccine
- **Mechanism of Action:** Stimulates an immune response against HPV types 16 and 18 by producing noninfectious virus-like particles (VLPs) resembling HPV. These VLPs trigger the body to create antibodies, which protect against future HPV infections by the covered types.



## **Alternate Names**

- Cervarix
- Human Papillomavirus Bivalent Vaccine


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  The vaccine induces the production of neutralizing antibodies against HPV types 16 and 18. These antibodies prevent infection by blocking the virus from entering host cells.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Administered intramuscularly (IM), the vaccine components are slowly absorbed from the injection site. The recombinant L1 proteins are processed and presented to the immune system, triggering antibody production. Specific metabolic and elimination pathways have not been characterized. The vaccine itself contains no live biological material; after administration, the body breaks down the remaining non-active substances of the injection, and these harmless waste products are eliminated naturally.
- **Mode of Action:** The vaccine contains L1 proteins, the major capsid proteins of HPV types 16 and 18. These L1 proteins self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs). Upon administration, these VLPs mimic a natural HPV infection, stimulating both humoral and cellular immune responses.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Not applicable, as the vaccine's mode of action relies on immune stimulation, not direct interaction with receptors, enzymes, or neurotransmitters.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Not specifically characterized.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (Ages 9–26 years):**

0.5 mL IM administered in a 3-dose series at 0, 1, and 6 months. Current guidelines suggest that a 2-dose schedule may be sufficient in patients younger than 21 years of age.

#### **Children (Ages 9-14 years):**

0.5 mL IM administered in a 2-dose series at 0 and 6-12 months. If the second dose is given before 5 months, an additional dose is recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients (≥27 years):**  This vaccine has been approved for use up to age 45.  A 3-dose schedule (0, 2, 6 months) may be appropriate, but shared decision-making is recommended.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustments are necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustments are necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  No specific dosage adjustments are routinely recommended, but clinical judgment should be exercised for immunocompromised patients (including HIV-positive individuals), who may require a 3-dose schedule (0, 1-2, 6 months).




### **Clinical Use Cases**

This medication is exclusively for prophylactic (preventive) use, not for the treatment of established HPV infection or associated diseases. It is not relevant to the listed clinical settings (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, emergency situations).


### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific adjustments are routinely necessary based on patient-specific factors.  However, clinicians should consider a 3-dose schedule for immunocompromised patients.



## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects:**

- Injection site reactions (pain, swelling, redness)
- Headache
- Fatigue
- Myalgia
- Nausea



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Severe allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis)
- Syncope (fainting)


### **Long-Term Effects:**

No significant long-term side effects have been reported.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Anaphylaxis



## **Contraindications**

- History of severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any vaccine component (including yeast or polysorbate 80).



## **Drug Interactions**

- Immunosuppressants (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy) may reduce the vaccine's effectiveness.
- No clinically significant interactions with commonly prescribed medications, OTC drugs, or food/lifestyle factors have been reported.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** B (FDA classification prior to the drug's discontinuation in the US)
- This vaccine is generally avoided during pregnancy, although inadvertent administration is not an indication for pregnancy termination.
- Breastfeeding:  Vaccination is not contraindicated during breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Induces antibody production against HPV types 16 and 18 via VLPs.
- **Side Effects:** Common: injection site reactions, headache, fatigue, myalgia, nausea. Rare but serious:  anaphylaxis, syncope.
- **Contraindications:**  Severe allergy to any vaccine component.
- **Drug Interactions:** Immunosuppressants may reduce efficacy.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally avoided during pregnancy; compatible with breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** 3-dose series (0, 1, 6 months) or 2-dose series (0, 6-12 months) IM; special considerations for immunocompromised individuals.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Observation for syncope for 15 minutes post-vaccination.



## **Popular Combinations**

Not applicable. The vaccine is generally administered alone.



## **Precautions**

- Observe patients for 15 minutes post-vaccination for syncope.
- Pre-screening for contraindications (e.g., allergy history) is essential.
- Postpone vaccination in patients with acute febrile illness.
- Avoid during pregnancy, unless accidental exposure has already occurred.
