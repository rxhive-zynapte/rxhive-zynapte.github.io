## **Usage**

Hydrocortisone is a glucocorticoid, a class of corticosteroids, prescribed for a wide range of medical conditions. It is used to treat adrenocortical insufficiency, inflammatory and rheumatic disorders, allergic conditions, certain skin diseases, respiratory problems like asthma and COPD, certain cancers, and other conditions where its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions are beneficial.  Its pharmacological classifications include corticosteroid, anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and antiallergic.

Hydrocortisone mimics the action of cortisol, a hormone naturally produced by the adrenal glands. It exerts its effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm of target cells. This complex then translocates to the nucleus, where it modulates the transcription of various genes involved in inflammation, immune response, and metabolism.

## **Alternate Names**

Hydrocortisone is also known as cortisol. Brand names for hydrocortisone include Cortef, Solu-Cortef, Hydrocortisoneâ€“AFT, and others depending on the formulation and region. Plenadren is a brand name for modified-release hydrocortisone.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Hydrocortisone binds to glucocorticoid receptors, leading to decreased inflammation, immunosuppression, and changes in metabolism.  It inhibits inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes, reduces capillary permeability, and suppresses leukocyte migration.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Hydrocortisone can be administered orally, intravenously, intramuscularly, topically, or rectally.  Absorption varies depending on the route of administration.  It is metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP3A4 enzymes and excreted by the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** The hydrocortisone-receptor complex binds to specific DNA sequences called glucocorticoid response elements, affecting gene expression. It can also interact with other transcription factors, modulating their activity.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Hydrocortisone primarily binds to glucocorticoid receptors. It inhibits phospholipase A2, reducing the production of arachidonic acid and downstream inflammatory mediators.

**Elimination Pathways:** Hydrocortisone is metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4, and excreted in the urine.


## **Dosage**

Dosages vary significantly based on the condition being treated, route of administration, and patient-specific factors.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Oral: 10-320 mg/day, divided into several doses.  Intravenous/Intramuscular: 100-500 mg initially, repeated as needed every 2, 4, or 6 hours.


#### **Children:**

Dosing is typically based on body weight or body surface area (BSA) and varies widely depending on the indication. For example, in adrenocortical insufficiency, children might receive 1-2 mg/kg IV every 6 hours initially, with a maximum dose of 250 mg. Pediatric dosing requires careful consideration of growth and development, as well as potential long-term effects on bone health and growth suppression with prolonged use.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Start with lower doses and monitor closely for side effects. Dose adjustments may be necessary due to age-related decline in organ function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be required in severe renal impairment. Monitor renal function and adjust accordingly.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is recommended for mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In severe hepatic impairment, monitor closely and consider dose adjustments.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments may be required in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or other comorbid conditions. Monitor closely for adverse effects and disease-specific complications.


### **Clinical Use Cases:**

* **Intubation:**  In patients with known or suspected adrenal insufficiency, a hydrocortisone bolus (e.g., 100 mg IV) may be given prior to intubation.
* **Surgical Procedures:** Patients on chronic glucocorticoid therapy often require stress-dose hydrocortisone before, during, and after surgery to prevent adrenal crisis. Doses and regimens vary depending on the magnitude of the surgery. For major surgery, 100mg IV at induction followed by 100mg every 6 hours or 200mg continuous IV infusion over 24 hours.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** In patients with sepsis and septic shock requiring vasopressor support, hydrocortisone 200mg/day is often administered.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Hydrocortisone is often used for the management of critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) and septic shock.
* **Emergency Situations:**  In adrenal crisis, 100 mg hydrocortisone IV bolus is given, followed by continuous infusion or divided doses. For status epilepticus, higher doses (e.g., 18 mg/kg, max 1800 mg) of IV hydrocortisone may be used.


### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dose modifications are based on patient response, disease severity, and the presence of renal or hepatic dysfunction. Therapeutic drug monitoring and close clinical observation are crucial for optimizing therapy and minimizing adverse events.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Fluid retention, weight gain, increased appetite, mood changes, insomnia, hyperglycemia, increased susceptibility to infections.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Peptic ulcers, osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, adrenal suppression, Cushing's syndrome, psychosis, allergic reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Growth retardation in children, osteoporosis, cataracts, glaucoma, diabetes, hypertension, increased risk of infections.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), adrenal crisis (upon abrupt discontinuation), hypertensive crisis, hyperglycemia, severe infections.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone, systemic fungal infections, serious infections (unless specific anti-infective therapy is employed concurrently), vaccination with live virus vaccines (in patients receiving immunosuppressive doses).


## **Drug Interactions**

Hydrocortisone interacts with numerous medications, including:

* **CYP3A4 Inducers/Inhibitors:**  These alter hydrocortisone metabolism.
* **Anticholinesterases:** May exacerbate weakness in myasthenia gravis.
* **Anticoagulants:** Effects may be enhanced or reduced.
* **Antidiabetics:**  Hydrocortisone can increase blood glucose, counteracting antidiabetic effects.
* **NSAIDs:** Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
* **Potassium-depleting diuretics:**  Increased risk of hypokalemia.

Interactions with OTC drugs, supplements, alcohol, and grapefruit juice are also possible.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Hydrocortisone is generally considered safe during pregnancy but should be used only when clearly needed.  It is excreted in breast milk, but the effects on nursing infants are not fully known.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Binds to glucocorticoid receptors, modulating gene expression and affecting inflammation, immune response, and metabolism.
* **Side Effects:** Fluid retention, weight gain, hyperglycemia, increased risk of infections, osteoporosis (long-term use).
* **Contraindications:** Systemic fungal infections, serious infections, hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors, anticoagulants, antidiabetics, NSAIDs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe during pregnancy when needed; excreted in breast milk.
* **Dosage:** Highly variable depending on indication and patient factors.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood glucose, electrolytes, blood pressure, signs of infection, growth in children (with long-term use).


## **Popular Combinations**

Hydrocortisone is often combined with mineralocorticoids (like fludrocortisone) in adrenal insufficiency.  It may also be used with other medications for specific conditions (e.g., bronchodilators in asthma).


## **Precautions**

General precautions include screening for infections, diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, and other conditions that might be exacerbated by hydrocortisone. Specific precautions apply to pregnant/breastfeeding women, children, elderly individuals, and patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction. Lifestyle considerations include limiting alcohol and sodium intake, and avoiding exposure to infections.
