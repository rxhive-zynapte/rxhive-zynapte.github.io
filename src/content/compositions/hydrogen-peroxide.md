      What happens if I accidentally swallow hydrogen peroxide?**


      **A:** Swallowing small amounts of diluted hydrogen peroxide may cause
      mild gastrointestinal upset.  Ingesting larger quantities, especially of
      higher concentrations, can lead to more serious complications such as gas
      embolism. Seek immediate medical attention if a significant amount is
      swallowed.

## **Usage**

Hydrogen peroxide is primarily used as a topical antiseptic for cleaning minor wounds, scrapes, and burns to prevent infection. It can also be used as a mouth rinse to remove mucus, relieve minor mouth irritation (e.g., canker sores, gingivitis), and for oral debridement.  Its pharmacological classification is antiseptic and oxidizing agent.  The mechanism of action involves the release of oxygen upon contact with tissue, creating a foaming action that helps to remove debris and kill bacteria.

## **Alternate Names**

Other names for hydrogen peroxide include dihydrogen dioxide, hydrogen dioxide, hydroperoxide, and peroxide. Brand names vary depending on the product formulation and country. Some examples include Peroxyl and Orajel.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Hydrogen peroxide exerts its antiseptic effect through the release of oxygen. This creates an oxidizing environment hostile to anaerobic bacteria.  The foaming action helps to mechanically debride the wound, removing debris and dead tissue.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Topical hydrogen peroxide is minimally absorbed systemically. When used as a mouth rinse, small amounts may be swallowed, but it is rapidly decomposed in the digestive tract.  It is not metabolized by CYP enzymes.

**Mode of Action:** Hydrogen peroxide acts as an oxidizing agent, disrupting the essential cell components of microorganisms like membrane lipids, DNA, and proteins.

**Elimination:**  Topically applied hydrogen peroxide decomposes into water and oxygen. Any ingested hydrogen peroxide is rapidly broken down in the gastrointestinal tract.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Topical antiseptic:** Apply a small amount of 3% hydrogen peroxide solution to the affected area 1-3 times daily.
* **Mouth rinse/gargle:** Rinse or gargle with a diluted solution (1 part 3% hydrogen peroxide with 2 parts water) for 1 minute, then spit out. Repeat up to 4 times daily after meals and at bedtime. Do not swallow.
* **Oral debriding agent:** Use as directed by a healthcare professional, typically swishing a diluted solution (1.5% or as directed) for at least one minute, then spitting out.

#### **Children:**

* **Topical antiseptic:** Use 3% hydrogen peroxide solution as directed by a healthcare professional.
* **Mouth rinse/gargle:** Use with caution and as directed by a healthcare professional. For children under 3 years of age, there is no recommended dosage except under the advice and supervision of a dentist or doctor.
* **Oral debriding agent:** For children over 2 years of age, mix with an equal amount of water; swish around the mouth in the affected area for at least 1 minute, then spit out. Use up to four times a day.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are typically required.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustments are typically required due to minimal systemic absorption.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments are typically required due to minimal systemic absorption.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific dose adjustments are typically required, but use with caution in patients with severe open wounds or compromised immune systems.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Hydrogen peroxide is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or intensive care units except for potential use in oral debridement.  Its use is generally limited to topical wound cleansing and as a mouth rinse/gargle. Emergency situations sometimes necessitate the use of hydrogen peroxide as a debriding agent for necrotic tissue.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific dosage adjustments are usually necessary due to minimal systemic absorption. However, individual product recommendations should be consulted, especially for higher concentrations.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Transient stinging or burning at the application site
* Temporary whitening of skin or hair at the application site
* Oxygen bubbles forming in the mouth (when used as a mouth rinse)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Severe skin irritation or burns (with high concentrations)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Gas embolism (if ingested in large amounts)

### **Long-Term Effects**

No significant long-term side effects are known from topical use.  Prolonged or excessive use as a mouthwash can cause hypertrophy of the tongue papillae.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe skin reactions and gas embolism are potential ADRs.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to hydrogen peroxide
* Use in deep wounds, animal bites, or serious burns
* Use in closed body cavities or surgical wounds


## **Drug Interactions**

Hydrogen peroxide can interact with other oxidizing agents (e.g., iodine, potassium permanganate), some metals, and certain organic materials, potentially leading to hazardous reactions. No clinically significant interactions with commonly prescribed medications, OTC drugs, or food have been reported for topical use.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Hydrogen peroxide is considered safe for topical use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Systemic absorption is minimal and unlikely to pose a risk to the fetus or infant.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Releases oxygen, creating an oxidizing environment and facilitating mechanical debridement.
* **Side Effects:** Stinging, burning, temporary whitening, gas embolism (rare).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, deep wounds, closed body cavities.
* **Drug Interactions:** Other oxidizing agents, certain metals.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe for topical use.
* **Dosage:** Topical: Apply 1-3 times daily. Mouth rinse: Dilute and use up to 4 times daily. Refer to product-specific instructions.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Observe for signs of skin irritation or allergic reaction.

## **Popular Combinations**

Hydrogen peroxide is not typically used in combination with other drugs for topical antiseptic purposes or as a mouth rinse.

## **Precautions**

* Avoid contact with eyes.
* Do not use in closed body cavities or on deep wounds.
* Discontinue use if severe irritation develops.
* Do not swallow when used as a mouth rinse.
