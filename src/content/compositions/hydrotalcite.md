## **Usage**

Hydrotalcite is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), heartburn, gastritis, peptic ulcers, and other conditions associated with excessive stomach acid.  It can also provide relief from symptoms related to hyperacidity, such as stomach upset and acid indigestion. It is sometimes combined with simethicone to also address flatulence and bloating by reducing the surface tension of gas bubbles.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antacid.

**Mechanism of Action:** Hydrotalcite is an aluminum magnesium hydroxide carbonate hydrate that neutralizes excess stomach acid by reacting with hydrochloric acid in the gastric secretions to form aluminum chloride and water. This reaction increases the pH of the stomach contents, offering relief from acid-related discomfort.  This also inhibits pepsin activity and may offer cytoprotective effects by increasing bicarbonate and prostaglandin levels.

## **Alternate Names**

Aluminum magnesium hydroxide carbonate hydrate.

**Brand Names:**  Megalac, Talcid,  and numerous other brand names depending upon the country and specific formulation (often combined with other medications). Some combination brands with simethicone include Simeco, Talsil Forte, and Promag.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Hydrotalcite neutralizes gastric acid, raises intragastric pH, and inhibits pepsin activity. It works locally in the stomach and is minimally absorbed systemically.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:** Minimal systemic absorption.
* **Metabolism:** Not metabolized.
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted unchanged in the feces.

**Mode of Action:** Hydrotalcite acts locally by chemically neutralizing hydrochloric acid in the stomach.  It is poorly absorbed. 

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** It does not have receptor binding activity but may reduce pepsin's enzymatic activity indirectly through increased pH.

**Elimination Pathways:** Excreted primarily via feces.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Tablets (e.g., Megalac, Simeco):** 1-2 tablets (500mg each)  or as prescribed, several times per day as needed, typically one to two hours after meals and at bedtime.  Do not exceed 12 tablets (6000 mg of hydrotalcite) in 24 hours. Chew tablets thoroughly before swallowing.
* **Suspension:** 10ml (containing 500mg/5ml hydrotalcite), three to four times a day between meals and at bedtime.
* **Powder/Sachet:** 1-2 sachets (dose dependent on specific product) three to four times a day.

#### **Children:**

* **6-12 years:**  Half the adult dose.  Use with caution in children under 6. The safety and effectiveness have not been established in children under 6 years for most formulations. Consult the package label or prescribing information.
* **2-12 years (simethicone component):** 40mg four times a day.
* **<2 years (simethicone component):** 20mg four times a day.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution. Monitor for phosphate depletion and aluminum toxicity. Dosage adjustment may be needed due to potential for reduced renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use cautiously. Reduce dosage as needed.  Aluminum-containing antacids may worsen hypermagnesemia in patients with renal failure.  Serum aluminum levels should not exceed 40 µg/L.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Monitor closely. No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised. Monitor for potential drug interactions. 


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of hydrotalcite in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, and the ICU should be guided by the patient’s individual needs and the clinical context. There are no specific dosage guidelines for these settings and any use of this drug in such situations is dependent upon the judgement of the physician. 

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be necessary based on patient-specific factors, including renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism. Close monitoring is essential.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Constipation, diarrhea, vomiting.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Aluminum toxicity (especially in patients with renal impairment), encephalopathy, osteomalacia (with prolonged use and low phosphate diet),  hypophosphatemia, hypermagnesemia. 

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Osteomalacia (with prolonged high doses and low phosphate diet), aluminum toxicity (in patients with impaired renal function).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Aluminum toxicity, encephalopathy, hypermagnesemia, hypophosphatemia.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to hydrotalcite or any component of the formulation.
* Severe renal impairment.
* Hypophosphatemia.
* Bowel obstruction.


## **Drug Interactions**

Hydrotalcite may decrease the absorption of various drugs, including tetracyclines, quinolones, cardiac glycosides, iron preparations, and corticosteroids. It's crucial to administer other medications 1-2 hours before or after hydrotalcite.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Although hydrotalcite's systemic absorption is minimal, consult a doctor before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. The potential benefits should outweigh any risks.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Neutralizes stomach acid.
* **Side Effects:** Constipation, diarrhea, vomiting; rarely, aluminum toxicity, osteomalacia, encephalopathy.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe renal impairment, hypophosphatemia, bowel obstruction.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Reduces absorption of tetracyclines, quinolones, cardiac glycosides, iron, corticosteroids.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult a doctor before use.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 1-2 tablets or 10 ml suspension several times daily; children: Half adult dose (6-12 years). Adjust for renal impairment.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Serum magnesium, aluminum, and phosphate levels (especially in long-term use or renal impairment).


## **Popular Combinations**

Hydrotalcite is often combined with simethicone to address both hyperacidity and flatulence.


## **Precautions**

* Avoid prolonged use without medical supervision.
* Monitor patients with renal impairment.
* Caution in patients on a low-phosphate diet.
* Evaluate for serious underlying conditions if symptoms persist.
