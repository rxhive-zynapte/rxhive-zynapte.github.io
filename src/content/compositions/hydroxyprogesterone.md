## **Usage**

- Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is prescribed to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women with a singleton pregnancy who have a history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth.  It is not intended for use in women with multiple gestations or other risk factors for preterm birth. Off-label uses include the management of amenorrhea, abnormal uterine bleeding due to hormonal imbalance, and advanced endometrial cancer. It can also be used to test for endogenous estrogen production.

- **Pharmacological classification**: Progestin (a synthetic form of progesterone, a female hormone).

- **Mechanism of action**: Although the exact mechanism for preventing preterm birth is not fully understood, hydroxyprogesterone likely works by quieting uterine contractions and suppressing the maternal immune response against the fetus. It also helps in thickening and maintaining the uterine lining (endometrium).

## **Alternate Names**

- 17Î±-Hydroxyprogesterone caproate
- 17-OHPC

- **Brand names**: Makena

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Hydroxyprogesterone binds to progesterone receptors, mimicking the effects of endogenous progesterone. This leads to decreased myometrial activity and quieting of uterine contractions. Also modifies the maternal immune response, reducing the chances of fetal rejection.

- **Pharmacokinetics**:
    - **Absorption**: After intramuscular injection, peak serum levels are reached in 3 to 7 days. Subcutaneous absorption is similar but may be slightly slower.
    - **Metabolism**: Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes. Metabolites include sulfated and glucuronidated products.
    - **Elimination**:  Both conjugated metabolites and free steroids are excreted in the urine and feces, predominantly as conjugated metabolites.

- **Mode of action**: Hydroxyprogesterone acts as a progesterone receptor agonist. Upon binding, it modulates gene expression, influencing various physiological processes related to pregnancy maintenance.

- **Receptor binding**: Primarily binds to progesterone receptors. Exhibits minimal binding to other steroid hormone receptors.

- **Enzyme inhibition/modulation**: Minimal potential for CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6 inhibition at clinically relevant concentrations. Not likely to inhibit CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 at therapeutic concentrations.

- **Elimination pathways**: Primarily hepatic metabolism followed by renal and fecal excretion of conjugated metabolites.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Intramuscular (IM): 250 mg IM once weekly (every 7 days) injected slowly (over 1 minute) into the upper outer quadrant of the gluteus maximus.
- Subcutaneous (SC): 275 mg SC once weekly via auto-injector into the back of either upper arm.
- Initiate treatment between 16 weeks, 0 days and 20 weeks, 6 days of gestation.
- Continue weekly administration until 37 weeks of gestation or delivery, whichever occurs first.

#### **Children:**

- Not indicated for use in patients younger than 16 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: Not intended for use in postmenopausal women.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**:  No specific dosage adjustments are available. Use with caution.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Contraindicated in patients with active liver disease.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Use with caution in patients with diabetes, hypertension, epilepsy, cardiac dysfunction, renal dysfunction, and history of depression. Monitor closely for disease exacerbation.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is not indicated for use in the following clinical settings:

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**

## **Drug Interactions**

-  Hydroxyprogesterone is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and may interact with drugs that induce or inhibit this enzyme.
- Concurrent use with enzyme inducers (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, St. John's Wort) may decrease hydroxyprogesterone levels.
-  Concurrent use with enzyme inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, grapefruit juice) may increase hydroxyprogesterone levels.
- May interact with anticoagulants, potentially decreasing their efficacy.
- Refer to a comprehensive drug interaction database for a complete list of interactions.
