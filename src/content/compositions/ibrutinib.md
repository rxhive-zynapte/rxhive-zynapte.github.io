## **Usage**

Ibrutinib is prescribed for the treatment of several B-cell malignancies, including:

*   **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL):**  Used in patients with or without 17p deletion, including as first-line therapy for those with a 17p deletion unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy.
*   **Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia (WM):**  Can be used as a single agent or in combination with rituximab.
*   **Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL):**  Used in relapsed or refractory cases.
*   **Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (cGVHD):**  For patients who have not responded to one or more lines of systemic therapy.
*   **Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL):** Approved dose is 560 mg daily.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Ibrutinib is a kinase inhibitor, specifically a Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor.

**Mechanism of Action:** Ibrutinib irreversibly binds to BTK, inhibiting its activity. BTK plays a crucial role in B-cell receptor signaling, which is essential for B-cell survival and proliferation. By inhibiting BTK, ibrutinib disrupts B-cell receptor signaling, leading to decreased B-cell activation, proliferation, and survival, ultimately suppressing the growth of malignant B-cells. Ibrutinib also inhibits interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK). This inhibition of BTK and ITK is believed to contribute to its efficacy in treating cGVHD.

## **Alternate Names**

**International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Ibrutinib

**Brand Name:** Imbruvica

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ibrutinib primarily targets B-cells by irreversibly inhibiting BTK, leading to the disruption of B-cell receptor signaling pathways crucial for their survival and proliferation. This targeted action results in the suppression of malignant B-cell growth. Additionally, it inhibits ITK, contributing to its effect on T-cells and its effectiveness in cGVHD treatment.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:**  Ibrutinib is well-absorbed orally, with higher absorption when taken with food. However, it can be administered with or without food.
*   **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4.
*   **Elimination:**  Excreted mainly through feces, with a small portion excreted in urine.

**Mode of Action:** Ibrutinib forms a covalent bond with a cysteine residue in the BTK active site, leading to irreversible inhibition. This prevents BTK from phosphorylating downstream targets, effectively blocking B-cell receptor signaling.


**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Ibrutinib primarily acts through irreversible inhibition of BTK.  It also inhibits ITK.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4, followed by fecal excretion. Minor renal excretion.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   **CLL/SLL:** 420 mg orally once daily.
*   **WM:** 420 mg orally once daily.
*   **MCL:** 560 mg orally once daily.
*   **MZL:** 560 mg orally once daily.
*   **cGVHD:** 420 mg orally once daily.


#### **Children (1 to <12 years):**

*   **cGVHD:** 240 mg/m² orally once daily (not to exceed 420 mg/dose). Dose adjustments may be based on body surface area (BSA).  Refer to detailed pediatric dosing guidelines for specific BSA ranges and corresponding doses (see source materials for precise calculation charts).

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustment is required.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment needed for mild or moderate impairment (creatinine clearance >30 mL/min).  Use with caution in severe renal impairment. Monitor closely for signs of toxicity.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
    *   Mild Impairment (Child-Pugh A): 280 mg orally once daily.
    *   Moderate Impairment (Child-Pugh B): 140 mg orally once daily.
    *   Severe Impairment (Child-Pugh C): Not recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider underlying cardiac conditions, bleeding disorders, and concurrent medications.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  Ibrutinib is not typically indicated for acute conditions like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or emergency situations.  Its usage focuses on chronic management of B-cell malignancies and cGVHD.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose reductions may be necessary for managing specific side effects (e.g., hematological toxicity, non-hematological toxicity). Refer to detailed dosage adjustment guidelines provided in the source materials.  Consider drug interactions, especially with CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers, which may necessitate dosage modifications.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, bruising, rash, headache, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, arthralgia, peripheral edema, and neutropenia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Bleeding (including major hemorrhage), severe infections, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, second primary malignancies (including skin cancers), and tumor lysis syndrome.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Increased risk of infections, second primary malignancies, and cardiovascular complications with prolonged use. Regular monitoring is crucial.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe bleeding events, atrial fibrillation, serious infections, and tumor lysis syndrome.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to ibrutinib.
* Concomitant use of St. John's Wort.

## **Drug Interactions**

Ibrutinib has numerous drug interactions, particularly with:

* **CYP3A4 Inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, voriconazole):**  Increase ibrutinib exposure. Dose reduction or avoidance may be necessary.
* **CYP3A4 Inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine):** Decrease ibrutinib exposure. Avoid concomitant use if possible.
* **Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Agents:** Increased risk of bleeding. Close monitoring required.
* **Grapefruit or Seville Oranges:** Contain CYP3A4 inhibitors and increase ibrutinib levels. Avoid consumption.

Consult a comprehensive drug interaction resource for a full list.
