## **Usage**

Ichthyol Pale, also known as Sodium Sulfoichthyolate, is primarily used in **cosmetic** formulations for skin and hair care. It's indicated for conditions like scaling scalp, skin blemishes, and other skin disorders.  It's classified as an **anti-inflammatory** and **antiseborrheic** agent. Its mechanism of action involves reducing inflammation and inhibiting sebum production.

## **Alternate Names**

- Sodium Sulfoichthyolate
- IchthyolÂ® Pale (brand name)
- Neo Ittiolo

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ichthyol Pale exerts anti-inflammatory, antiseborrheic, and mild antiseptic effects.  It is believed to work by keratoplastic, antipruritic, and weak antiseptic action.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The percutaneous absorption of Ichthyol Pale is limited.  Available studies primarily focus on its topical effects, and detailed pharmacokinetic data (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) are not extensively documented for cosmetic applications.

**Mode of Action:** The precise molecular mechanism is not fully elucidated, but it is thought to involve multiple pathways, including inhibition of inflammatory mediators and modulation of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. Specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation have not been clearly identified. Elimination pathways are not well-defined due to limited systemic absorption after topical use.

## **Dosage**

Ichthyol Pale is typically used in cosmetic preparations at concentrations ranging from 0.5% to 2.5%. The specific dosage and application frequency depend on the product formulation and the condition being treated.

#### **Special Cases:** Dosage adjustments in special populations (elderly, renal/hepatic impairment, comorbid conditions) are not typically relevant for cosmetic applications of Ichthyol Pale due to limited systemic absorption.  However, it is always prudent to exercise caution and consult a healthcare professional if needed.
