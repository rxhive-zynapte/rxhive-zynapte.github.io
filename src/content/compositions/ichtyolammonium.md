## **Usage**

Ichtyolammonium is primarily used as a topical treatment for various skin disorders, such as eczema, psoriasis, and inflammatory skin conditions.  It is also used for boils, abscesses, and other skin infections. Its pharmacological classifications include antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, keratolytic, and antibacterial agent.  It works by reducing inflammation, decreasing bacterial and fungal growth, softening the skin, and drawing out pus and fluids from infected areas.

## **Alternate Names**

- Ammonium bituminosulfonate
- Ichthammol
- Ichthyol
- Black ointment
- Drawing salve (not to be confused with black salve)
- Exsora Ointment (brand name)



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ichtyolammonium exerts anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and antibacterial effects.  It softens the skin (keratolytic action) and promotes the drawing out of pus and fluids from boils and abscesses. The exact mechanism at the cellular level is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve the suppression of inflammatory mediators and inhibition of bacterial/fungal growth. Specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation are not well-defined for this medication.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Primarily applied topically. Systemic absorption is limited, but can occur with prolonged use over large areas, especially if the skin is broken. The metabolism and elimination pathways are not fully characterized for topical application.


## **Dosage**

Ichtyolammonium is for topical use only, typically available as an ointment (10% or 20% concentration) or in combination products.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer to the affected skin area 2–3 times daily or as directed by a physician.  May be covered with a dressing.

#### **Children:** Use under the guidance of a healthcare provider. Application is similar to adults, with dosage adjustments based on age and body weight. Consult drug labeling for pediatric-specific recommendations.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are usually needed.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No specific adjustments required due to limited systemic absorption.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific adjustments required due to limited systemic absorption.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution with large areas of damaged skin, especially in patients with diabetes or metabolic disorders.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Ichtyolammonium's clinical use is limited to topical skin conditions. It's not typically used systemically in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be necessary based on individual response and tolerance.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Skin irritation (redness, itching, burning) at the application site
- Dryness
- Allergic skin reactions



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Blistering
- Stretch marks (with prolonged use)
- Systemic effects (changes in blood sugar, Cushing's syndrome) with prolonged use over large skin areas.
- Severe allergic reactions (angioedema, anaphylaxis) - rare, but require immediate medical attention.

### **Long-Term Effects**
- Skin atrophy
- Telangiectasia
- Hypopigmentation (with prolonged use)

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe allergic reactions


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any components
- Open wounds or broken skin (for some formulations)
- Severely irritated or inflamed skin

## **Drug Interactions**

- Concurrent use of potent topical medications on the same area might increase irritation.
- Interactions with oral medications are unlikely due to limited systemic absorption, except with extensive or prolonged use.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Animal studies suggest potential fetal risk.  Limited data are available on drug excretion in breast milk.  Consult a physician before use. Weigh benefits and risks carefully.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, antibacterial, keratolytic.
- **Side Effects:** Skin irritation, allergic reactions, dryness.  Rarely, blistering, stretch marks, or systemic effects.

## **Precautions**

- Avoid contact with eyes, mucous membranes.
- Discontinue use if severe irritation develops.
