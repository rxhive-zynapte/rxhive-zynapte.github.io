## Usage

Iguratimod is prescribed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It's classified as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD).  It works by modulating the immune response, suppressing the production of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), and inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). It may also suppress immunoglobulin production, and inhibit osteoclast differentiation, impacting bone metabolism.

## Alternate Names

While "Iguratimod" is the established generic name, brand names include "T-614," "Zyramod", and "Iguarti".


## How It Works

**Pharmacodynamics:** Iguratimod primarily acts by modifying the immune response and reducing inflammation. This involves suppressing the production of inflammatory mediators, potentially affecting T-cell activity, and modulating B-cell function and antibody production.  The inhibition of COX-2 contributes to its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:**  Iguratimod is administered orally and is well-absorbed. Food intake doesn't significantly impact its absorption.
* **Metabolism:** Hepatic metabolism via CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP3A4) yields several metabolites, some of which are active (e.g., deformatylated and N-acetylated forms).
* **Elimination:** Both renal and hepatic pathways contribute to elimination.


## Dosage


### Standard Dosage

#### Adults:

Initial dose is 25 mg once daily for the first week, then increased to 25 mg twice daily.  Maximum daily dose is 50 mg. Tablets should be swallowed whole with water and can be taken with or without food.

#### Children:

Limited information is available on pediatric use.  Consult a pediatric rheumatologist for guidance if considering Iguratimod in children. Dosage, growth, and open communication with caregivers should be carefully considered.

#### Special Cases:

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments might not be mandatory but close monitoring is recommended due to a potential for increased serious adverse events.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage modifications may be necessary. Close monitoring of renal function is advisable.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution and monitor liver function regularly.  Contraindicated in severe liver impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Pre-existing conditions (e.g., peptic ulcers, cardiovascular diseases) necessitate cautious use.



### Clinical Use Cases

Dosage recommendations for the specific scenarios you mentioned (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, emergency situations) are not explicitly defined for Iguratimod. Its primary indication is rheumatoid arthritis management.


### Dosage Adjustments

Dosage adjustments may be required based on factors such as renal or hepatic dysfunction. Monitoring of liver function tests is important.


## Side Effects

### Common Side Effects

Nausea, diarrhea, constipation, stomach pain, skin rash, dizziness, headache, itching, vomiting, loss of appetite, shortness of breath, dry cough.

### Rare but Serious Side Effects

Severe allergic reactions (rash, swelling, breathing difficulties), liver injury (e.g., elevated liver enzymes, jaundice), interstitial lung disease, blood dyscrasias (e.g., anemia, thrombocytopenia).

### Long-Term Effects

Potential long-term effects include chronic hepatic complications, mood changes, and respiratory symptoms.



### Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)

Severe hepatic dysfunction, serious allergic reactions, and blood disorders require immediate medical attention.

## Contraindications

Absolute contraindications include hypersensitivity to Iguratimod, severe liver impairment, and severe renal impairment. Relative contraindications include pregnancy and breastfeeding.

## Drug Interactions

Iguratimod can interact with:
* **Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin):** May enhance anticoagulant effect, increasing bleeding risk.
* **Immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine, methotrexate):** Careful monitoring needed to avoid cumulative immunosuppression and potential toxicity.
* **Potentially hepatotoxic medications (e.g., acetaminophen):** Increased risk of liver injury.
* **CYP enzyme inducers/inhibitors (e.g., rifampicin, ketoconazole):** Can alter Iguratimod metabolism and thus its effectiveness or side effects.
Other drugs that may potentially interact with Iguratimod include corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as the combination may increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects. 


## Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

The safety of Iguratimod during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been established.  It's generally advised to avoid its use in these populations unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Consult a doctor for guidance.

## Drug Profile Summary

* **Mechanism of Action:** Immunomodulator, COX-2 inhibitor, cytokine suppressor.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, diarrhea, skin rash, elevated liver enzymes, upper respiratory tract infections.  Rarely: serious liver reactions and allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Severe liver/renal impairment, hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:** Warfarin, immunosuppressants, hepatotoxic drugs, CYP modulators.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Not recommended unless absolutely necessary.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 25 mg once daily initially, increased to 25 mg twice daily; Max 50mg/day.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests, complete blood count.

## Popular Combinations

Iguratimod is sometimes used in combination with methotrexate in RA, but careful monitoring for side effects is essential.

## Precautions

* **General Precautions:**  Screen for allergies, liver/renal dysfunction.
* **Specific Populations:** Avoid in pregnancy/breastfeeding unless absolutely necessary.  Caution in elderly patients and children.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Limit alcohol. Avoid driving if experiencing dizziness or fatigue.
