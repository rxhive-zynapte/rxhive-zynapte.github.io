      was 600 mg of each, given via intravenous infusion or subcutaneous
      injection, but this medication is no longer in use.

      What is the mechanism of action of Imdevimab?**


      **A:** Imdevimab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the spike protein
      of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It was used in combination with casirivimab, as
      the two antibodies bound to different sites on the spike protein,
      preventing the virus from entering human cells. This is no longer
      effective.

      Why is Imdevimab no longer used?**


      **A:** Imdevimab and casirivimab are no longer effective against more
      recent circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2 such as Omicron.  Therefore,
      they are no longer authorized for use and no longer distributed.

Imdevimab is not available as a standalone drug. It is only authorized for use in combination with Casirivimab as REGEN-COV. This combination was initially authorized for emergency use but is no longer effective against prevalent variants of COVID-19, including Omicron. It should not be administered. Because this medication is no longer in use, the following information is outdated as of February 16, 2025 and intended for historical reference only.


## **Usage**

REGEN-COV was previously authorized for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in non-hospitalized adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.

- **Pharmacological classification:**  Monoclonal antibody (viral fusion inhibitor)

- **Mechanism of action:**  Casirivimab and Imdevimab are monoclonal antibodies that bind to distinct, non-overlapping epitopes on the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, thereby blocking the virus's attachment and entry into human cells.



## **Alternate Names** 

- **Combination with Casirivimab:** REGEN-COV, Ronapreve
- **Imdevimab alone:** REGN10987


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Casirivimab and Imdevimab work synergistically to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by preventing viral entry into host cells.  The combination was shown to reduce viral load and the risk of hospitalization or death in certain patient populations infected with early variants of COVID-19. This effect is no longer relevant given viral evolution.


- **Pharmacokinetics:** Both casirivimab and imdevimab exhibit linear pharmacokinetics following intravenous administration.  Subcutaneous administration shows a similar pharmacokinetic profile with slightly lower peak concentrations but comparable overall exposure.  Both antibodies are primarily eliminated via non-renal pathways, and metabolism by CYP enzymes is not anticipated.


- **Mode of action:** Receptor binding inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.


- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily non-renal clearance.  The exact metabolic pathways are not fully elucidated.



## **Dosage**


The following dosage information is outdated and provided for historical reference only, as REGEN-COV is no longer effective or used:

### **Standard Dosage**  
#### **Adults:**  
- 600 mg Casirivimab and 600 mg Imdevimab administered together as a single intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injection.


#### **Children:**  
- Same as adult dosing for children 12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg.
- Not recommended for children younger than 12 years of age or weighing less than 40 kg.
