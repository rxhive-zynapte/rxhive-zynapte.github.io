## **Usage**

- Imeglimin is prescribed for **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus** as an adjunct to diet and exercise. It can be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antidiabetic medications, including insulin.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antidiabetic agent; Glimin (a novel class of glucose-lowering agents).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Imeglimin has a multimodal mechanism of action targeting mitochondrial bioenergetics. It enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, improves insulin action (including reduction of hepatic glucose output and improvement in insulin signaling in liver and skeletal muscle), and decreases oxidative stress.

## **Alternate Names**

- Imeglimin Hydrochloride
- **Brand Names:** Twymeeg, Zuglimin, Imegli, Imeg CKD


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Imeglimin improves glycemic control by increasing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), improving insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, and inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis.  It achieves these effects by improving mitochondrial function.  It may also preserve β-cell mass. Imeglimin is glucose-dependent, minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Intermediate intestinal permeability with both active transport and passive paracellular absorption. Absorption can decrease with increasing doses, likely due to saturation of active transport. Bioavailability is estimated between 50-80%. Food may improve absorption.
    - **Distribution:** Rapid and wide distribution to internal organs, with low plasma protein binding.
    - **Metabolism:**  Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine, with minimal hepatic metabolism.  Does not inhibit or induce CYP450 enzymes.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion, with minimal hepatic involvement. It is a substrate of OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K transporters, and an inhibitor of OCT1, OCT2, and MATE1. However, no clinically significant drug-drug interactions are seen with substrates or inhibitors of these transporters.


- **Mode of Action:** Imeglimin targets mitochondrial dysfunction, a key factor in the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes.  It acts by:
    - Increasing glucose-stimulated ATP generation.
    - Increasing the synthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) via the salvage pathway, which enhances GSIS and decreases oxidative stress.
    - Preventing mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, which may protect against cell death.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 1000 mg orally twice daily (with morning and evening meals). Starting dose can be 500 mg twice daily.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and titrate upwards based on tolerability and efficacy. Monitor renal function closely.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustment is required. For patients with an eGFR between 15-45 mL/min/1.73m², the recommended dose is 500 mg twice daily.  Use is not recommended for patients with an eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73m².
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution, as imeglimin's blood concentration may increase.  Clinical trials have not been conducted in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh C).
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with heart failure. Close monitoring is advised.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

-  Imeglimin's usage is specifically indicated for type 2 diabetes management in conjunction with diet and exercise.  It is not currently indicated for acute settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
Adjustments are based on renal function and individual patient response.
