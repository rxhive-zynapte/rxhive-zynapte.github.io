## **Usage**

- Imidapril is prescribed for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure), congestive heart failure, and diabetic nephropathy (kidney damage caused by diabetes).  
- **Pharmacological classification:** Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Imidapril, a prodrug, is converted in the liver to its active metabolite, imidaprilat. Imidaprilat blocks the action of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which prevents the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor (narrows blood vessels) and also stimulates the release of aldosterone, which causes the body to retain sodium and water. By blocking the formation of angiotensin II, imidapril lowers blood pressure and reduces strain on the heart.

## **Alternate Names**

- Imidapril hydrochloride is the chemical name.
- **Brand Names:** Tanatril, Vascor, Prilium.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Imidapril lowers blood pressure by reducing peripheral vascular resistance (the resistance to blood flow in the arteries) without significantly altering heart rate or cardiac output. It improves renal blood flow and reduces proteinuria (protein in the urine) in patients with diabetic nephropathy.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Imidapril is well-absorbed after oral administration, is extensively metabolized by the liver to imidaprilat. Peak plasma concentration of imidaprilat is reached within 7 hours. It has a biphasic elimination half-life, with an initial half-life of 7-9 hours and terminal half-life exceeding 24 hours, reaching a steady-state concentration after 5 days of dosing. About 85% of imidapril and 53% of imidaprilat are protein bound. Elimination occurs through renal (40%) and hepatobiliary (50%) routes. Reduced renal function significantly impacts imidaprilat pharmacokinetics, necessitating dosage adjustments, while hepatic dysfunction only slightly impacts pharmacokinetics. Food, especially fatty meals, can decrease imidapril absorption.
- **Mode of Action:** Imidaprilat competitively binds to and inhibits ACE, reducing the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This leads to decreased vasoconstriction, reduced aldosterone secretion, and subsequently lower blood pressure and sodium retention.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal (40%) and hepatobiliary/fecal (50%) excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: 5 mg once daily, taken orally about 15 minutes before a meal.
