## **Usage**

Imipenem, administered in combination with Cilastatin, is a broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic indicated for the treatment of various bacterial infections, including:

* Lower respiratory tract infections
* Urinary tract infections
* Intra-abdominal infections
* Gynecological infections
* Skin and skin structure infections
* Bacterial septicemia
* Bone and joint infections
* Endocarditis

**Pharmacological Classification:** Carbapenem Antibiotic

**Mechanism of Action:** Imipenem exerts its bactericidal effect by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis through binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).  Cilastatin, a renal dehydropeptidase inhibitor, prevents the renal metabolism of Imipenem, thereby increasing its serum half-life and efficacy.

## **Alternate Names**

Imipenem is primarily known by its generic name.  It is most commonly administered in a fixed-dose combination with Cilastatin.

**Brand Names:** Primaxin IM, Primaxin IV, Recarbrio (in combination with Cilastatin and Relebactam).

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Imipenem's bactericidal action stems from its ability to irreversibly bind to PBPs, crucial enzymes involved in the final stages of peptidoglycan synthesis, a key component of the bacterial cell wall. This binding disrupts cell wall integrity, leading to bacterial cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Imipenem is administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). It exhibits rapid and complete absorption after IV administration.
* **Distribution:** Widely distributed throughout the body, including tissues and fluids.
* **Metabolism:** Imipenem is metabolized in the kidneys by dehydropeptidase I. Cilastatin effectively inhibits this metabolism, enhancing Imipenem's efficacy.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated renally, with approximately 70% excreted unchanged in the urine within 10 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Imipenem targets PBPs located on the inner bacterial cell membrane. Its binding to PBPs disrupts the transpeptidation and transglycosylation reactions essential for peptidoglycan cross-linking and elongation, ultimately leading to bacterial cell lysis and death.  

**Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **IV:** 250 mg to 1 g every 6 to 8 hours, infused over 20-30 minutes for doses ≤500 mg and 40-60 minutes for doses >500 mg. Maximum daily dose: 4 g or 50 mg/kg, whichever is lower.
* **IM:** 500 mg to 750 mg every 12 hours.

#### **Children (≥ 3 months):**

* 15-25 mg/kg every 6 hours IV. Maximum daily dose:  2 g for fully susceptible organisms or 4 g for moderately susceptible organisms.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is needed for patients with normal renal function. Monitor renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment is required. Consult specific guidelines based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is typically needed.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on infection severity and pathogen susceptibility.  Consult local guidelines and expert recommendations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are necessary based on renal function.  Consult specific guidelines based on creatinine clearance for appropriate dose reduction.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Pain, swelling, or redness at the injection site
* Rash

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Seizures
* Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, hives, difficulty breathing)
* *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea
* Bone marrow suppression (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia)
* Pseudomembranous colitis
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis
* Stevens-Johnson Syndrome

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

* Anaphylaxis requiring immediate intervention with epinephrine.
* Seizures requiring anticonvulsant therapy and discontinuation of Imipenem.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to Imipenem, Cilastatin, or other carbapenems.
* Hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins).

## **Drug Interactions**

* Valproic Acid/Divalproex Sodium: Decreased valproic acid levels and risk of seizures.
* Ganciclovir: Increased risk of seizures.
* Probenecid: Increased Imipenem serum concentrations.
* Anticoagulants (Warfarin): May enhance anticoagulant effects.  Careful monitoring is advised


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Use only if clearly needed. Risk Summary: Potential risks based on embryonic loss observed in animal studies. Insufficient data available on use in pregnant women.
* **Breastfeeding:**  LactMed considers use acceptable. However, weigh the benefits of breastfeeding against potential risks to the infant. Some sources do not recommend breastfeeding, or advise careful consideration of risks/benefits.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to PBPs.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, injection site reactions, rash; seizures, allergic reactions (rare but serious).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to Imipenem, Cilastatin, or beta-lactams.
* **Drug Interactions:** Valproic acid, ganciclovir, probenecid, anticoagulants.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; potential risks to the fetus and neonate.
* **Dosage:**  See dosage section for details.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, signs of hypersensitivity, complete blood count, liver function tests.

## **Popular Combinations**

Imipenem/Cilastatin is often used alone. The addition of other antibiotics is generally not recommended due to the broad spectrum of Imipenem.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess renal function before and during therapy. Monitor for signs of hypersensitivity.  
* **Specific Populations:**  See Special Cases under Dosage.
