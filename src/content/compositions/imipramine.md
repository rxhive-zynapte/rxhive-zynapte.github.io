## **Usage**

- Imipramine is primarily prescribed for the treatment of various forms of depression, including major depressive disorder, and nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting) in children.  Off-label uses include the management of panic disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), chronic and neuropathic pain (including diabetic neuropathy), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Tricyclic Antidepressant (TCA)
- **Mechanism of Action:** Imipramine primarily inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in the synaptic cleft, increasing their concentration and enhancing neurotransmission.  It also exhibits anticholinergic, antihistaminic, and alpha-adrenolytic properties, although these are not its primary therapeutic actions.

## **Alternate Names**

- International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Imipramine
- **Brand Names:** Tofranil, Tofranil-PM, Pr-Imipramine, JAMP-Imipramine

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Imipramine enhances serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission by inhibiting their reuptake in the presynaptic neuron.  The increase in these neurotransmitters within the synaptic cleft is thought to be responsible for its antidepressant effect. Its anticholinergic effects can lead to dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and urinary retention.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Imipramine is well-absorbed after oral administration.
    - **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 enzymes, to its active metabolite, desipramine. Genetic polymorphisms in these enzymes can affect drug levels and efficacy.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily excreted in urine as metabolites.  The elimination half-life is variable, ranging from 9 to 25 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Binds to presynaptic reuptake transporters for serotonin and norepinephrine, inhibiting their reuptake into the neuron. This increases the concentration of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft.  Imipramine also exhibits some receptor-binding activity, including antagonism of histamine H1 receptors, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and alpha-adrenergic receptors.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Hepatic metabolism via CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, followed by renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (Depression):**

- **Outpatients:** Initially, 75 mg orally per day, increased gradually to 150-200 mg/day as needed. Maximum dose: 200 mg/day. Doses may be given in divided doses or as a single dose at bedtime.
- **Hospitalized Patients:** Initially, 100-150 mg orally per day, increased gradually to 200 mg/day. If no response after two weeks, the dose can be further increased to 250-300 mg/day (maximum). May be given in divided doses or as a single bedtime dose.
- **Maintenance:** 50-100 mg orally per day.

#### **Children (Enuresis):**

- 6 years and older: Initially, 25 mg orally per day 1 hour before bedtime.  If needed, the dose can be increased weekly in increments of 25 mg. Maximum dose: 2.5 mg/kg/day or the maximum dose for the age group, whichever is less.
- Younger than 6 years: Not recommended.
- Maximum treatment duration for enuresis: 3 months.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initially, 10 mg orally per day, gradually increased to 30-50 mg/day. Maximum: 100 mg/day.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Data limited.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Data limited; contraindicated in severe impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Close monitoring is necessary in patients with cardiovascular disease, seizure disorders, glaucoma, urinary retention, or those receiving other medications.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Imipramine does not have standard dosage guidelines specifically for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  In such clinical settings, the drug is generally not indicated or only used cautiously when the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- **Renal/Hepatic Impairment:** Exercise caution. Adjust dose based on individual patient response.
- **Metabolic Disorders/Genetic Polymorphisms:** Consider CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 polymorphisms. Reduce dose in poor metabolizers. Therapeutic drug monitoring may be beneficial.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, nausea, weight gain, tremor.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, orthostatic hypotension, serotonin syndrome, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, agranulocytosis, jaundice.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Tardive dyskinesia (rare).


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Serotonin syndrome, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, severe cardiac arrhythmias, agranulocytosis.

## **Contraindications**

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (older categorization system).  Weigh risks and benefits.  Limited human data; potential for fetal harm.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Imipramine is excreted in breast milk.  Neonatal side effects are possible. Consider alternative safer options or monitor infant closely.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake.
- **Side Effects:** Dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, drowsiness, dizziness. Serious: cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, serotonin syndrome.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, recent MI, concomitant MAOI use, severe hepatic impairment.
- **Drug Interactions:** MAOIs, CYP450 inhibitors/inducers, CNS depressants.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; weigh risks and benefits.

## **Popular Combinations**

- It is not common practice to combine imipramine with other antidepressants. Generally, combination with other drugs is not recommended unless it is specifically indicated and under strict monitoring by a doctor.


## **Precautions**
