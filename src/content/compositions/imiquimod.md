## **Usage**

Imiquimod is prescribed for the topical treatment of several skin conditions:

*   **Actinic keratosis (AK):** Precancerous skin lesions caused by sun exposure.
*   **Superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC):** A common type of skin cancer.
*   **External genital and perianal warts:** Warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV).

**Pharmacological Classification:** Immune response modifier.

**Mechanism of Action:** Imiquimod is an immune response modifier that activates toll-like receptors 7 and 8, leading to the production of interferon-alpha and other cytokines. This stimulates the body's immune system to recognize and destroy the affected cells.


## **Alternate Names**

While Imiquimod is the generic name, it is marketed under various brand names, notably Aldara and Zyclara. There are no widely recognized international or regional variations of the name.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Imiquimod acts by stimulating the innate immune system, causing localized inflammation and promoting the destruction of abnormal cells.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Minimally absorbed through the skin, with less than 1% reaching systemic circulation. Systemic absorption is greater with application to larger areas.
*   **Metabolism:**  The exact metabolic pathway is not fully understood, but a small portion is metabolized in the liver.
*   **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:**  Imiquimod binds to toll-like receptors 7 and 8 on immune cells, specifically plasmacytoid dendritic cells and Langerhans cells, within the skin.  This binding triggers a cascade of intracellular signaling, resulting in the production of cytokines like interferon-alpha, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-6. These cytokines mediate the anti-viral and anti-tumor effects of imiquimod. 

**Receptor Binding:** Toll-like receptors 7 and 8.

**Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Not a primary mechanism of action for imiquimod.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion, with minimal hepatic metabolism.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   **Actinic Keratosis:** Apply a thin layer once daily to the affected area before bedtime, 2 times per week (doses 3-4 days apart), for 16 weeks.
*   **Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma:** Apply 5 times per week for 6 weeks.
*   **External Genital/Perianal Warts:** Apply a thin layer once daily, 3 times per week (every other day), before bedtime for up to 16 weeks.

#### **Children:**

Use in children under 12 years of age for genital/perianal warts or under 18 for other conditions is not recommended as efficacy and safety have not been established.  For some off-label uses in children, physician should determine dosing.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustment is necessary.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution, and dose adjustment might be necessary in severe impairment.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution; however, limited systemic absorption suggests minimal hepatic impact.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised for patients with autoimmune diseases or compromised immune systems.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Imiquimod is not indicated for Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, or Emergency Situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with severe renal impairment.  Dosage may also need to be adjusted for hypersensitivity.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Local skin reactions (erythema, edema, erosion, flaking/scaling, itching, burning, pain). Headache, fatigue, influenza-like symptoms.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe local skin reactions (ulceration, weeping, blistering).  New or worsening psoriasis, vitiligo or other autoimmune conditions.



### **Long-Term Effects:**

Changes in skin pigmentation (hypo- or hyperpigmentation) at the application site can occur.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe local skin reactions requiring discontinuation of treatment and appropriate medical management.


## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to imiquimod or any component of the formulation.
*   Pre-existing autoimmune diseases, particularly affecting the skin, should be carefully considered.
*   Application to broken or inflamed skin.
*   Hypersensitivity to benzyl alcohol or parabens.



## **Drug Interactions**

No formal drug interaction studies have been performed. Minimal systemic absorption suggests limited potential for interactions. Caution is advised with concomitant use of other topical medications or immunosuppressants.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

*   **Pregnancy:**  Pregnancy Category C. Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.
*   **Breastfeeding:** It is unknown if imiquimod is excreted in breast milk.  Avoid applying to the breast area, ensuring the infant does not come into contact with treated skin.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** Toll-like receptor 7 and 8 agonist, stimulating cytokine production.
*   **Side Effects:** Local skin reactions, headache, fatigue.
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe autoimmune conditions.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Limited data available, minimal systemic absorption.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
*   **Dosage:** Varies depending on indication, generally 3 times per week or once daily.
*   **Monitoring Parameters:** Observe for local skin reactions and any signs of systemic effects.



## **Popular Combinations**

Imiquimod is generally used as monotherapy. There are no established "popular combinations" with other drugs.

## **Precautions**

*   **General Precautions:** Evaluate for pre-existing skin conditions, autoimmune disorders, or hypersensitivity.
*   **Pregnant Women:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
*   **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Avoid breast application; prevent infant contact with treated areas.
*   **Children & Elderly:** Pediatric use is limited; no specific geriatric precautions.
