## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV, IIV3, IIV4, HD-IIV3, HD-IIV4, ccIIV3, ccIIV4, RIV3, RIV4, aIIV3, aIIV4) are prescribed for the prevention of influenza (flu) infection.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Vaccine.
- **Mechanism of Action:** These vaccines contain inactivated (killed) influenza viruses.  They work by exposing the body to small amounts of inactivated viral antigens (hemagglutinin and neuraminidase), stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies.  These antibodies then provide protection against future infection with the same or similar strains of influenza virus.

## **Alternate Names**

- Flu shot
- Flu vaccine (inactivated)
- Trivalent influenza vaccine (IIV3)
- Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV4)
- High-dose trivalent influenza vaccine (HD-IIV3)
- High-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (HD-IIV4)
- Cell-culture based IIV3/IIV4
- Recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV3/RIV4)
- Adjuvanted IIV3/IIV4

- **Brand names:** Fluzone, Fluarix, FluLaval, FluMist (note, FluMist is a live attenuated vaccine), Flucelvax, Flublok, Fluad, Afluria.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  The inactivated influenza vaccine stimulates the immune system, specifically humoral immunity, producing antibodies targeting the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase surface proteins of the influenza virus. The antibodies bind to the virus and neutralize it, hence preventing its entry into the body’s cells.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  The vaccine is administered intramuscularly (IM) or intradermally (ID), the antigens are processed by antigen-presenting cells, and an immune response is initiated. Antibody titers typically peak within 2 weeks of vaccination. Data on the specific metabolism and elimination of inactivated influenza virus antigens are limited.
- **Mode of Action/Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** The inactivated virus particles do not replicate or cause infection.  The hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens are recognized by the immune system as foreign, triggering B cells to differentiate into antibody-producing plasma cells. The primary mechanism is antibody-mediated neutralization.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Specific data on the elimination pathways of inactivated viral antigens are not readily available.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 0.5 mL IM, annually. Adults 65 years and older should preferentially receive HD-IIV3, RIV3, aIIV3, or aIIV4.
- HD-IIV3/HD-IIV4, RIV3/RIV4, aIIV3/aIIV4: 0.5 mL IM annually, preferentially for adults 65 years and older.
- ID Fluzone Intradermal Quadrivalent (for ages 18-64): 0.1ml intradermally. 

#### **Children:**

- **6-35 months:**
    - Fluzone, Afluria: 0.25 mL or 0.5 mL IM.
    - Fluarix, FluLaval, Flucelvax: 0.5 mL IM.
- **3-17 years:** 0.5 mL IM
- **Children aged 6 months through 8 years receiving influenza vaccine for the first time:** Two doses (0.25ml or 0.5ml, depending on product and age), administered at least 4 weeks apart.
- If a child turns 9 years of age between doses, the second dose should still be administered.
- A second dose is needed for a 9-year-old child who received one dose in the current season while they were age 8 years, if they have not or don't know if they have received 2 doses in prior years.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients (65 years and older):**  Preferentially HD-IIV, RIV, or aIIV, 0.5ml IM dose. If none are available, any age-appropriate IIV or RIV may be used.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are not typically necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments are not typically necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Standard dosing is generally appropriate, but certain conditions may influence vaccine choice (e.g. immunocompromised patients). Live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is contraindicated in some patients with chronic medical conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  These vaccines are for the *prevention* of influenza, not treatment or emergency use, and hence are not indicated in the following scenarios.

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations**

### **Dosage Adjustments**  Standard dosing is generally appropriate unless otherwise stated.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
- Injection site reactions (soreness, redness, swelling)
- Headache
- Myalgia
- Fatigue
- Fever
- Chills

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
- Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis (rare)
- Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) (very rare)

### **Long-Term Effects:** No significant long-term adverse effects are associated with inactivated influenza vaccines.



## **Contraindications:**

- Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine or to any vaccine component (excluding egg protein for most vaccines).
- History of GBS within 6 weeks of a previous influenza vaccination, with no other identified cause.

## **Drug Interactions:**

- Immunosuppressant medications: may reduce immune response to vaccine
- Antiviral medications (e.g., oseltamivir, zanamivir): Administer LAIV 2 weeks before or 48 hours after the antiviral medications. Administer LAIV 17 days before or 2 weeks after baloxavir and 5 days before or 2 weeks after peramivir.
- Aspirin and salicylates: Not recommended for children/adolescents for 4 weeks after vaccination due to risk of Reye’s syndrome.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:**

- **Pregnancy:** Recommended during any trimester.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Generally considered safe.  Antibodies generated by the mother can be passed to the infant through breast milk, providing potential passive immunity.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Stimulates antibody production against influenza virus antigens.
- **Side Effects:** Injection site reactions, headache, myalgia, fever, chills. Rarely, allergic reactions or GBS.
- **Contraindications:** Severe allergic reaction to a previous dose or vaccine component (excluding egg for most vaccines), history of GBS.
