## Usage

- **Medical Conditions:** Inactivated Japanese Encephalitis virus protein vaccines are prescribed for the prevention of Japanese encephalitis (JE). JE is a mosquito-borne viral infection that can cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis).  The vaccine is recommended for travelers to endemic areas, especially those visiting rural areas during transmission season, laboratory workers handling the JE virus, and individuals residing in regions where JE is endemic or epidemic.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Vaccine, Viral, Inactivated.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  The inactivated JE vaccine works by stimulating the body's immune system to produce antibodies against the Japanese Encephalitis virus without causing the disease. These antibodies provide active immunity and protect against future JE infection.


## Alternate Names

- Inactivated Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine
- Purified Inactivated Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine
- JE-VAX (older, mouse brain-derived, no longer available in many regions)
- IXIARO (cell-culture derived)
- JEEV
- JENVAC

## How It Works

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The vaccine introduces inactivated JE virus particles to the body. These particles cannot cause infection but retain the antigenic properties that trigger an immune response. The immune system recognizes the viral proteins as foreign and initiates a process to produce specific antibodies. These antibodies neutralize the JE virus upon natural encounter, thus preventing the disease.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** The vaccine is administered intramuscularly (IM). After injection, the inactivated virus particles are processed by antigen-presenting cells, leading to the activation of B lymphocytes and the production of antibodies. The peak antibody response is typically reached within a few weeks after the completion of the primary series.  The precise kinetics of antibody production, distribution, and elimination may vary slightly depending on the specific vaccine used.
- **Mode of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  The vaccine itself does not bind to receptors, inhibit enzymes, or modulate neurotransmitters. Its mode of action is solely immunological, relying on antibody production to neutralize the virus in the event of subsequent infection.
- **Elimination Pathways:** The inactivated virus particles and subsequently produced antibodies are eliminated through normal physiological processes, predominantly through the reticuloendothelial system and renal clearance.

## Dosage


### Standard Dosage

#### Adults (18-65 years):

- Two doses of 0.5 mL each, administered intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle.
- **Standard Schedule:** First dose on Day 0, second dose 28 days later.
- **Rapid Schedule (for some vaccines):** First dose on Day 0, second dose 7 days later (consult product information).
- **Booster Dose:** May be given 12-24 months after primary immunization if ongoing exposure or re-exposure is expected. Subsequent boosters may be recommended depending on the individual's risk profile and the local epidemiology.

#### Children (2 months and above):

- Dosing depends on age and specific vaccine formulation. Check approved product information for details. 
- IXIARO is not recommended for children under 18 years of age.
- Other vaccines have approved schedules starting from 2 months of age (consult specific product information).


#### Special Cases:

- **Elderly Patients (â‰¥65 years):** Two doses of 0.5 mL, 28 days apart, as per the standard adult schedule.  A booster dose should be considered due to potentially lower immune response in older adults.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustment is typically required. 
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustment is typically required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific contraindications exist for most comorbid conditions, but individual cases should be assessed for suitability.

### Clinical Use Cases

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical settings are typically the same as the standard adult or pediatric dosing. The decision to vaccinate will be based on the individual's risk assessment. For pre-exposure prophylaxis, vaccination should ideally be completed at least one week before potential exposure to the virus.

### Dosage Adjustments

- **Renal/Hepatic Dysfunction:** Generally, no dose modifications are needed.
- **Metabolic Disorders:** No specific dose adjustments are generally required, but individual cases should be assessed for suitability.
- **Genetic Polymorphisms:** No currently known genetic polymorphisms necessitate dose modifications.

## Side Effects

### Common Side Effects

- Local reactions: Pain, tenderness, redness, and swelling at the injection site.
- Systemic reactions: Headache, myalgia, fatigue, fever, nausea, malaise.

### Rare but Serious Side Effects

- Severe allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis).
- Neurological events (rare).

### Long-Term Effects

No long-term adverse effects from the currently available inactivated JE vaccines are known.

### Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)

Clinically significant ADRs are rare. Any serious or unexpected adverse events should be reported to relevant authorities (e.g., Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System).


## Contraindications

- Hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine (including the active ingredient, excipients, residual materials from vaccine production like protamine sulfate or formaldehyde).
- History of severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of JE vaccine.


## Drug Interactions

Limited data on specific drug interactions are available.  However, it is advisable to administer the JE vaccine with separate syringes and at different injection sites from other injectable vaccines. Co-administration with other medications should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.


## Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

- **Pregnancy:** The JE vaccine is not routinely recommended during pregnancy unless there is a high risk of exposure to JE. The benefits and risks must be carefully evaluated on an individual basis.  Pregnant women should consult their doctor if they are planning travel to a JE endemic area.
- **Breastfeeding:**  No specific data on safety during breastfeeding are available, but the use is generally considered safe.

## Drug Profile Summary

- **Mechanism of Action:** Stimulates antibody production to neutralize the JE virus.
- **Side Effects:** Common: injection site reactions (pain, swelling, redness), headache, fever, myalgia, fatigue. Rare: allergic reactions, neurological events.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to vaccine components; prior severe allergic reaction to JE vaccine.
- **Drug Interactions:** Limited data, separate administration recommended for other injectable vaccines.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Not routinely recommended in pregnancy unless high risk; use with caution in breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** Adults: two 0.5 mL doses, 28 days apart (or a rapid 7-day schedule for some vaccines). Pediatric dosage varies; consult specific product information.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Observe patient for any adverse reactions after administration, particularly allergic reactions.


## Popular Combinations

The JE vaccine may be given concomitantly with other travel vaccines according to recommended schedules, but they should be administered at different sites with separate syringes.

## Precautions

- **General Precautions:** Screen for contraindications before administration.
- **Specific Populations:** Evaluate benefits and risks for pregnant/breastfeeding women, patients with immune system disorders, and those with a history of allergic reactions to vaccines.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** No specific lifestyle restrictions after vaccination.
