# Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV)

## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) is prescribed for the prevention of poliomyelitis (polio), a highly contagious viral disease that can cause paralysis and even death.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Vaccine (viral).
- **Mechanism of Action:** IPV contains inactivated (killed) poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types. Upon administration, the vaccine stimulates the body's immune system to produce antibodies against poliovirus, thereby providing immunity without causing the disease.

## **Alternate Names**

- **Alternate Names:** IPOL, Poliovax
- **Brand Names:**  Imovax® Polio, IPOL

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** IPV works by inducing an active immune response against poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3. This immune response is mediated by the production of neutralizing antibodies that prevent the virus from infecting nerve cells.  
- **Pharmacokinetics:** The inactivated poliovirus antigens in IPV are primarily absorbed at the injection site (intramuscular or subcutaneous) and processed by antigen-presenting cells. It is not a live virus, so it does not replicate in the body. The elimination pathways of the inactivated viral particles and the generated antibodies are not specifically defined.
- **Mode of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  IPV does not directly bind to receptors, inhibit enzymes, or modulate neurotransmitters.  Its mechanism of action relies on triggering an immune response.  The specific immune mechanisms involve activation of B cells and T helper cells, leading to the production of poliovirus-specific antibodies, primarily IgG.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (Primary Vaccination):**

* Three doses of 0.5 mL:
    * Dose 1: At any time.
    * Dose 2: 1-2 months after Dose 1.
    * Dose 3: 6-12 months after Dose 2.

#### **Adults (Booster):** A single booster dose of 0.5 mL is recommended for adults at increased risk of exposure to poliovirus every 10 years.  Increased risk includes travelers to endemic areas, healthcare workers, and laboratory personnel handling poliovirus.

#### **Children:**
* Four doses of 0.5 mL:
    * Dose 1: 2 months of age
    * Dose 2: 4 months of age
    * Dose 3: 6-18 months of age
    * Dose 4: 4-6 years of age

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Follow adult dosing guidelines.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific dose adjustments are outlined for comorbid conditions, but individual patient factors should be considered.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

IPV is administered for routine immunization and is not indicated for specific clinical situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific dose adjustments are required based on renal/hepatic function, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
* Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site
* Mild fever

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
* Allergic reactions (e.g., hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face) – Requires immediate medical attention.

### **Long-Term Effects:** No long-term adverse effects associated with IPV have been reported.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** Anaphylaxis (rare but requires immediate intervention).


## **Contraindications**

* History of severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of IPV or any of its components (neomycin, streptomycin, polymyxin B).

## **Drug Interactions**

* Immunosuppressants (e.g., ofatumumab, secukinumab) can reduce the immune response to IPV.  Vaccination should ideally be completed at least two weeks before initiating immunosuppressive therapy.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  IPV is generally avoided during pregnancy unless there is a clear risk of polio exposure. If vaccination is necessary, it can be given according to the standard adult schedule.
* **Breastfeeding:**  IPV is considered safe to administer during breastfeeding.  It is not known if IPV is excreted in breast milk.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Stimulates active immunity against poliovirus.
* **Side Effects:**  Generally mild, including injection site reactions and fever.  Rarely, allergic reactions can occur.
* **Contraindications:**  Hypersensitivity to vaccine components.
* **Drug Interactions:** Immunosuppressants.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe in breastfeeding; use with caution during pregnancy if indicated.
* **Dosage:** See detailed dosage guidelines above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for allergic reactions after administration.

## **Popular Combinations**

IPV is often given in combination with other vaccines, such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, and *Haemophilus influenzae* type b, based on the recommended childhood immunization schedule.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Screen for contraindications before administration.
* **Specific Populations:** See Pregnancy and Breastfeeding section.  No specific precautions for elderly, children, or menstruating individuals besides the standard dosing guidelines.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** No specific lifestyle considerations.
