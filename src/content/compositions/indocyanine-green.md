      Can ICG be administered to patients with shellfish allergies?**


      **A:** While ICG contains iodine, it's different from the allergens in
      shellfish.  However, use caution in patients with any iodine or iodide
      allergy due to the potential for cross-reactivity.

      What are the signs and symptoms of an ICG allergic reaction?**


      **A:** Allergic reactions can range from mild (itching, hives) to severe
      (anaphylaxis).  Signs and symptoms may include skin rash, itching,
      swelling (especially of the face, lips, or tongue), difficulty breathing,

      **A:** Monitor patients closely for allergic reactions, particularly
      during and immediately after administration. Observe vital signs and
      maintain readily available resuscitation equipment.  For specific clinical
      applications, monitor the relevant physiological parameters (e.g., cardiac
      output during indicator-dilution studies).

## **Usage**

Indocyanine Green (ICG) is a diagnostic aid used for:

* **Determining cardiac output:** Used in indicator-dilution studies during cardiac catheterization.
* **Assessing hepatic function:** Evaluates liver function by measuring the rate of ICG clearance from the bloodstream.
* **Ophthalmic angiography:** Visualizes the choroidal and retinal vasculature.
* **Intraoperative imaging:** Assesses blood flow and tissue perfusion in various surgical procedures, including vascular, gastrointestinal, organ transplant, plastic, micro, and reconstructive surgeries.  It can also be used to visualize extrahepatic biliary ducts, and for lymphatic mapping in cervical and uterine cancer.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Diagnostic agent, specifically a tricarbocyanine dye.

**Mechanism of Action:** ICG is administered intravenously and remains within the vascular compartment due to its binding to plasma proteins. It is not metabolized and is eliminated exclusively by the liver through biliary excretion. ICG fluoresces in near-infrared light, enabling visualization of blood vessels and blood flow.

## **Alternate Names**

* IC-Green
* Cardio Green
* Spy Agent Green
* VERDYE

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** ICG's primary effect is fluorescence upon excitation with near-infrared light, allowing visualization of blood vessels, blood flow, and tissue perfusion.  It does not have significant pharmacological activity beyond its diagnostic properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Administered intravenously and binds rapidly (98%) to plasma proteins, predominantly albumin.
* **Distribution:** Remains primarily within the intravascular compartment. Negligible distribution to renal, peripheral, lung, or cerebrospinal fluid.
* **Metabolism:** Not metabolized.
* **Elimination:** Excreted unchanged in the bile. Hepatic clearance is the primary route of elimination.  No enterohepatic circulation occurs.

**Mode of Action:** ICG's fluorescence properties are due to its tricarbocyanine structure. It absorbs light at specific wavelengths and emits light at slightly longer wavelengths, making it useful for imaging. It does not bind to specific receptors, inhibit enzymes, or modulate neurotransmitters.

**Elimination Pathways:** Hepatic excretion via the bile is the sole elimination pathway. No significant renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Cardiac Output:** 5 mg IV bolus, followed by a saline flush. Multiple doses may be given. Maximum 2 mg/kg.
* **Hepatic Function:** 0.5 mg/kg IV bolus.
* **Ophthalmic Angiography:** Up to 40 mg IV bolus, followed by a saline flush.
* **Intraoperative Imaging (Vessels, Blood Flow, Tissue Perfusion):** 1.25 mg to 5 mg IV. Maximum 2 mg/kg.
* **Intraoperative Imaging (Extremities Perfusion):** 3.75 to 10 mg IV. Maximum 2 mg/kg.
* **Visualization of Extrahepatic Biliary Ducts:** 2.5 mg IV at least 45 minutes before surgery. Additional doses may be given. Maximum 2 mg/kg.
* **Lymphatic Mapping:** 5 mg (1.25 mg/mL solution) interstitial injection into the cervix (four 1 mL injections).

#### **Children:**

* **Cardiac Output:** Infants: 1.25 mg IV. Children: 2.5 mg IV. Maximum 2 mg/kg.
* **Hepatic Function:** Same as adult dose (0.5 mg/kg).
* **Intraoperative Imaging (Vessels, Blood Flow, Tissue Perfusion):** 1.25 to 5 mg IV. Lower doses may be given in younger patients and those with lower body weight. Maximum 2 mg/kg.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Exercise caution due to potential age-related organ dysfunction. Adjust dose as needed.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically necessary due to hepatic elimination.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Reduced ICG clearance may occur. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient factors and adjust dosage accordingly.


### **Clinical Use Cases** (Dosages provided above in Standard Dosages and Special Cases sections).
