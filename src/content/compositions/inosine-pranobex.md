## **Usage**

Inosine pranobex is an antiviral and immunomodulatory agent.  It is prescribed as an adjunct for various viral infections including:

* **Mucocutaneous herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections (types 1 and 2):**  Used in conjunction with other treatments.
* **Genital warts:**  As an adjunct to podophyllin or carbon dioxide laser therapy.
* **Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE):** May help retard neurological deterioration.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Antiviral, immunomodulatory agent.

**Mechanism of Action:** Inosine pranobex has a dual mechanism:

1. **Enhances immune response:** Stimulates T-lymphocyte and macrophage activity and influences cytokine production.  This helps restore and normalize cell-mediated immunity.
2. **Direct antiviral effect:** May inhibit viral replication by interfering with viral RNA and protein synthesis.



## **Alternate Names**

* **Inosine acedoben dimepranol**
* **Isoprinosine** (Brand name)
* **Methisoprinol** (Brand name)
* **Imunovir** (Brand name)
* **Groprinosin** (Brand name)
* **Isojol** (Brand name)
* **Primunovir** (Brand Name)
* **Inosiplex** (Brand Name)
* **Viruxan Forte** (Brand Name)
* **Viruxan Kids** (Brand Name)
* **Inosipranol** (Brand Name)




## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Inosine pranobex enhances cell-mediated immunity by stimulating T-lymphocyte differentiation and proliferation and increasing macrophage activity. It also modulates cytokine production, contributing to a balanced immune response. The drug's direct antiviral effects may involve inhibition of viral RNA and protein synthesis.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
* **Metabolism:** Inosine is metabolized to uric acid.  The p-acetamidobenzoic acid component is primarily metabolized to O-acylglucuronide, while N,N-dimethylamino-2-propanol is mainly metabolized to N,N-dimethylamino-2-propanol-N-oxide.
* **Excretion:** Metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine within 24 hours.

**Mode of Action:**  Influences lymphocyte function,  enhances cytokine production, and may directly affect viral RNA and protein synthesis.

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, neurotransmitter modulation:** Specific details on receptor interactions or enzyme inhibition are not well-defined in the literature.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* 50-100 mg/kg/day, up to a maximum of 3-4 g/day, divided into 3-4 doses.
* Example: 1 gram (two 500 mg tablets) three to four times daily.

#### **Children:**

* 50 mg/kg/day, up to a maximum of 3-4 g/day, divided into 3-4 doses.
* Dosage may be adjusted based on weight and severity of the condition.
* For liquid formulations: 1 ml/kg per day in 3-4 divided doses

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Close monitoring of uric acid levels and renal function is advised. Dose adjustment may be needed based on organ function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution and monitor uric acid levels. Dose reduction might be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Close monitoring of liver function tests.  Dose adjustment might be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions (Gout, Hyperuricemia):**  Use cautiously as inosine pranobex increases uric acid levels.  Close monitoring of uric acid levels essential.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosage guidelines provided above apply across clinical settings.  Specific dosage recommendations for clinical cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use may need to be individualized based on the patientâ€™s specific situation and condition.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**
Dose modifications based on renal/hepatic dysfunction, other metabolic disorders, or genetic variations need to be determined by the treating physician according to the patient's condition.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

* Increased uric acid levels in blood and urine (usually transient).
* Nausea, vomiting
* Gastrointestinal discomfort
* Headache, dizziness
* Fatigue, malaise
