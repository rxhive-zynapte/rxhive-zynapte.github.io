## **Usage**

Inositol nicotinate is primarily prescribed to improve peripheral blood flow in conditions like intermittent claudication (leg pain during exercise due to poor circulation) and Raynaud's phenomenon (fingers and toes turning white and numb in the cold).  It has also been investigated for its potential in managing dyslipidemia (high cholesterol and triglycerides), though further research is required to determine its efficacy in this aspect. Its pharmacological classifications include vasodilator (widening of blood vessels), lipid-lowering agent, and a form of vitamin B3 (niacin).

The mechanism of action involves the release of niacin in the body. Niacin promotes vasodilation by stimulating the release of histamine, leading to the widening of blood vessels. This improved blood flow can alleviate symptoms associated with circulatory problems. The niacin component also influences lipid metabolism, aiding in reducing cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

## **Alternate Names**

* Inositol hexaniacinate
* Inositol hexanicotinate
* Hexanicit
* IHN
* "No-flush" niacin (though this claim is unsubstantiated)

Brand names include Hexopal and Nicofuranose.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Inositol nicotinate is a prodrug for niacin (vitamin B3). Once ingested, it is metabolized in the liver to release niacin and inositol. Niacin causes vasodilation by releasing histamine, widening blood vessels and improving blood flow. It also affects lipid metabolism, lowering cholesterol and triglyceride levels, especially VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein) and LDL (low-density lipoprotein), while potentially increasing HDL (high-density lipoprotein). Inositol, a sugar alcohol, might play a role in cell signaling and other metabolic processes, but its exact function in inositol nicotinate's effect isn't entirely understood.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Inositol nicotinate is administered orally, typically with food to reduce gastrointestinal side effects.  It's metabolized in the liver to niacin and inositol. The exact absorption and metabolism rates are not well-defined. Elimination pathways are likely primarily renal and hepatic, but specifics aren't extensively studied.


## **Dosage**

Dosage guidelines for inositol nicotinate vary depending on the condition and individual patient characteristics.  Since comprehensive clinical data isn't readily available, the following guidelines are based on existing studies and product information.


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

For peripheral vascular diseases like intermittent claudication, the typical dosage range is 1500-4000 mg per day, divided into 2-4 doses, usually taken with meals.

#### **Children:**

The safety and efficacy of inositol nicotinate in children haven't been established, thus it's generally not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and adjust cautiously according to response and tolerance.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution due to potential liver-related side effects.  Monitor liver function tests.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advisable in patients with diabetes (may increase blood sugar), gallbladder disease, gout, stomach ulcers, or bleeding disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Specific dosage recommendations for settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations are not established.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments might be necessary depending on patient response and tolerance.  Monitor closely for side effects, especially in those with liver or kidney conditions.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

* Flushing
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Stomach upset
* Flatulence
* Diarrhea
* Itching


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Liver damage (hepatotoxicity)
* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Fainting (syncope)
* Irregular heartbeat


### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term effects aren't well documented. Monitoring of liver function is recommended during prolonged therapy.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions (rash, itching, hives), significant hypotension, liver toxicity, and severe gastrointestinal effects require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to inositol nicotinate or niacin
* Active liver disease
* Severe hypotension
* Recent heart attack or stroke
* Active peptic ulcer disease



## **Drug Interactions**

* **Anticoagulants/Antiplatelet drugs (e.g., warfarin, clopidogrel, aspirin):** Increased risk of bleeding.
* **Statins (e.g., atorvastatin, simvastatin):** Increased risk of muscle problems (myopathy, rhabdomyolysis).
* **Antidiabetic drugs:** May reduce the effectiveness of these medications due to increased blood sugar levels.
* **Antihypertensive medications:** May enhance blood pressure-lowering effects, leading to hypotension.
* **Nicotine patch:** May increase the risk of flushing and dizziness.
* **Alcohol:** May worsen dizziness and increase the risk of liver problems.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of inositol nicotinate during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been adequately established. It's generally recommended to avoid use unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Vasodilation by histamine release, lipid-lowering effects.
* **Side Effects:** Flushing, dizziness, headache, nausea, stomach upset, liver toxicity (rare).
* **Contraindications:**  Liver disease, severe hypotension, recent heart attack or stroke.
* **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, statins, antidiabetic drugs, antihypertensives.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid unless absolutely necessary.
* **Dosage:** 1500-4000 mg/day for intermittent claudication, divided doses.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Liver function tests, blood pressure, blood glucose (in diabetics).


## **Popular Combinations**


Limited data exists on popular combinations, but concomitant use of aspirin might reduce flushing, although with potential gastrointestinal risks.


## **Precautions**

* Screen for allergies, liver/kidney disease, and relevant medical conditions.
* Caution in pregnant/breastfeeding women.
* Not typically recommended for children.
* Monitor blood sugar in diabetic patients.
* Limit alcohol consumption.
* Advise against driving or operating machinery if dizziness occurs.
