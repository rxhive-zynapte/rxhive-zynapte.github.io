## **Usage**

- Inotuzumab ozogamicin is prescribed for adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).  This includes Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) or Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-)  ALL. It is also used in patients who have not responded to other treatments or whose ALL has returned after treatment.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antineoplastic agent, Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Inotuzumab ozogamacin is an antibody-drug conjugate that targets the CD22 antigen found on B-cells. The antibody component, inotuzumab, binds to CD22 on the surface of leukemia cells. This binding triggers internalization of the conjugate, releasing the cytotoxic agent calicheamicin inside the cell. Calicheamicin causes double-stranded DNA breaks, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (programmed cell death) of the leukemia cells.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely used alternate names exist for the generic drug Inotuzumab ozogamicin.
- **Brand Name:** Besponsa™

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Inotuzumab ozogamicin exerts its anti-leukemic effect by binding specifically to CD22, a cell surface antigen expressed on B-lymphoblasts.  Upon internalization, the cytotoxic payload calicheamicin is released, inducing DNA damage and subsequently leading to cell death. The drug is cell cycle-independent, meaning it can kill cancer cells regardless of their stage in the cell cycle.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  The antibody component distributes mainly in the blood, while the small molecule component, calicheamicin, has a larger volume of distribution, indicating tissue penetration.  Inotuzumab ozogamicin is primarily metabolized through non-enzymatic reduction, with calicheamicin being the main compound undergoing metabolism. Elimination occurs through multiple pathways, and the terminal half-life of the drug is around 12.3 days.  The pharmacokinetics of inotuzumab ozogamicin are not significantly affected by age, race, sex, or mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment.
- **Mode of Action:** The antibody portion targets the CD22 receptor. The calicheamicin payload is linked to the antibody through a chemical linker. Upon cellular internalization, the linker is cleaved, releasing the cytotoxic agent calicheamicin within the cell.  Calicheamicin then binds to DNA, creating double-strand breaks which disrupt cellular replication and ultimately cause cell death.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Inotuzumab ozogamicin is primarily metabolized through non-enzymatic reduction of calicheamicin. The elimination pathways are not fully characterized but are thought to include hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Cycle 1:** Total dose of 1.8 mg/m² per 21-day cycle, divided into three doses.
    - Day 1: 0.8 mg/m² IV infusion over 1 hour.
    - Day 8: 0.5 mg/m² IV infusion over 1 hour.
    - Day 15: 0.5 mg/m² IV infusion over 1 hour.
- **Subsequent Cycles (for patients who achieve CR/CRi):** Total dose of 1.5 mg/m² per 28-day cycle, divided into three doses.
    - Day 1: 0.5 mg/m² IV infusion over 1 hour.
    - Day 8: 0.5 mg/m² IV infusion over 1 hour.
    - Day 15: 0.5 mg/m² IV infusion over 1 hour.
- **Subsequent Cycles (for patients who do not achieve CR/CRi):** Total dose of 1.8 mg/m² per 28-day cycle, divided into three doses.
    - Day 1: 0.8 mg/m² IV infusion over 1 hour.
    - Day 8: 0.5 mg/m² IV infusion over 1 hour.
    - Day 15: 0.5 mg/m² IV infusion over 1 hour.
- Patients who do not achieve CR or CRi within 3 cycles should discontinue treatment. For patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the recommended duration is 2 cycles.  A third cycle may be considered for those who do not achieve CR or CRi after 2 cycles.  For patients not proceeding to HSCT, a maximum of 6 cycles may be administered.


#### **Children:**

- The safety and efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin in children aged 0 to <18 years have not been established. No dosage recommendations can be made.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are recommended for elderly patients. However, they should be closely monitored for adverse effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustments are needed for mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No dose adjustments are needed for mild or moderate hepatic impairment.  However, close monitoring of liver function is recommended.  Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not receive Inotuzumab ozogamicin. 
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Patients with underlying medical conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, infections, or bleeding disorders should be closely monitored for exacerbation of their conditions.
