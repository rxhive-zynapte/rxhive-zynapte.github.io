## **Usage**

- Insulin Aspart Protamine is prescribed for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus to control hyperglycemia.
- **Pharmacological Classification**:  Rapid-acting/Intermediate-acting Insulin, Antidiabetic Agent.
- **Mechanism of Action**: Insulin Aspart Protamine is a combination of insulin aspart (rapid-acting) and insulin aspart protamine (intermediate-acting). It mimics endogenous insulin, facilitating glucose uptake by muscle and fat cells and suppressing hepatic glucose production.

## **Alternate Names**

- Insulin aspart protamine/insulin aspart
- **Brand Names**: NovoLog Mix 70/30, NovoMix 30

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**:  Lowers blood glucose by binding to insulin receptors, promoting glucose transport into cells and inhibiting hepatic glucose output.  The 30/70 mix provides both rapid and sustained glucose control.
- **Pharmacokinetics**:
    - **Absorption**: Subcutaneous absorption is faster for the insulin aspart component, providing a rapid onset of action, while the protamine-bound aspart is absorbed more slowly, giving an intermediate duration of action.
    - **Metabolism**:  Primarily metabolized in the liver and kidneys by insulin-degrading enzymes.
    - **Elimination**:  Excreted by the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action**: Binds to insulin receptors, triggering intracellular signaling cascades that lead to increased glucose uptake and utilization.
- **Receptor Binding**: Binds specifically to insulin receptors. The binding triggers tyrosine kinase activity, activating pathways responsible for glucose transport and glycogen synthesis.
- **Elimination Pathways**: Primarily renal and hepatic.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults**:
- **Type 1 Diabetes**: 0.5-1.0 units/kg/day, divided into two doses.  Adjust based on individual needs.
- **Type 2 Diabetes**:  Initial dose: 6 units twice daily or 12 units once daily. Titrate based on individual glycemic response.

#### **Children**:
- 10 years and older: Similar to adult dosing.
- 6-9 years: Limited clinical experience; use with caution.
- Under 6 years: Not recommended.

#### **Special Cases**:
- **Elderly Patients**: Initiate at lower doses and titrate cautiously due to increased risk of hypoglycemia.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Dosage adjustment is necessary. Monitor closely.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Dosage adjustment is necessary. Monitor closely.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Adjust dosage based on individual needs and metabolic status.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Insulin Aspart Protamine is typically not used in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Rapid-acting insulin or intravenous glucose solutions are preferred in these scenarios for tighter glycemic control.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are required based on patient factors like physical activity, meal patterns, renal/hepatic function, and acute illness.  Close monitoring of blood glucose is crucial.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
- Hypoglycemia
- Injection site reactions (redness, swelling, itching)
- Weight gain

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Severe hypoglycemia
- Anaphylaxis
- Hypokalemia

### **Long-Term Effects**
- Lipodystrophy

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
- Severe hypoglycemia requiring assistance
- Angioedema

## **Contraindications**
- Hypoglycemia
- Hypersensitivity to insulin aspart, protamine, or excipients.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Medications affecting glucose metabolism (e.g., oral antidiabetics, corticosteroids)
- ACE inhibitors
- Beta-blockers
- Alcohol

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category**: B
- **Fetal Risks**: Potential for fetal hypoglycemia; monitor carefully.
- **Breastfeeding**: Insulin aspart does transfer into breast milk, but poses minimal risk to the infant.  Dosage adjustments may be necessary.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action**:  Enhances glucose uptake and suppresses hepatic glucose output.
- **Side Effects**: Hypoglycemia, injection site reactions, weight gain.
- **Contraindications**: Hypoglycemia, hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions**: Medications altering glucose metabolism.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding**: Generally safe; monitor blood glucose.
- **Dosage**:  Individualized based on patient need.
- **Monitoring Parameters**: Blood glucose levels, potassium levels.


## **Popular Combinations**

Often combined with other oral antidiabetic agents or GLP-1 receptor agonists to achieve glycemic control.


## **Precautions**

- Monitor blood glucose regularly.
- Rotate injection sites to avoid lipodystrophy.
- Educate patients on recognizing and treating hypoglycemia.
- Patients with renal or hepatic impairment require careful monitoring and dosage adjustments.
- Alcohol can potentiate hypoglycemia.
