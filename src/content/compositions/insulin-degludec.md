      What is the recommended starting dose of Insulin Degludec?**

      **A:** The recommended starting dose varies depending on the type of
      diabetes and prior insulin use. For insulin-naïve patients with type 2
      diabetes, it is 10 units once daily. For type 1 diabetes or patients
      already on insulin therapy, the starting dose is generally the same as the
      total daily dose of their previous long- or intermediate-acting insulin.
      Pediatric dosing for current insulin users is typically started at 80% of
      the previous daily long-acting insulin dose.

      **A:** Insulin Degludec has a longer duration of action than Insulin
      Glargine, providing a more stable and predictable basal insulin level. 
      This may result in fewer episodes of hypoglycemia.

## **Usage**

- Insulin Degludec is prescribed for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents, and children aged 1 year and older to improve glycemic control.  It is a long-acting basal insulin analog.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Long-acting insulin analog, antidiabetic agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Insulin Degludec binds to the insulin receptor, mimicking the action of endogenous insulin. This leads to increased glucose uptake in peripheral tissues (muscle and fat) and decreased hepatic glucose production.

## **Alternate Names**

- Insulin Degludec
- **Brand Names:** Tresiba, Ryzodeg 70/30 (in combination with insulin aspart)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Insulin Degludec forms multi-hexamers at the injection site, resulting in a slow, prolonged release of insulin monomers into the circulation.  This provides a stable, basal level of insulin, reducing fluctuations in blood glucose.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Slow and prolonged absorption from the subcutaneous injection site due to the formation of multi-hexamers.
    - **Metabolism:**  Metabolized similarly to human insulin, primarily in the liver and kidneys.
    - **Elimination:**  Primarily renal elimination.
- **Mode of Action:** Binds to the insulin receptor, a tyrosine kinase receptor, triggering a cascade of intracellular signaling pathways. This leads to translocation of glucose transporters (GLUT4) to the cell membrane, facilitating glucose uptake. It also inhibits gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in the liver.
- **Receptor Binding:** Binds specifically to the insulin receptor.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Type 1 Diabetes:** Initially, one-third to one-half of the total daily insulin requirement administered subcutaneously once daily. The remainder of the daily insulin dose should be administered as a bolus (rapid-acting) insulin with meals.
- **Type 2 Diabetes (insulin naive):** 10 units subcutaneously once daily.
- **Type 2 Diabetes (current insulin users):** Start at the same dose as the total daily long- or intermediate-acting insulin.
- Titrate dose every 3–4 days based on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, aiming for a target FPG of 80–130 mg/dL. Maximum dose is determined by individual patient response.


#### **Children (1 year and older):**

- **Type 1 or 2 Diabetes (insulin naive):** Similar to adult dosing.
- **Type 2 Diabetes (current insulin users):** Initiate at 80% of the total daily long- or intermediate-acting insulin dose to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia.  Adjust dosage based on metabolic needs, blood glucose monitoring, and glycemic control goals. For pediatric patients requiring less than 5 units daily, use the U-100 vial.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Close glucose monitoring is essential. Dosage adjustments may be necessary due to age-related changes in insulin sensitivity and renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage reduction may be needed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dosage reduction may be needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Individualized dosage adjustments based on specific comorbid conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease) and their impact on glucose metabolism.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Insulin Degludec is a basal insulin analog and is not typically used in acute settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Rapid-acting insulins are preferred in such cases for tighter glucose control.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on FPG levels, changes in insulin requirements (e.g., during illness, stress, pregnancy, or with weight changes), concomitant medications, and other factors influencing glucose metabolism.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
- Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling)
- Lipodystrophy (changes in fat tissue at the injection site)
- Weight gain
- Peripheral edema (swelling in the hands and feet)


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Severe hypoglycemia (loss of consciousness, seizures)
- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
- Hypokalemia (low potassium levels)


### **Long-Term Effects**

- Potential for weight gain with prolonged use
- Possible increased risk of cardiovascular events (though this is debated)


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Anaphylaxis
- Severe hypoglycemia

## **Contraindications**

- Hypoglycemia
- Hypersensitivity to insulin degludec or any of the excipients

## **Drug Interactions**

- Other insulin products: May enhance the hypoglycemic effects.
- Hypoglycemic agents: Additive hypoglycemic effect.
- Hyperglycemic agents (e.g., corticosteroids): May reduce the hypoglycemic effect of insulin degludec.
- Beta-blockers: May mask symptoms of hypoglycemia.
- Alcohol: May increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
- Many other drug interactions exist; consult a comprehensive drug interaction resource.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Can be used during pregnancy if clinically needed.  Close monitoring of blood glucose is essential, and dosage adjustments are often required.
- **Breastfeeding:** Can be used during breastfeeding.  No significant adverse effects on the infant are expected.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Binds to insulin receptors, increasing glucose uptake and decreasing hepatic glucose production.
- **Side Effects:** Hypoglycemia, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, weight gain, edema.
- **Contraindications:** Hypoglycemia, hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:** Numerous drug interactions; consult a comprehensive resource.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Generally safe with monitoring and dosage adjustments.
- **Dosage:** Individualized based on patient factors and glucose targets.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** FPG, HbA1c, potassium levels.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Insulin degludec + insulin aspart (Ryzodeg 70/30): Combines basal and bolus insulin in one injection.
- Insulin degludec + liraglutide (Xultophy 100/3.6):  Combines basal insulin with a GLP-1 receptor agonist for improved glycemic control and weight management.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Screen for allergies, assess renal and hepatic function, monitor potassium levels, educate patients on hypoglycemia management.
- **Specific Populations:** See above sections on dosage for elderly, renal/hepatic impairment, pregnancy, and breastfeeding.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Encourage healthy diet, regular exercise, and smoking cessation.
