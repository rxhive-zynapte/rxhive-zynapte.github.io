## **Usage**

- Insulin detemir is a long-acting insulin analog prescribed for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults and children.  It helps to control blood sugar levels.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antidiabetic Agent, Long-acting Insulin Analog
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Insulin detemir binds to the insulin receptor, initiating a cascade of intracellular signaling that promotes glucose uptake by peripheral tissues (especially muscle and fat) and inhibits hepatic glucose production.  It also inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Insulin detemir
- **Brand Name:** Levemir, Levemir Flexpen, Levemir FlexTouch (discontinued in the US as of April 2024 and December 2024, respectively)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Insulin detemir lowers blood glucose by mimicking the action of endogenous insulin, increasing glucose transport into cells and suppressing hepatic glucose output.  Its prolonged action is due to strong self-association at the injection site and reversible albumin binding.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Subcutaneous absorption is slow and prolonged, resulting in a flat and predictable action profile with a duration of up to 24 hours.
    - **Metabolism:**  Degraded at the injection site and in the liver, similar to human insulin.
    - **Elimination:**  Elimination pathways are similar to human insulin.
- **Mode of Action:** Binds to the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, leading to autophosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways.  This results in translocation of glucose transporters to the cell membrane and increased glucose uptake.
- **Receptor Binding:** Binds to the insulin receptor with lower affinity than human insulin, contributing to its prolonged action.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism with some renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Type 1 Diabetes:**  One-third of the total daily insulin requirement as basal insulin, supplemented with bolus insulin (rapid-acting or short-acting) before meals.  Titrate dose according to individual needs.
- **Type 2 Diabetes:**  Starting dose of 10 units once daily (or 0.1-0.2 units/kg) in the evening or bedtime, or divided twice daily.  Titrate dose to achieve glycemic targets.

#### **Children:**

- Dosage individualized based on blood glucose levels and titrated to optimal effect. Pediatric dosing may be determined by weight or by calculating a percentage of the estimated adult dosage.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate with lower doses and titrate cautiously due to increased risk of hypoglycemia.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Close glucose monitoring and dosage adjustment required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Close glucose monitoring and dosage adjustment may be required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient factors.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Insulin detemir is not typically used in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.  Short-acting or intermediate-acting insulins are generally preferred in these scenarios for more rapid glucose control.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments should be made based on blood glucose monitoring and titrated to achieve individualized glycemic goals. Factors like renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or other patient-specific factors should be considered.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Insulin detemir is often used in combination with rapid-acting or short-acting insulins (such as insulin aspart, lispro, or glulisine) as part of a basal-bolus regimen for Type 1 diabetes.
- It can also be used in combination with oral antidiabetic medications or GLP-1 receptor agonists for Type 2 diabetes.


## **Precautions**
