      What is the recommended dosage for Inulin?**


      **A:**  The typical supplemental dosage range for adults is 5-15 grams per
      day. However, amounts up to 30-40 grams may be consumed per day when
      provided as a food additive.  Children can be dosed as tolerated.  Some
      children with constipation may take up to 10g per day.

      How should I take inulin?**


      **A:** Inulin is available as a powder, capsules, or chewable tablets.  It
      can be mixed into food or drinks or taken as a supplement.  It's also
      naturally present in foods such as wheat, bananas, and artichokes.  Always
      review concentration in the selected food.  If side effects occur,
      consider dividing inulin into smaller, more frequent doses.

## **Usage**

- Inulin is primarily used as a prebiotic fiber to promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, particularly *Bifidobacteria* and *Lactobacillus*. It's also used for constipation, high triglycerides, and as a food additive to improve taste and texture.  Some studies suggest potential benefits for diabetes and weight loss, but more research is needed. It's commonly taken in a daily range of 5-15 grams/day, typically administered orally as a supplement.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Prebiotic, Fiber Supplement.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Inulin is a non-digestible carbohydrate that reaches the colon intact, where it serves as a fermentable substrate for beneficial gut bacteria. This fermentation process produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), primarily butyrate, acetate, and propionate, which have various systemic effects. These SCFAs contribute to improved gut health by lowering pH, inhibiting the growth of pathogenic bacteria, providing energy to colonocytes, and modulating immune function.

## **Alternate Names**

- Inulin is also known as chicory root extract, or inulin-type fructans (ITFs).  Variations of ITFs based on degree of polymerization include oligofructose and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), with shorter chains.  These short chain variations are often hydrolyzed from inulin.
- Brand names vary widely, and many supplement manufacturers include inulin. Always review the concentration of inulin in the selected product.  There are no FDA-approved drug brand names.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Inulin exerts its primary effects through the production of SCFAs by gut bacteria in the large intestine.  Butyrate, in particular, is the main energy source for colonocytes and promotes a healthy colonic epithelium.  The resultant decrease in luminal pH contributes to the inhibition of pathogenic bacteria.  SCFAs may have a direct effect on gut motility.  Additional systemic effects of SCFAs on glucose and lipid metabolism remain under active investigation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** As inulin is not digested or absorbed, it reaches the colon intact, and its pharmacokinetic profile is largely irrelevant for systemic availability. The absorption of inulin is limited to the large intestine through microbial fermentation. Residual inulin, after bacterial fermentation, is eliminated from the body through fecal excretion.  Systemic availability of breakdown products from inulin or SCFAs has not been well-studied.
- **Mode of Action:** Inulin acts as a substrate for specific types of bacteria in the colon, promoting their growth. These bacteria ferment inulin, producing SCFAs as a byproduct.  SCFAs modulate immune function, provide a primary fuel source to colonocytes, and decrease the luminal pH. These processes influence downstream metabolism, leading to effects such as potentially improved cholesterol levels and blood sugar control.
- Inulin and SCFAs are not known to have any receptor binding, enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation.
- **Elimination Pathway:** Primarily eliminated through fecal excretion as indigestible fiber and SCFAs.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Inulin supplements typically range between 2-3 grams per supplement, though some are sold with higher concentration. Daily intake as a food additive varies, but 25-30 grams total fiber per day, regardless of source, is recommended.  Doses of 8-18 grams daily of supplemental inulin have been used safely for up to 24 weeks.  The maximum daily dose is 30-40g for short periods or when provided in food. Doses greater than this amount have been associated with gastrointestinal issues such as increased gas and abdominal discomfort.

#### **Children:** Inulin is likely safe for children in amounts found in foods. There is no specific dosage guidance for supplemental inulin in children.  Start with small doses and consider gradual increases based on tolerance and needs.  In cases of constipation in children, doses up to 10g/day have been studied, though many factors influence the decision to treat a child with inulin for constipation.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses (e.g., 5g/day) and titrate up slowly based on tolerance. Evaluate for potential gastrointestinal side effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustments are needed for impaired renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustments are needed for hepatic dysfunction.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific dose adjustments are established, but individual patient tolerance should guide use and titration.  Specifically consider IBD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), where inulin's fermentability may exacerbate symptoms.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

There is limited evidence to support supplemental inulin dosing in specific clinical use cases.  Dietary intake is part of an overall healthy diet.  Supplemental inulin is generally for individuals who are unable to take adequate fiber from food.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based primarily on individual gastrointestinal tolerance. If side effects occur, reduce dosage or frequency of administration.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
- Gas
- Bloating
- Abdominal discomfort
- Cramps
- Diarrhea (or constipation)
- Nausea (rare)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (rare)

### **Long-Term Effects**

None known.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

No significant ADRs have been identified.


## **Contraindications**

- Known allergy to inulin or related compounds

## **Drug Interactions**

- No clinically significant drug-drug interactions are known.
- Consider potential interactions with medications affecting gut motility.
- Theoretically, inulin may affect drug absorption due to altered gut transit time, though this is not well studied or clinically relevant.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Not established, though inulin is present in food, and is considered generally safe for pregnant women.
- **Fetal Risks/Teratogenicity:** None known.
- **Breastfeeding:** Inulin present in food is not a concern for breastfeeding.  There is no clinical data on safety of higher dose supplemental inulin in breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Fermented in the colon by bacteria, producing SCFAs that improve gut health and may have systemic effects on lipid and glucose metabolism.
- **Side Effects:** Gas, bloating, abdominal discomfort, cramps, diarrhea, and rarely nausea.
- **Contraindications:** Allergy, IBD, IBS (relative).
- **Drug Interactions:** None well established.  Possible impact on intestinal transit time.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Likely safe at doses consumed as food.  Insufficient data for supplemental doses.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 5-15g daily, or up to 30-40g when consumed in food. Children: Dose as tolerated; some children with constipation consume up to 10g.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for gastrointestinal side effects.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Inulin is sometimes combined with probiotics in synbiotic formulations to enhance gut health.

## **Precautions**
Start with a low dose and titrate gradually.
