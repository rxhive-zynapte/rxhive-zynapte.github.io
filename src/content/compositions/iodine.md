      Can iodine supplements be used to treat hyperthyroidism?**

      **A:** High doses of iodine (e.g., as potassium iodide solution - SSKI or
      Lugol's solution) may be used short-term in conjunction with other
      medications to manage hyperthyroidism, particularly before surgery or
      radioactive iodine treatment. However, iodine alone is not typically a
      long-term solution for hyperthyroidism and can worsen the condition in
      some cases.

## **Usage**

- Iodine is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of iodine deficiency and its consequences, including goiter and some thyroid disorders.  A specific type, potassium iodide, is approved to prevent thyroid damage after radioactive iodine exposure. It is also used as an antiseptic and disinfectant for wound care.
- **Pharmacological Classification**:  Trace element, antiseptic, expectorant (potassium iodide), thyroid-blocking agent (potassium iodide).
- **Mechanism of Action**: Iodine is essential for thyroid hormone synthesis.  It is actively transported into thyroid follicular cells where it is oxidized and incorporated into tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin, forming thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). Potassium iodide competitively inhibits radioactive iodine uptake, reducing radiation-induced thyroid cancer risk.  As an antiseptic, iodine exerts broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity by disrupting microbial protein synthesis and membrane integrity.


## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional variations:** Iode (French), Iod (German), Iodio (Spanish),  ヨウ素 (Japanese - Yōso)
- **Brand Names:**  Many iodine supplements are available, often combined with other minerals. Potassium iodide is available as ThyroSafe, iOSAT, and Pima.  Various antiseptic solutions containing povidone-iodine (Betadine is one example) are also marketed.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Iodine is crucial for thyroid hormone production, influencing metabolic rate, growth, and development.  Potassium iodide blocks radioactive iodine uptake by the thyroid, protecting it from radiation damage. Topically, iodine acts as a broad-spectrum antiseptic, killing bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa.
- **Pharmacokinetics**:  
    - *Absorption*: Iodine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally.  Topical absorption is minimal.
    - *Distribution*: Iodine is distributed throughout the body, concentrating primarily in the thyroid gland. It also accumulates in salivary, gastric, and mammary glands.
    - *Metabolism*:  Iodine is oxidized in the thyroid to form thyroid hormones.  Excess iodine is excreted primarily in the urine.
    - *Elimination*:  Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination for both iodine and potassium iodide.
- **Mode of Action**: In the thyroid, iodine is transported into follicular cells via the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). It is then oxidized by thyroid peroxidase and incorporated into thyroglobulin.  Coupling of iodotyrosines within thyroglobulin forms T3 and T4.   Potassium iodide saturates the NIS, reducing radioactive iodine uptake. Antiseptic action involves disruption of microbial protein synthesis and cell membrane integrity.
