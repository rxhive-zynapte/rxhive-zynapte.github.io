## **Usage**

Iohexol is a non-ionic, water-soluble, iodinated radiographic contrast medium. It is used to enhance the visibility of internal organs and structures during various X-ray and computed tomography (CT) imaging procedures.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Radiographic contrast agent.

**Mechanism of Action:**  Iohexol does not have a pharmacological effect on the body. Its mechanism of action is based on its high iodine content, which absorbs X-rays and enhances the contrast between tissues or structures being examined and the surrounding areas, enabling clearer visualization.

## **Alternate Names**

Iohexol is known internationally by the same generic name. It is frequently marketed under the brand name **OMNIPAQUE**. Other brand names might exist regionally.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Iohexol is inert and does not have any direct pharmacological effects on the body's tissues.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Following intravenous administration, iohexol is rapidly distributed in the extracellular fluid. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier in intact central nervous systems. After oral or rectal administration for GI studies, absorption is minimal.
* **Metabolism:** Iohexol is not metabolized.
* **Elimination:** It is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys via glomerular filtration, with near-complete elimination within 24 hours in patients with normal renal function. Elimination may be delayed in patients with renal impairment.

**Mode of Action:**  The iodine in iohexol absorbs X-rays, creating enhanced contrast on radiographic images. There is no receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation involved.


## **Dosage**

Iohexol dosage varies greatly depending on the specific procedure, patient age, weight, and renal function. Always refer to product-specific guidelines and consider patient factors.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Dosing depends on the procedure. Examples:

* **Intravenous Urography:** 200-350 mgI/kg body weight.
* **Angiography:** varies depending on the vessel being studied.
* **CT:**  varies depending on the organ being imaged.

#### **Children:**

Dosing is usually based on weight, typically lower than adult doses. Consult pediatric dosing guidelines for specifics based on the procedure.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start at the lower end of the dosing range due to potential age-related decreased organ function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction or alternative imaging methods may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution advised; dose adjustment may be required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider the impact of coexisting medical conditions on dosing.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosage in these settings should be individualized according to the specific protocol for the procedure.

* **Intubation:** Not applicable.
* **Surgical Procedures:** Intraoperative angiography may utilize iohexol, with dosing dependent on the procedure.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not applicable.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  Dose adjustments based on patient hemodynamics and renal function.
* **Emergency Situations:** Dose optimization is crucial, considering potential hemodynamic instability and renal compromise.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Modifications are necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and other medical conditions. Always individualize the dose based on patient characteristics and consult product-specific guidelines.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Pain at injection site
* Warmth or flushing sensation
* Altered taste (metallic)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Renal failure
* Seizures
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Thyroid storm (in patients with hyperthyroidism)


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Generally, iohexol doesn't cause long-term side effects, as it is excreted quickly. However, rare cases of delayed reactions like nephropathy have been reported.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe ADRs like anaphylaxis, renal failure, and cardiac events require immediate medical intervention.


## **Contraindications**

* Known hypersensitivity to iohexol or its components.
* Severe thyrotoxicosis.
* Manifest or latent decompensated cardiac failure.
* Severe renal insufficiency.
* Myelography in active infections or bleeding disorders.
* Concurrent intrathecal corticosteroid administration.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Metformin:** Increased risk of lactic acidosis. Discontinue metformin pre-procedure and re-evaluate renal function before restarting.
* **Radioactive Iodine:** May interfere with thyroid uptake and decrease efficacy of radioactive iodine therapy.
* **Interleukin-2:** Increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions.
* **Other nephrotoxic drugs:** May increase risk of renal impairment.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Iohexol crosses the placenta. Use only if clearly needed. Hysterosalpingography is contraindicated in pregnancy.
* **Breastfeeding:** Small amounts are excreted in breast milk.  Breastfeeding may be continued, though some recommend temporary interruption.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Provides radiographic contrast by absorbing X-rays.
* **Side Effects:**  Headache, nausea, vomiting, pain at injection site, allergic reactions (rarely severe).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, thyrotoxicosis, decompensated cardiac failure, severe renal insufficiency.
* **Drug Interactions:** Metformin, radioactive iodine.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution in pregnancy; breastfeeding generally considered safe.
* **Dosage:** Varies widely depending on procedure and patient factors.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, vital signs, allergic reactions.


## **Popular Combinations**

Iohexol is typically used alone but might be combined with other agents during specific procedures (e.g., saline flush).

## **Precautions**

* Evaluate renal function, especially in high-risk patients.
* Ensure adequate hydration.
* Have emergency equipment and personnel available for managing potential reactions.
* Exercise caution in patients with a history of allergies or asthma.
