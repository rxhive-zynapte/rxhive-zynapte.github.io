## **Usage**

Iopamidol is a non-ionic, water-soluble, iodinated radiographic contrast medium. It is used to enhance the visibility of internal organs and structures during radiographic procedures like X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, and angiography. 

It is indicated for:

* **Intra-arterial procedures:** Peripheral arteriography, visceral arteriography, aortography, and coronary arteriography (including left ventriculography).
* **Intravenous procedures:** Excretory urography, intravenous digital subtraction angiography, contrast enhancement for computed tomography (head and body), and peripheral venography (phlebography).
* **Intrathecal procedures:** Lumbar, thoracic, and cervical myelography (using a specific formulation).

**Pharmacological Classification:** Radiographic contrast agent.

**Mechanism of Action:** Iopamidol works by absorbing X-rays to a greater degree than surrounding tissues. This creates a contrast that allows visualization of blood vessels, organs, and other structures.


## **Alternate Names**

Iopamidol is the generic name. Brand names include Isovue®, Isovue-M®, and others. International or regional variations of the name may exist.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Iopamidol exerts its effect solely through its ability to absorb X-rays, enhancing radiographic contrast. It has no direct pharmacological activity on the body.

**Pharmacokinetics:** 

* **Absorption:** After intravascular administration, iopamidol distributes rapidly into the extracellular fluid. It does not bind to plasma proteins. For intrathecal use, the distribution is within the cerebrospinal fluid.
* **Metabolism:** Iopamidol is not metabolized.
* **Elimination:** It is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys via glomerular filtration. A small portion may be excreted hepatically in patients with renal impairment.

**Mode of Action:** Iopamidol's mode of action relies on its high iodine content. Iodine atoms within the iopamidol molecule effectively absorb X-ray photons, resulting in increased radiopacity of the contrast-filled structure compared to surrounding tissues. There is no receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation involved.

**Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion. Hepatic excretion may play a minor role, particularly in individuals with compromised renal function.


## **Dosage**

Iopamidol dosage is dependent on the specific procedure, patient age, weight, and renal function.  Always refer to the specific product labeling.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Dosage varies greatly depending on the procedure. Doses for intravenous procedures typically range from 50-200 mL of solutions containing 250-370 mg iodine/mL.  Intra-arterial doses are typically lower.  For intrathecal use, a 200 mg iodine/mL formulation is used, with doses typically between 10-15 mL.


#### **Children:**  Pediatric doses are generally based on weight (mL/kg) using concentrations similar to adults.  Refer to product-specific pediatric dosing charts.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients**:  Exercise caution due to potential age-related decline in renal function.  Lower doses and careful monitoring are advised.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Dose adjustments are required, and the benefit-risk ratio should be carefully evaluated.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Close monitoring is required as hepatic excretion may become more significant.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Assess the potential risks in patients with conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and thyroid disorders.


### **Clinical Use Cases**
Dosage recommendations are highly variable and specific to the clinical setting and procedure. Always consult the product information for precise guidance.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are necessary for renal/hepatic impairment, and individualization is essential. Consider factors like creatinine clearance, liver function tests, and co-existing medical conditions.


## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, warmth or flushing, headache, pain at the injection site, metallic taste.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), renal failure, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, stroke.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Generally, there are no long-term side effects associated with a single administration of Iopamidol. However, repeated exposure to high doses of iodine can affect thyroid function.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, nephrotoxicity, thyroid dysfunction, neurotoxicity, cardiovascular events.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to iopamidol, severe combined hepatic and renal impairment, intrathecal use with corticosteroids, active thyroid storm.



## **Drug Interactions**

Interferes with thyroid function tests for up to 16 days.  May increase risk of renal toxicity with metformin. Caution is advised in patients receiving interleukin-2.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy**:  Pregnancy Category B. Use only if clearly needed, weighing the potential benefits against the risks.
* **Breastfeeding**:  Iodinated contrast agents are excreted in breast milk. A lactating woman may choose to pump and discard breast milk for up to 10 hours after administration.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** X-ray absorption enhancing radiographic contrast.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, warmth, metallic taste (common); allergic reactions, renal failure, seizures (serious).
* **Contraindications**: Hypersensitivity, severe combined hepatic/renal impairment.
* **Drug Interactions**: Interferes with thyroid function tests, potential renal toxicity with metformin.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding**: Use with caution; consult product labeling.
* **Dosage:** Highly variable; consult product labeling for specific procedures and patient factors.
* **Monitoring Parameters**: Renal function, thyroid function (especially in infants and young children), vital signs.


## **Popular Combinations**


Iopamidol is typically used alone but can be used in conjunction with other imaging agents or medications related to the specific procedure.


## **Precautions**



* **General Precautions**: Screen for allergies, assess renal and hepatic function, thyroid status, and comorbid conditions. Maintain adequate hydration before and after administration. Always have emergency resuscitation equipment available.

* **Specific Populations**:  Consult product labeling for specific precautions in pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, children, and the elderly.
