## **Usage**

Ipilimumab is prescribed for the treatment of various cancers, including:

* **Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma:** In adults and children 12 years and older.
* **Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma:**  In patients with cutaneous melanoma with pathologic involvement of regional lymph nodes (greater than 1 mm) who have undergone complete resection, including total lymphadenectomy.
* **Renal Cell Carcinoma:** In combination with nivolumab for intermediate or poor risk, previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma.
* **Microsatellite Instability-High (MSI-H) or Mismatch Repair Deficient (dMMR) Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (CRC):** In combination with nivolumab for adults whose disease progressed following treatment with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan.
* **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC):** In combination with nivolumab for first-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC in adults whose tumors express PD-L1 (â‰¥1%) with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations.
* **Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma:** In combination with nivolumab.
* **Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma:** In combination with nivolumab.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Ipilimumab is classified as an immune checkpoint inhibitor, specifically a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) blocking antibody.

**Mechanism of Action:** Ipilimumab blocks the inhibitory effects of CTLA-4, a protein receptor that downregulates the immune system's T-cell response. By inhibiting CTLA-4, ipilimumab enhances T-cell activation and proliferation, leading to an increased anti-tumor immune response.


## **Alternate Names**

**Generic Name:** Ipilimumab

**Brand Name:** YERVOY


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ipilimumab enhances the immune system's attack on cancer cells by blocking the inhibitory signal of CTLA-4 on T-cells. This leads to increased T-cell activation, proliferation, and infiltration into tumors, resulting in tumor regression.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Administered intravenously, achieving rapid distribution.
* **Metabolism:** As a monoclonal antibody, it's not primarily metabolized by CYP enzymes but undergoes catabolism like endogenous IgG.
* **Elimination:** Primarily through protein catabolism, with negligible renal or hepatic excretion.


**Mode of Action:** Ipilimumab binds to CTLA-4, preventing its interaction with its ligands (B7-1/B7-2).  This blockade removes the inhibitory signal on T cells, promoting their activation and proliferation, thus increasing the anti-tumor immune response.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Ipilimumab binds to the CTLA-4 receptor, inhibiting its function. It does not involve direct enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily through protein catabolism.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Melanoma (Monotherapy):** 3 mg/kg intravenously over 90 minutes every 3 weeks for a total of 4 doses.  All doses must be administered within 16 weeks of the first dose.
* **Melanoma (Adjuvant):** 10 mg/kg intravenously over 90 minutes every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by 10 mg/kg every 12 weeks for up to 3 years or until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity.
* **Renal Cell Carcinoma (with Nivolumab):** 1 mg/kg intravenously over 30 minutes immediately following nivolumab on the same day, repeated every 3 weeks for up to 4 doses.
* **MSI-H/dMMR Metastatic CRC (with Nivolumab):** 1 mg/kg intravenously over 30 minutes immediately following nivolumab on the same day, repeated every 3 weeks for up to 4 doses.
* **NSCLC (with Nivolumab):** 1 mg/kg intravenously every 6 weeks in combination with nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks. Continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 2 years.
* **Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (with Nivolumab):** 1 mg/kg intravenously every 6 weeks in combination with nivolumab 360 mg every 3 weeks, for up to 24 months.
* **Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (with Nivolumab):** 1 mg/kg intravenously every 6 weeks in combination with nivolumab (either 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 360 mg every 3 weeks). Treatment is recommended until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months.


#### **Children:**

* **Melanoma (Monotherapy, age 12 and older):** 3 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for a maximum of 4 doses.
* **Melanoma (with Nivolumab, age 12 and older):** 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks with nivolumab 1 mg/kg, for a maximum of 4 doses.
* **MSI-H/dMMR mCRC (with Nivolumab, age 12 and older):** 1 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks plus nivolumab (dosing according to nivolumab guidelines).


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment required.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution in severe renal impairment; no data available for dose adjustment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution; limited data available.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized assessment and management of immune-related adverse events is crucial.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Ipilimumab's clinical use focuses on cancer treatment, and it is not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments or interruptions are primarily based on the severity of immune-related adverse events. For specific guidance on dosage adjustments for various adverse reactions, refer to the product monograph.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Fatigue, diarrhea, rash, pruritus, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, fever, headache, and injection site reactions.
