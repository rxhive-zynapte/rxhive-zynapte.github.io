## **Usage**

- Irinotecan is prescribed for metastatic colorectal cancer, often in combination with other chemotherapy agents like 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin.  It is also used in combination regimens for various other cancers like small cell lung cancer,  gastric cancer, and pancreatic cancer.
- **Pharmacological classification:**  Irinotecan is a topoisomerase I inhibitor.  It belongs to the antineoplastic agent class, specifically categorized under the miscellaneous antineoplastics.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Irinotecan and its active metabolite, SN-38, bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex, stabilizing it and thus inhibiting the religation of single-strand DNA breaks created by topoisomerase I during DNA replication. This leads to DNA damage and ultimately apoptosis (cell death) of cancer cells.



## **Alternate Names**

- International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Irinotecan hydrochloride trihydrate
- **Brand Names:** Camptosar®, Campto®


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Irinotecan exerts its cytotoxic effect by inhibiting topoisomerase I, leading to DNA damage and apoptosis in rapidly dividing cells, primarily targeting cancerous cells.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Administered intravenously.
    - **Metabolism:**  Irinotecan is a prodrug converted in the liver by carboxylesterase enzymes to its active metabolite, SN-38, which is substantially more potent than irinotecan itself. SN-38 is further metabolized by UGT1A1 enzyme primarily to the inactive metabolite, SN-38 glucuronide (SN-38G). Polymorphisms in UGT1A1 (specifically *28 allele) affect glucuronidation and increase the risk of severe side effects, such as neutropenia and diarrhea.
    - **Elimination:**  Irinotecan and its metabolites are eliminated through biliary excretion into the feces, with approximately 25% excreted in urine.


- **Mode of Action:** Irinotecan and SN-38 create a ternary complex with topoisomerase I and DNA, preventing the enzyme from religating single-strand DNA breaks. This leads to double-strand DNA breaks during DNA replication, initiating cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Irinotecan acts through inhibition of the enzyme topoisomerase I. SN-38 is also associated with anticholinesterase activity.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily through the hepatobiliary route, mainly fecal excretion, with a small amount excreted in the urine.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- Weekly Schedule:
    - 125 mg/m² IV infusion over 90 minutes once weekly for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week rest period.
    - Dose may be adjusted based on individual tolerance.
    - Maximum: 150 mg/m²
- Every-3-Weeks Schedule: 350 mg/m² IV infusion over 30-90 minutes every 3 weeks.
- Every-2-weeks Dosage Schedule: 250 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion.
- Several combination regimens for irinotecan exist, each requiring specific dosing and administration strategies.  These should be referenced based on the exact clinical need.

#### **Children:**  Safety and efficacy not fully established. Limited data available regarding usage and dosage in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Close monitoring is recommended due to potential increased sensitivity to toxicities, especially diarrhea. For patients ≥ 70 years,  weekly dosing at 100mg/m<sup>2</sup> or q3w dosing at 300mg/m<sup>2</sup> should be considered as starting doses.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No formal studies, but renal dose adjustment is not typically required as the kidney is not a major route of excretion.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Reduce the starting dose based on bilirubin levels:
    - Bilirubin 1 to 1.5 x ULN: 350 mg/m² (monotherapy) or specific regimen guidelines.
    - Bilirubin 1.5 to 3 x ULN: 200 mg/m² (monotherapy) or specific regimen guidelines.
    - Bilirubin > 3 x ULN:  Contraindicated.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Exercise caution and consider dose adjustments, especially in individuals with prior pelvic or abdominal radiation therapy, Gilbert's syndrome, UGT1A1 polymorphisms, or other conditions affecting drug metabolism and clearance.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  
Irinotecan is not typically indicated for use in situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or acute emergency situations. Its primary role is in chemotherapy regimens for specific cancer types, particularly metastatic colorectal cancer.

### **Dosage Adjustments**  
Dose adjustments are generally based on the individual patient's tolerance and adverse reactions. Dose reductions are usually made in increments of 25 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for weekly regimens or 50 to 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for other administration schedules. Closely monitor complete blood counts, liver function tests, and other relevant clinical parameters.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**
- Diarrhea (can be severe and life-threatening), nausea, vomiting, neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, alopecia, abdominal pain, anorexia. Early-onset diarrhea may manifest as a cholinergic syndrome and should be treated with atropine.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Severe neutropenia (increased risk of infections), febrile neutropenia, severe diarrhea with dehydration and electrolyte disturbances, interstitial lung disease, anaphylaxis.


### **Long-Term Effects**
- Secondary malignancies, chronic gastrointestinal problems, persistent fatigue, cardiac toxicity.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
- Severe myelosuppression (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia), acute cholinergic syndrome (early-onset diarrhea, sweating, abdominal cramps, rhinorrhea, lacrimation), severe delayed-onset diarrhea, interstitial pneumonitis, hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylaxis.



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to irinotecan or any component of the formulation.
- Severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin >3 x ULN).
- History of severe allergic reactions to topoisomerase I inhibitors.
- Chronic inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis).
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding (unless benefits outweigh risks), bowel obstruction. Concurrent use with St. John's Wort is contraindicated.


## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP450 interactions:** Irinotecan is primarily metabolized by carboxylesterases, but its active metabolite SN-38 is subject to glucuronidation via UGT1A1. Concurrent use of inhibitors of UGT1A1 can lead to increased toxicity.
- **Other clinically significant interactions:**
    - Ketoconazole, itraconazole and other azole antifungals may enhance toxicity by increasing exposure to SN-38.
    - St. John’s Wort decreases efficacy through induction of CYP3A4.
    - Anticholinergic drugs may exacerbate constipation. 
    - Drugs causing QT prolongation increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. 
    - Immunosuppressants enhance myelosuppression. 
    - Live attenuated vaccines (e.g. yellow fever) increased risk of severe infection.
    - Dexamethasone increase risk of hyperglycemia and lymphocytopenia.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  D (Camptosar®)
- Irinotecan can cause fetal harm. Adequate contraception should be used during and for at least 6 months after treatment in women and 3 months after treatment in men.
- Breastfeeding is contraindicated. Irinotecan and SN-38 are excreted in breast milk and pose a risk to the infant.
