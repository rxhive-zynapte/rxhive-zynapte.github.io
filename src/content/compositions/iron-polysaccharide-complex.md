## **Usage**

Iron polysaccharide complex is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia.  It is classified as a hematinic and mineral supplement. It works by providing a source of iron that the body can readily absorb and utilize to synthesize hemoglobin, the protein responsible for oxygen transport in red blood cells.

## **Alternate Names**

Iron polysaccharide complex is also known as ferric hydroxide polymaltose complex. Brand names include Niferex-150, Ferrex-150, FeraMAX, and others.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Iron is an essential component of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.  Iron polysaccharide complex replenishes depleted iron stores, enabling the production of healthy red blood cells and improving oxygen-carrying capacity.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Iron from the polysaccharide complex is absorbed in the duodenum and jejunum through active transport mechanisms. The complex's structure facilitates absorption and minimizes gastrointestinal irritation.
* **Metabolism:** Absorbed iron is transported in the blood bound to transferrin and is either utilized for hemoglobin synthesis in the bone marrow or stored as ferritin and hemosiderin in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow.
* **Elimination:** Iron is primarily lost through blood loss (e.g., menstruation, gastrointestinal bleeding), shedding of epithelial cells, and excretion in bile and urine. Very small amounts are eliminated in the feces. The polysaccharide component is largely unabsorbed and excreted in the feces.

**Mode of Action:** The iron polysaccharide complex is a non-ionic form of iron where the iron is bound to a large carbohydrate molecule. This complex structure prevents the release of free iron ions, which can cause oxidative stress and gastrointestinal side effects.  Absorption occurs through a controlled process involving mucosal cells in the small intestine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* For iron deficiency: 150-300 mg of elemental iron daily, or as directed by a physician. This can be given as one to two capsules or tablets.  Higher doses might be divided and taken multiple times per day.
* For iron deficiency anemia: Dosage is based on severity and may be higher.

#### **Children:**

* Dosage is based on the child's age, weight, and iron status.  Generally, 1-6 mg/kg/day of elemental iron in divided doses, not exceeding 200 mg/day.  Specific dosing instructions vary with age.
* Liquid formulations are available for young children.
* Care should be taken to ensure accurate dosing and avoid accidental overdose in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment may be required depending on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised.  Dosage adjustments are based on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Generally, no dose adjustment is necessary, but caution is recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider potential drug interactions and disease-specific adjustments (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease).

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Iron polysaccharide complex is not typically indicated for acute or emergency medical settings listed such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergencies like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.  Intravenous iron formulations may be more suitable in such situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be needed in cases of severe iron deficiency anemia, impaired renal function, or specific patient characteristics affecting iron absorption or metabolism.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Constipation
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Upset stomach
* Dark stools (harmless)
* Temporary staining of teeth (with liquid formulations)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (hives, difficulty breathing, swelling)
* Severe stomach pain or cramps
* Bloody or tarry stools

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term use at appropriate dosages is generally safe. However, monitoring of iron levels is important to prevent iron overload.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Serious ADRs are rare but can include severe allergic reactions and gastrointestinal bleeding.

## **Contraindications**

* Hemochromatosis
* Hemosiderosis
* Hemolytic anemia
* Hypersensitivity to iron polysaccharide complex or any of its components

## **Drug Interactions**

Iron polysaccharide complex can interact with various medications, including:

* Antacids
* Tetracycline antibiotics
* Quinolone antibiotics
* Levodopa
* Levothyroxine
* Bisphosphonates
* Certain proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)

It's crucial to separate the administration of iron supplements from these drugs by at least two hours.

Food interactions:  Dairy products, tea, coffee, and high-fiber foods can decrease iron absorption. Alcohol can interfere with iron metabolism.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Iron polysaccharide complex is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  It is often recommended to treat or prevent iron deficiency anemia during these periods. Consult a physician for appropriate dosing.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Replenishes iron stores, essential for hemoglobin synthesis.
* **Side Effects:** Constipation, diarrhea, nausea, dark stools.
* **Contraindications:** Hemochromatosis, hemosiderosis, hemolytic anemia.
* **Drug Interactions:** Antacids, antibiotics (tetracyclines, quinolones), levodopa, levothyroxine.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe, consult a physician for dosing.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 150-300 mg elemental iron daily; Children: 1-6 mg/kg/day.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Hemoglobin, hematocrit, ferritin, and iron saturation levels.

## **Popular Combinations**

Iron polysaccharide complex is sometimes combined with other nutrients like folic acid, especially during pregnancy.

## **Precautions**

* Assess iron status before initiating therapy.
* Evaluate for underlying causes of anemia.
* Avoid concurrent administration of interacting drugs.
* Monitor for side effects and adjust dosage if needed.
* Counsel patients about dietary factors influencing iron absorption.
