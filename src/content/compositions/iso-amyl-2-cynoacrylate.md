## **Usage**

- Iso Amyl 2-Cyanoacrylate is a tissue adhesive indicated for topical application to close skin incisions and lacerations. It is specifically designed for surgical procedures as an alternative to sutures or staples.  It also finds application in wound closure and promoting healing post-surgical procedures, and is used in dentistry, especially after third molar extractions.
- **Pharmacological Classification**:  Tissue Adhesive, topical hemostatic agent.

## **Alternate Names**

- Isopentyl 2-cyanoacrylate
- **Brand Names**: Amcrylate

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**:  Iso Amyl 2-Cyanoacrylate polymerizes rapidly upon contact with moisture on the skin surface, forming a strong, flexible bond that holds the wound edges together. This adhesive acts as a barrier against infection and promotes wound healing. It exhibits bacteriostatic properties, inhibiting the growth of common skin pathogens.
- **Pharmacokinetics**:
    - **Absorption**: Minimal systemic absorption occurs due to the rapid polymerization and localized action.
    - **Metabolism**:  The polymerized film degrades slowly by hydrolysis.
    - **Elimination**:  Degradation products are likely eliminated through normal metabolic pathways.  
- **Mode of Action**: Polymerization reaction initiated by surface moisture creates a durable adhesive bond.  No specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation is involved.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Apply a thin layer of Iso Amyl 2-Cyanoacrylate directly to the approximated wound edges.  The amount needed depends on the wound length.

#### **Children:**

- Use with caution in pediatric patients.  Dosage should be determined by a physician based on the child's age, weight, and specific medical condition. Pediatric safety data might be limited.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: No specific dosage adjustments are necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: No specific dosage adjustments are generally needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**:  Evaluate on a case-by-case basis.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Surgical Procedures**: For closure of skin incisions and lacerations.
- Other: After tooth extraction (especially third molar).

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- No specific dosage adjustments routinely required based on organ dysfunction or metabolic disorders.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Mild skin irritation or redness at the application site.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling).

### **Long-Term Effects**

- No significant long-term adverse effects are known.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Contact dermatitis.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to cyanoacrylates.
- Deep, puncture wounds or contaminated wounds.
- Mucosal surfaces or areas near the eyes.

## **Drug Interactions**

- No clinically significant drug interactions are known.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Limited information available on use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Use cautiously if benefits outweigh potential risks. Consult with a healthcare provider before using this medicine if you are pregnant, planning to get pregnant, or breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action**: Rapid polymerization upon contact with moisture, forming an adhesive bond and sealing the wound.
- **Side Effects**: Mild skin irritation, allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications**: Hypersensitivity, deep/puncture wounds, mucosal tissues.
- **Drug Interactions**:  None known.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding**:  Limited information; use with caution if benefits outweigh potential risks.
- **Dosage**:  Apply a thin layer to approximated wound edges.
- **Monitoring Parameters**: Wound healing progress, signs of infection or allergic reaction.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Not typically used in combination with other drugs for wound closure.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Clean and dry the wound thoroughly before application. Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes.
- **Specific Populations**: Evaluate risks vs. benefits in pregnant or breastfeeding women. Use with caution in children.
