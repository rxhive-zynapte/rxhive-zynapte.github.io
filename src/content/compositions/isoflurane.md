## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Isoflurane is a general inhalation anesthetic indicated for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia.  It is used in various surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** General inhalation anesthetic, halogenated ether.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Isoflurane enhances inhibitory synaptic transmission through GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and glycine receptors. It also inhibits excitatory synaptic transmission, possibly by NMDA receptors.  The precise mechanism of action, as with other general anesthetics, remains incompletely understood.

## **Alternate Names**

- 1-Chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether (chemical name)
- **Brand Names:** Forane, Terrell, Aerrane, IsoFlo, Isoflurano, and others.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Isoflurane produces dose-dependent hypnosis, amnesia, and muscle relaxation. It also has analgesic and mild cardiovascular depressant effects, leading to hypotension and decreased systemic vascular resistance. Respiratory depression occurs with increasing doses.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Rapidly absorbed via the lungs.
    - **Metabolism:** Minimal hepatic metabolism (less than 0.2%).
    - **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated unchanged through the lungs. A small fraction is metabolized in the liver and excreted renally as inorganic fluoride.
- **Mode of Action:** Isoflurane's primary site of action is believed to be the central nervous system (CNS).  It likely modulates the activity of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, glycine receptors, and NMDA receptors.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Isoflurane potentiates the effects of GABA at GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and enhances the effects of glycine, contributing to the anesthetic effect.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly pulmonary excretion; minimal renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Induction:** 1.5% to 3% inspired concentration with or without nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O). Surgical anesthesia is typically achieved within 7-10 minutes.
- **Maintenance:** 1% to 2.5% inspired concentration with N<sub>2</sub>O.  0.5% to 1% additional isoflurane may be required when administered with oxygen alone.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for inhalation induction in infants and children due to the risk of laryngospasm, breath-holding, and increased secretions.
- Maintenance dosage should be individualized.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Lower concentrations are generally required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment not typically necessary due to minimal renal excretion.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment may be necessary, although metabolism is minimal.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful titration based on individual patient response and underlying conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation:**  Facilitates endotracheal intubation after anesthetic induction.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Used for various surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:**  Provides anesthesia during mechanical ventilation.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Rarely utilized due to its slower recovery profile compared to other anesthetic agents.
- **Emergency Situations:**  Can be used in select emergency situations but requires careful monitoring.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- Dose adjustments may be required based on patient response, co-administered medications, and presence of renal or hepatic dysfunction.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Hypotension
- Respiratory depression
- Nausea and vomiting
- Shivering
- Bradycardia or tachycardia

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Malignant hyperthermia
- Hepatic dysfunction (rarely, hepatic necrosis)
- Cardiac arrhythmias (including torsades de pointes)
- Allergic reactions

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Potential for slight decrease in intellectual function for a few days post-anesthesia.
- Small changes in mood may persist for up to 6 days post-anesthesia.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Malignant hyperthermia: A life-threatening condition characterized by muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, and metabolic acidosis.  Requires immediate intervention.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to isoflurane or other halogenated anesthetic agents.
- Known or suspected genetic susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia.

## **Drug Interactions**

- **Muscle Relaxants:** Isoflurane potentiates the effects of neuromuscular blocking agents.
- **N<sub>2</sub>O:**  Reduces the MAC of isoflurane.
- **Other CNS Depressants:**  Additive effects with other CNS depressants (e.g., opioids, benzodiazepines).
- **CYP450 Interactions:** Isoflurane has minimal interaction with CYP450 enzymes.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  C (US FDA – previous categorization). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies have shown some evidence of fetotoxicity. Use during pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the risk.  
- **Breastfeeding:** Caution advised.  Limited data suggest that isoflurane is excreted in breast milk in small amounts. Due to its short half-life, it's not expected to pose a significant risk to the infant.  Breastfeeding can typically be resumed as soon as the mother recovers sufficiently from general anesthesia.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Enhances inhibitory neurotransmission (GABA, glycine) and inhibits excitatory neurotransmission (NMDA).
- **Side Effects:** Hypotension, respiratory depression, nausea, shivering, arrhythmias.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, malignant hyperthermia susceptibility.
- **Drug Interactions:** Muscle relaxants, N<sub>2</sub>O, CNS depressants.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution.  FDA pregnancy category C (previous categorization)
- **Dosage:** Induction: 1.5%–3%; Maintenance: 1%–2.5%
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>.


## **Popular Combinations**

- N<sub>2</sub>O: Often co-administered to reduce the MAC of isoflurane and provide additional analgesia.
- Muscle relaxants: Used for enhanced muscle relaxation during surgery.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Careful patient selection and monitoring are crucial.
- **Specific Populations:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular or respiratory disease.
- **Children & Elderly:**  Dose adjustments based on age and physiologic status.
