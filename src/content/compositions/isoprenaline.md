## **Usage**

- Isoprenaline is prescribed for bradycardia (slow heart rate), heart block, and Adams-Stokes attacks. It may also be used in some cases of cardiac arrest, bronchospasm during anesthesia, and as an adjunct treatment for shock (hypovolemic, septic, cardiogenic) and low cardiac output states. Off-label uses include Brugada syndrome and provocation of syncope during tilt table testing.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  β-adrenergic agonist, sympathomimetic, inotropic agent, chronotropic agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Isoprenaline primarily stimulates β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors. This leads to increased heart rate (chronotropic effect), increased force of heart contractions (inotropic effect), and relaxation of smooth muscle in the bronchi and blood vessels (vasodilation).

## **Alternate Names**

- Isoproterenol (International Nonproprietary Name)
- **Brand Names:** Isuprel, Monico

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Isoprenaline increases heart rate, myocardial contractility, and cardiac output. It also relaxes bronchial smooth muscle, leading to bronchodilation. Peripheral vasodilation may decrease diastolic blood pressure while systolic blood pressure may remain steady or increase slightly.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Isoprenaline is rapidly absorbed after parenteral administration or inhalation. It is metabolized primarily in the liver by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and to a lesser extent by monoamine oxidase (MAO).  The major metabolite is 3-O-methylisoprenaline, which has weak beta-blocking activity. Metabolites are excreted renally. The half-life is short, ranging from minutes after intravenous administration to up to 2 hours after subcutaneous administration.
- **Mode of Action:** Isoprenaline binds to β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors, which are G protein-coupled receptors. This binding activates adenylate cyclase, increasing intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA), which then phosphorylates various intracellular proteins. In cardiac muscle, this results in increased calcium influx and enhanced contractility. In smooth muscle, PKA phosphorylates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), inactivating it and leading to relaxation.
- **Receptor Binding:**  β1 and β2 adrenergic receptor agonist.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of metabolites. Hepatic metabolism via COMT and CYP450 enzymes.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Bradycardia and Heart Block: IV infusion 2–10 mcg/min, titrated to effect.  Bolus injections can also be used.
- Shock: IV infusion 0.5–5 mcg/min, titrated to effect. Higher doses (up to 30 mcg/min or more) might be necessary in advanced shock.
- Bronchospasm during Anesthesia: IV bolus 10–20 mcg, repeated as needed.

#### **Children:**

- Pediatric dosing is not well-established.  An initial IV infusion rate of 0.1 mcg/kg/min is recommended, titrated to effect, with a usual range of 0.1-1 mcg/kg/min. Safety and efficacy in children have not been fully established.
- Neonates: 0.05–1 mcg/kg/minute, titrated to effect. Consult with a clinical toxicologist for dosing in beta-blocker overdose.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage should be carefully titrated, starting at the lower end of the range, due to potential for increased sensitivity.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment is generally not required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advised, and dosage adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with diabetes, hyperthyroidism, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and ischemic heart disease.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Monitor heart rate, blood pressure, ECG, urine output, and other relevant parameters for dose titration and adjustment. 
- Adjust dose based on patient response and comorbid conditions.


## **Side Effects**

## **Drug Interactions**

- Adrenaline: Avoid concomitant use due to additive cardiac stimulant effects.
- Digitalis: Use with caution due to increased risk of arrhythmias.
- Halogenated Anesthetics (e.g., halothane):  Use with caution due to increased risk of myocardial sensitization.
- Chlorpromazine, Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): Avoid concomitant use as these can potentiate the effects of isoprenaline.

- Beta-blockers: May reduce the effects of isoprenaline.
- COMT Inhibitors (e.g., entacapone):  May increase isoprenaline levels and toxicity.
