## **Usage**

- Isopropamide is prescribed as adjunctive therapy for peptic ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and other gastrointestinal disorders.  It can also help manage conditions causing nausea and vomiting due to its antiemetic properties when used in combination with Trifluoperazine.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Anticholinergic, antimuscarinic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Isopropamide competitively antagonizes the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. This leads to decreased gastrointestinal motility and reduced gastric acid secretion.

## **Alternate Names**

- Isopropamide iodide (chemical name)
- **Brand Names:**  Darbid (discontinued), Stelbid (discontinued) and is now commonly combined with Trifluoperazine (Stelazine) and commonly marketed under names such as GASTABID or GASTABID-2 by Torrent LABS (P) LTD.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Isopropamide decreases the motility of the gastrointestinal tract and diminishes gastric acid secretion. The anticholinergic effects can also lead to dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, and constipation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Isopropamide is administered orally. The onset of action is typically within 1-2 hours, with a duration of action between 6-8 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Competitively blocks acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors in the GI tract.
- **Receptor Binding:** Muscarinic receptor antagonist.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 5 mg two to three times daily.
- Maximum dose: 40 mg/day.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for children under 12 years old, unless specifically prescribed.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose reduction may be necessary.
