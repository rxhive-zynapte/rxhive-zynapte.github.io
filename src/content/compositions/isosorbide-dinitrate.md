## **Usage**

- Isosorbide dinitrate is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of angina pectoris (chest pain) due to coronary artery disease. It is also used as adjunctive therapy in heart failure, particularly in self-identified Black patients.  It is important to note that it is not the drug of choice for aborting an acute anginal episode due to a slower onset of action than sublingual nitroglycerin.
- **Pharmacological classification**:  Vasodilator, Antianginal agent, Nitrate
- **Mechanism of Action**: Isosorbide dinitrate is a nitrate that converts to nitric oxide in the body. Nitric oxide is a potent vasodilator, relaxing and widening blood vessels.  This reduces venous return to the heart, decreasing preload and myocardial oxygen demand. It also dilates coronary arteries, improving blood flow to the heart muscle.

## **Alternate Names**

- ISDN
- **Brand names**: Isordil, Dilatrate-SR, Isochron, Iso-Bid, Sorbitrate

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Isosorbide dinitrate primarily affects the cardiovascular system, causing vasodilation and reducing cardiac preload.  This leads to decreased myocardial oxygen demand and improved coronary blood flow.
- **Pharmacokinetics**:
    - **Absorption**:  Rapidly absorbed following sublingual or oral administration.  The first-pass metabolism is extensive with oral administration, reducing bioavailability.  Extended-release formulations bypass some of this first-pass effect.
    - **Metabolism**: Extensively metabolized in the liver to isosorbide-2-mononitrate and isosorbide-5-mononitrate, both of which possess vasodilating activity.
    - **Elimination**: Primarily eliminated via renal excretion as glucuronide conjugates.
- **Mode of Action**:  Isosorbide dinitrate is denitrated intracellularly to release nitric oxide.  Nitric oxide activates guanylate cyclase, increasing cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which in turn activates protein kinase G, leading to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation.
- **Elimination pathways**:  Renal excretion as glucuronide derivatives of the denitrated metabolites.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Sublingual**: 2.5 to 5 mg for angina prophylaxis 15 minutes before activity, repeated every 2-3 hours as needed.
- **Oral (immediate release)**: Initial dose is 5 to 20 mg two or three times daily. Maintenance: 10 to 40 mg two to three times daily.
- **Oral (extended-release)**: 40 to 160 mg once daily.  A nitrate-free interval of at least 14 hours is necessary for immediate-release formulations and greater than 18 hours for extended-release to minimize tolerance.
- **Intravenous**: 2 to 12 mg/hour, titrated up to 20 mg/hour based on response.


#### **Children:**

Dosage must be determined by a doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: Start at the low end of the dosing range due to potential sensitivity to hypotensive effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: No specific dose adjustment is generally required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: No specific dose adjustment is generally required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Use with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypotension, or increased intracranial pressure.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation**: No specific dosage recommendations for intubation itself, but ISDN infusion may be used to manage blood pressure and myocardial ischemia during this procedure.
- **Surgical Procedures**:  Continue perioperative ISDN with heart rate and blood pressure monitoring.
- **Mechanical Ventilation**:  No specific dosage recommendations. Continue regular ISDN with appropriate monitoring.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**:  Continuous intravenous infusion may be used, titrated based on hemodynamic monitoring.
- **Emergency Situations**:  Sublingual administration for acute angina; intravenous infusion for acute heart failure.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustment may be needed based on clinical response and tolerability. A nitrate-free interval (usually overnight) is important for maintaining efficacy and preventing tolerance.
