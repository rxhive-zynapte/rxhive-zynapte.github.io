## **Usage**

- Itolizumab is prescribed for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adults. It has also been used to manage cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).  Its utility in treating other immune-mediated disorders like rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis is being explored.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Immunomodulator, monoclonal antibody (specifically, a humanized recombinant IgG1 monoclonal antibody).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Itolizumab targets the CD6 receptor on T lymphocytes, which plays a crucial role in T-cell activation and proliferation. By binding to the CD6 receptor, itolizumab downregulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-γ, TNFα, and IL-6), thus reducing inflammation.

## **Alternate Names**

- Alzumab-L™ (Brand name in India)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Itolizumab binds to domain 1 of the CD6 receptor on T-cells. This binding inhibits T-cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation, ultimately reducing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This modulation of the immune response leads to decreased inflammation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Administered intravenously, itolizumab reaches peak serum concentration at the end of the infusion. The elimination half-life is approximately 11 days. The precise metabolic pathways have not been fully elucidated.
- **Mode of Action:** Itolizumab binds with high affinity to the extracellular SRCR distal domain 1 of CD6, a cell surface glycoprotein expressed on T lymphocytes. This binding interferes with the CD6-ALCAM (activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule) pathway, disrupting the costimulatory signal required for T-cell activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily through protein catabolism, no specific CYP enzyme involvement has been noted.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Plaque Psoriasis:** 1.6 mg/kg body weight, administered as an intravenous infusion every 2 weeks for 12 weeks, followed by 1.6 mg/kg every 4 weeks for up to 24 weeks. Infuse the dose over 2 hours (approximately 50 mL in the first hour and the remaining 200 mL in the next hour).
- **Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) in COVID-19:**  Initial dose of 1.6 mg/kg intravenous infusion, followed by a weekly dose of 0.8 mg/kg if required, based on clinical response and inflammatory markers. The first infusion can be completed over 3-4 hours.

#### **Children:** Safety and efficacy have not been established in patients younger than 18 years.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are indicated.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustments are noted; use with caution.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments are noted; use with caution.
