      What is the difference between Ivabradine's use in angina and heart

      **A:** In both cases, it slows the heart rate.  However, in heart failure,
      the initial and target heart rate for dose adjustment might be different
      and determined by the physician in charge of the patient. For angina, the
      target heart rate is generally <60 bpm whereas in heart failure the target
      is between 50-60 bpm.  Furthermore, Ivabradine is used in conjunction with
      standard heart failure therapy, while in angina it can be used as
      monotherapy or in combination with beta-blockers.

## **Usage**

Ivabradine is prescribed for:

* **Chronic Stable Angina Pectoris:** In adults with normal sinus rhythm and a heart rate ≥ 70 bpm, it's used as an alternative to beta-blockers or in combination with them when beta-blockers alone are insufficient.
* **Chronic Heart Failure:**  In adults with NYHA class II to IV heart failure, systolic dysfunction, sinus rhythm, and heart rate ≥ 75 bpm. It's used in conjunction with standard therapy, including beta-blockers, or when beta-blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Ivabradine is a selective and specific *I<sub>f</sub>* current inhibitor, also classified as a cardiac metabolic modulator, and a sinus node inhibitor.

**Mechanism of Action:**  Ivabradine selectively and specifically inhibits the *I<sub>f</sub>* current in the sinoatrial node, which slows the heart rate and reduces oxygen demand by the heart. It doesn't affect myocardial contractility or ventricular repolarization.


## **Alternate Names**

Ivabradine is the generic name. A popular brand name is **Corlanor**. Procoralan is another brand name for this medication.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ivabradine's primary effect is to reduce heart rate. It acts on the *I<sub>f</sub>* current in the sinoatrial node, the heart's natural pacemaker. By inhibiting this current, it slows the rate of diastolic depolarization, thereby decreasing heart rate. It does not affect intracardiac conduction, myocardial contractility, or ventricular repolarization.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Ivabradine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within about 1 hour. Food slightly delays absorption but increases bioavailability.
* **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized by the liver, primarily via CYP3A4. The primary metabolite is an N-desmethylated active metabolite.
* **Elimination:** Excreted in the urine and feces, with approximately 70% renal excretion and 30% fecal elimination. The half-life is about 2 hours.


**Mode of Action:** Ivabradine specifically inhibits the *I<sub>f</sub>* current, also known as the "funny current," in the sinoatrial node. This current plays a key role in the slow diastolic depolarization phase of pacemaker cells.  By inhibiting the *I<sub>f</sub>* current, Ivabradine reduces the slope of this depolarization, prolonging the time it takes to reach the threshold for action potential generation, and thus slows the heart rate.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Ivabradine acts directly on the *I<sub>f</sub>* channels, specifically binding to HCN4 channels. It primarily interacts through CYP3A4 enzyme for its metabolism.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Chronic Stable Angina Pectoris:** Initial dose: 5 mg twice daily with meals.  After 3-4 weeks, the dose can be increased to 7.5 mg twice daily if the resting heart rate remains > 60 bpm and the patient is still symptomatic.  Maximum dose: 7.5 mg twice daily.
* **Chronic Heart Failure:** Initial dose: 5 mg twice daily with meals.  After 2 weeks, the dose can be increased to 7.5 mg twice daily if the resting heart rate is persistently > 60 bpm, or decreased to 2.5 mg twice daily if the heart rate is persistently < 50 bpm or if bradycardia symptoms occur.


#### **Children (Chronic Heart Failure due to Dilated Cardiomyopathy):**

* **<40 kg (oral solution):** Initial dose: 0.05 mg/kg twice daily with food. Adjust dose at 2-week intervals by 0.05 mg/kg to target a heart rate reduction of at least 20%, based on tolerability. Maximum dose: 0.2 mg/kg twice daily for children 6 months to <1 year; 0.3 mg/kg twice daily (up to a maximum of 7.5 mg twice daily) for children ≥1 year.
* **≥40 kg (tablets):** Initial dose: 2.5 mg twice daily with food. Adjust dose at 2-week intervals by 2.5 mg to target a heart rate reduction of at least 20%, based on tolerability. Maximum dose: 7.5 mg twice daily.



#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients (≥75 years):** Start with a lower dose (2.5 mg twice daily) and titrate upwards if necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary for mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance >15 mL/min). For severe renal impairment, dosage information is not available.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment for mild to moderate impairment. Contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider lower initial doses in patients with conduction defects or those in whom bradycardia could cause hemodynamic compromise.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Ivabradine's clinical use is primarily focused on chronic stable angina pectoris and chronic heart failure.  It is not indicated for use in acute settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like cardiac arrest.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments should be made based on heart rate, tolerability, and individual patient characteristics like age, renal/hepatic function, and concomitant medications (especially CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers).



## **Side Effects**

* Bradycardia
* Luminous phenomena (phosphenes)
* Headache
* Dizziness

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term effects are still being studied, but some potential concerns include chronic bradycardia, and visual disturbances.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs include severe bradycardia, syncope, and atrioventricular block, requiring dose reduction or discontinuation.
