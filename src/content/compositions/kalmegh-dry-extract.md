## **Usage**

Kalmegh dry extract, derived from the *Andrographis paniculata* plant, is traditionally used for its immunostimulant and antipyretic properties. It is prescribed for various conditions, including common cold, influenza, viral fevers (including dengue and chikungunya), and upper respiratory tract infections.  It's also used for osteoarthritis, and tonsilitis. It is classified as an antiviral, anti-inflammatory,  immunostimulant, and hepatoprotective herbal medicine.  It boosts the immune system and prevents viruses from attaching to cells, while reducing inflammation and offering liver protection.


## **Alternate Names**

Kalmegh is also known as  Green Chireta, King of bitters, Creat, Chuan Xin Lian,  and *Andrographis paniculata*.  Some brand names under which it is marketed include ParActin.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Kalmegh exerts its therapeutic effects through multiple mechanisms. Its main active component, andrographolide, has anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting iNOS and COX-2 expression. Andrographolide also exhibits antiviral activity by inhibiting viral replication and stimulating antibody production. Kalmegh extract is hepatoprotective, reducing liver damage from toxins and free radicals, due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It may also have hypolipidemic effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Limited data is available regarding the pharmacokinetics of Kalmegh dry extract. Andrographolide is absorbed orally and metabolized in the liver. Elimination pathways are not well-documented, but may involve hepatic and renal excretion.  

**Mode of Action:** Andrographolide, the primary active constituent, inhibits viral attachment to cells, reduces inflammation, and promotes antioxidant effects.
