## **Usage**

Ketotifen is prescribed for the prophylaxis of asthma and allergic conditions like allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis.  It is classified as an antihistamine and mast cell stabilizer.  Ketotifen's mechanism of action involves blocking histamine H1 receptors and stabilizing mast cells, thereby preventing the release of inflammatory mediators like histamine and leukotrienes that contribute to allergic reactions and bronchospasm.

## **Alternate Names**

Ketotifen fumarate (salt form)

**Brand Names:** Zaditen, Zaditor (ophthalmic), Alaway (ophthalmic), and various generics.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ketotifen exerts its therapeutic effects through a dual mechanism:

1. **H1-receptor antagonism:**  By blocking H1 receptors, ketotifen inhibits the effects of histamine, reducing symptoms like itching, sneezing, runny nose, and eye watering.

2. **Mast cell stabilization:** Ketotifen prevents mast cell degranulation, inhibiting the release of histamine, leukotrienes, and other inflammatory mediators. This action helps prevent bronchospasm and reduces airway inflammation in asthma.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Ketotifen is well-absorbed orally. Food may slightly delay absorption but doesn't significantly affect bioavailability.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver, with a small fraction undergoing first-pass metabolism.
* **Elimination:** Excreted mainly through the kidneys, with a small portion eliminated in the feces. The elimination half-life is approximately 21 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Ketotifen binds to H1 receptors, preventing histamine from binding and triggering downstream effects. Its mast cell stabilization involves inhibiting calcium influx into mast cells, thus preventing degranulation.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 1 mg twice daily (morning and evening).  The dosage can be increased to 2 mg twice daily if needed. To minimize initial sedation, a gradual dose increase over the first week is recommended, starting with 0.5 mg twice daily or 1 mg once daily in the evening, then titrating up to the full dose.


#### **Children:**
* **6 months to 3 years:** 0.05 mg/kg body weight twice daily (morning and evening). This is typically administered as 0.25 mL of syrup per kg of body weight.
* **3 years and older:** 1 mg twice daily (morning and evening).  

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient response and renal/hepatic function.  Start with a lower dose and monitor closely.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be required depending on the severity of renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, and dose adjustment may be considered in severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Ketotifen syrup contains carbohydrates and may require adjustments in patients with diabetes.  Caution is warranted in patients with epilepsy, as it may lower the seizure threshold.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Ketotifen is primarily used for long-term prevention of asthma attacks and allergic symptoms. It is not indicated for the relief of acute asthma exacerbations. Patients experiencing acute attacks should use a rapid-onset bronchodilator like salbutamol. Ketotifen is not typically used in the specific clinical settings mentioned (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, emergency situations).

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments should be made based on patient-specific factors like renal or hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, and patient response. Therapeutic drug monitoring might be helpful in some cases.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Drowsiness, dry mouth, weight gain, increased appetite, headache, dizziness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), seizures (especially in children), hepatitis, thrombocytopenia.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic complications are rare, but prolonged use may lead to weight gain.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any signs of hypersensitivity, seizures, or significant hepatic dysfunction require immediate attention.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to ketotifen.
* Concurrent use with oral antidiabetic agents.

## **Drug Interactions**

Ketotifen may potentiate the sedative effects of CNS depressants like alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioids. It can also interact with certain antidiabetic medications.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category C. Use with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding, weighing potential benefits against risks.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** H1-receptor antagonist and mast cell stabilizer.
* **Side Effects:** Drowsiness, dry mouth, weight gain, rarely seizures.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, concurrent use with oral antidiabetics.
* **Drug Interactions:** CNS depressants, some antidiabetics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category C, use with caution.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 1 mg BID, Children (6 months-3 years): 0.05mg/kg BID, Children (3+ years): 1 mg BID.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Asthma control, liver function tests, blood glucose (if applicable), weight.

## **Popular Combinations**

Ketotifen is often used in conjunction with inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators for asthma management.

## **Precautions**

Screen for allergies, epilepsy, diabetes, renal/hepatic dysfunction. Advise against alcohol and operating machinery if drowsiness occurs.
