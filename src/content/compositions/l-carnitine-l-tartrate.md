## **Usage**

- L-Carnitine L-Tartrate is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to enhance athletic performance, particularly in endurance and high-intensity exercise.  It may also be prescribed for medical conditions related to carnitine deficiency, such as primary carnitine deficiency, cardiomyopathy, and valproate-induced carnitine deficiency. It's also used in hemodialysis patients to mitigate carnitine loss.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Nutritional supplement, performance enhancer.  It can also be classified as a metabolic agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** L-Carnitine transports long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, where they are oxidized to produce energy. It also facilitates the removal of metabolic waste products from the mitochondria, preventing their accumulation.

## **Alternate Names**

- L-Carnitine, Vitamin BT,  L-3-hydroxy-4-N,N,N-trimethylaminobutyrate
- **Brand Names:**  Numerous brands exist, and availability varies regionally.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** L-Carnitine improves energy production by increasing fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria. It also has antioxidant properties, which may reduce exercise-induced muscle damage. It might also improve blood flow.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Readily absorbed in the small intestine after oral administration, particularly when taken with carbohydrates. L-Tartrate form has a rapid absorption rate.
    - **Metabolism:**  Metabolized in the liver.
    - **Elimination:**  Excreted primarily in urine, as free carnitine and acylcarnitines.
- **Mode of Action:** L-Carnitine acts as a carrier molecule, transporting long-chain fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane.  This process is crucial for fatty acid oxidation and energy production. This helps with energy production in heart and skeletal muscle tissues.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** No significant receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation is associated with L-Carnitine L-Tartrate.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 1000-4000 mg per day, divided into two doses, taken with carbohydrate-containing meals. The dose is typically taken before workouts to enhance athletic performance. For supporting recovery and weight loss, it can be taken after exercise.
- Maximum dosage limits vary but generally, doses up to 4000 mg/day are considered safe for most adults.

#### **Children:**

- Pediatric dosing should be determined by a physician based on the child's weight and specific medical condition.  Generally, 50-100 mg/kg/day, divided into doses, is used.
- **Pediatric Safety Considerations:** Close monitoring is essential.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be needed. Start with a lower dose and titrate based on tolerability and clinical response.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is necessary as L-Carnitine is primarily excreted by the kidneys.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised.  Monitor liver function tests.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consult a physician for individual dose adjustment based on specific conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- The use of L-Carnitine L-Tartrate in clinical settings, such as during intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, and in the ICU, typically relates to managing carnitine deficiency in critically ill patients or patients on long-term total parenteral nutrition. Dosing should be individualized based on the patient's needs and clinical condition.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments are based on patient factors such as renal function, hepatic function, and other comorbid conditions. Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism should also be considered.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, body odor.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Seizures (particularly in individuals with pre-existing seizure disorders).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Limited data on long-term effects are available.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Seizures, allergic reactions.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to L-Carnitine or any of its components.
- Severe renal impairment.
- History of seizures (relative contraindication).

## **Drug Interactions**

- Limited clinically significant drug interactions have been reported.
- Caution with anticoagulants (potential increased risk of bleeding).
- Potential interactions with thyroid hormone.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Consult a physician before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. L-Carnitine is present in breast milk, and potential effects on infants are not fully known.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Facilitates fatty acid transport into mitochondria for energy production.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, body odor; rarely seizures.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe renal impairment.
- **Drug Interactions:**  Limited, monitor with anticoagulants.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult a physician before use.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 1000-4000 mg/day; Children: 50-100 mg/kg/day.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function in patients with renal impairment.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Often combined with other athletic performance supplements.


## **Precautions**

- Assess renal function in patients with kidney disease.
- Monitor for gastrointestinal side effects.
- Caution in patients with seizure disorders.
