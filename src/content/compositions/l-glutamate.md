## **Usage**

- L-Glutamine, not L-Glutamate, is prescribed for short bowel syndrome (SBS) in patients receiving specialized nutritional support, particularly when used in conjunction with recombinant human growth hormone. It is also used for sickle cell disease.  L-Glutamate itself is not typically prescribed as a medication but is used in some specific clinical situations (e.g., during intubation or surgery) or as part of compounded parenteral nutrition.
- L-Glutamine is classified as a non-essential amino acid, though it becomes conditionally essential during metabolic stress. L-Glutamate is classified as an excitatory neurotransmitter.
- L-Glutamine's mechanism of action in SBS involves regulating gastrointestinal cell growth, function, and regeneration. In sickle cell disease, it reduces oxidative stress and improves erythrocyte hydration.  L-Glutamate's mechanism of action pertains to its role as a neurotransmitter, mediating excitatory signals in the central nervous system via various glutamate receptors.

## **Alternate Names**

- L-Glutamine: Glutamine, Glutaminol
- L-Glutamate: Glutamic acid, Glutamate, monosodium glutamate (MSG)
- Brand Names (L-Glutamine): Endari, GlutaSolve, NutreStore, SYMPT-X G.I.

## **How It Works**

**L-Glutamine:**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  In SBS, glutamine promotes enterocyte proliferation and reduces intestinal permeability. In sickle cell disease, it acts as an antioxidant and improves red blood cell deformability.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Orally administered glutamine is absorbed in the small intestine via active transport. It's metabolized primarily in the small intestine, liver, and kidneys, where it's converted to glutamate and ammonia.  It's eliminated renally, primarily as urea.
- **Mode of Action (SBS):** Glutamine serves as a primary energy source for intestinal cells, promoting cell growth and repair.
- **Mode of Action (Sickle Cell Disease):** Glutamine reduces oxidative stress by increasing the levels of glutathione, an important antioxidant. It also improves erythrocyte hydration by increasing intracellular water content.

**L-Glutamate:**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  As a neurotransmitter, L-Glutamate binds to various ionotropic (NMDA, AMPA, kainate) and metabotropic glutamate receptors, mediating excitatory synaptic transmission. Excessive L-Glutamate can lead to excitotoxicity.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Glutamate is absorbed from the small intestine via active transport. It's metabolized in the liver and other tissues, primarily through conversion to glutamine. It's eliminated primarily by renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** L-Glutamate binds to its receptors, leading to depolarization of postsynaptic neurons and propagation of nerve impulses.
- **Receptor Binding:** NMDA, AMPA, kainate receptors, mGluRs.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**
#### **Adults (L-Glutamine):**
- **Short Bowel Syndrome:** 30 g/day orally divided into six doses (5 g every 2-3 hours while awake) for up to 16 weeks.
- **Sickle Cell Disease:**  >65 kg: 15 g orally twice daily; 30-65 kg: 10 g orally twice daily; <30 kg: 5 g orally twice daily.


#### **Children (L-Glutamine):**
- **Short Bowel Syndrome:** Safety and efficacy not established.
- **Sickle Cell Disease:** Dosing as described above based on weight. For children under 5, dosing should be determined by a doctor.


#### **Special Cases (L-Glutamine):**
- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustment guidelines are available. Caution is advised due to potential age-related decline in renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Monitor renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Monitor liver function.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with diabetes, bipolar disorder, seizure disorders, or MSG sensitivity.

### **Clinical Use Cases (L-Glutamate):**  Dosages for L-Glutamate in clinical situations like intubation, surgical procedures, or ICU use should be individualized and based on patient needs and clinical context.  It's typically administered intravenously as part of a compounded parenteral nutrition solution.


### **Dosage Adjustments (L-Glutamine):** Dose adjustments should be based on patient tolerance, clinical response, and renal or hepatic function.
