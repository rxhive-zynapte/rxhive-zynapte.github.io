## **Usage**

- L-Glutamine is prescribed for sickle cell disease to reduce acute complications in adults and children 5 years and older. It is also used as a nutritional supplement for short bowel syndrome, particularly in patients receiving specialized nutritional support along with growth hormone. Additionally, it's used as a nutritional supplement in critical illness, trauma, and post-surgical recovery.  It's also used for glutamine deficiency, which can exacerbate intestinal permeability (a condition linked to Irritable Bowel Syndrome, where substances pass through the intestinal wall too readily).
- **Pharmacological classification:**  Amino acid, nutritional supplement.
- **Mechanism of action:**  While not fully understood, in sickle cell disease, L-glutamine likely addresses oxidative stress. It's a precursor for glutathione, a powerful antioxidant.  For short bowel syndrome and other conditions, it provides a crucial energy source for intestinal cells, promoting cell growth and repair. It also modulates the immune response.

## **Alternate Names**

- L-Glutamine is sometimes referred to simply as glutamine.
- Brand Name: Endari.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  L-Glutamine serves as a crucial energy source for rapidly dividing cells, particularly those in the gut and immune system. It supports intestinal integrity, immune function, and protein synthesis.  It also acts as a precursor for the synthesis of other amino acids, nucleotides, and the antioxidant glutathione. In sickle cell disease, it helps reduce oxidative stress and inflammation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** L-Glutamine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It's metabolized primarily in the intestines, liver, and kidneys. It's converted to glutamate and ammonia.  
- **Mode of action:**  L-Glutamine enters cells via amino acid transporters. Inside the cell, it participates in various metabolic pathways, including energy production, protein synthesis, and glutathione synthesis.  
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** While L-Glutamine itself does not directly bind to receptors, its metabolite glutamate acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion. It can also undergo conversion to other metabolites before excretion.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Short Bowel Syndrome:** 30 grams per day, divided into 6 doses of 5 grams each, taken at 2â€“3-hour intervals with meals or snacks while awake for up to 16 weeks.
- **Sickle Cell Disease:** 30 grams per day, divided into two doses of 15 grams each. For those weighing between 30 to 65 kilograms, 20 grams daily (10 grams twice daily); for those weighing less than 30 kilograms, 10 grams daily (5 grams twice daily).
- **Dietary Supplement:** 5 to 30 grams per day, divided into doses.

#### **Children:**

- **Sickle Cell Disease:** Children 5 years and older: dosing based on weight as described above.
- **Dietary Supplement:** 0.7 grams/kg body weight daily (safety of higher doses is not established).  Doses must be determined by a doctor for children under 5 for both Sickle Cell Disease and Short Bowel Syndrome.
- **Pediatric safety considerations:** Doses should be carefully adjusted based on weight and age.  Close monitoring is needed, and consultation with a pediatric specialist is highly recommended.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be needed due to potentially reduced kidney or liver function. Close monitoring is essential.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Routine monitoring of renal function is recommended.  Dose adjustment might be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Routine monitoring of liver function is recommended as L-Glutamine is metabolized to glutamate and ammonia. Dose adjustments may be needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration should be given for patients with diabetes, liver disease, bipolar disorder, or those on protein-restricted diets.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:**  L-Glutamine is often included in parenteral nutrition regimens for critically ill patients to support metabolic needs and gut integrity. Dosage depends on patient-specific factors and clinical status. Generally, 15-30 grams daily.
- **Emergency Situations:** No specific emergency dosage recommendations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
- Dose modifications may be necessary based on renal/hepatic function, other metabolic disorders, or the presence of concomitant medications.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Constipation, nausea, headache, abdominal pain, cough, pain in extremities, back pain, chest pain.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, swelling).
- Liver damage.
- Worsening of mania or hypomania in individuals with bipolar disorder.

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Insufficient data on long-term effects. However, theoretical concerns about ammonia buildup exist with chronic high doses in those with liver or kidney issues.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe allergic reactions requiring urgent medical attention.



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to L-glutamine.

- **Hormonal contraceptives:** May reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.
- **Cyclosporine:** Contraindicated due to increased risk of liver toxicity.
- **Rifampin:** May reduce the effectiveness of L-Glutamine.
- **Warfarin:** Careful monitoring required due to potential altered anticoagulant effects.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C. There's no reliable information on using it medicinally in larger amounts during pregnancy. Avoid use.
- **Fetal risks:** Insufficient human data to assess risks. Animal studies are lacking.
