## **Usage**

- L-Histidine is an essential amino acid, meaning it is not synthesized by the human body and must be obtained through diet.  While L-Histidine hydrochloride itself isn't typically prescribed as a standalone medication in the traditional sense, it's used as a component in various solutions, including parenteral nutrition and some infant formulas.  It also available as a dietary supplement.  L-Histidine plays a role in growth and repair of tissues, and is involved in various metabolic processes.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**  It can be classified as a nutrient replenisher when used in parenteral nutrition.

- **Mechanism of Action:**  L-Histidine is crucial for protein synthesis, and is a precursor to histamine, a neurotransmitter and mediator in immune responses.  It is also involved in the formation of carnosine, a dipeptide that acts as a buffer and antioxidant in muscle tissue.

## **Alternate Names**

- L-Histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, L-α-Amino-β-(4-imidazolyl)propionic acidmonohydrochloride.  
- Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and formulation.  It is commonly found as a generic supplement.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  L-Histidine, once absorbed, participates in protein synthesis and acts as a precursor to histamine.  Histamine plays a role in various physiological processes, including immune response, gastric acid secretion, and neurotransmission. Carnosine, synthesized from L-histidine and beta-alanine, has antioxidant and pH-buffering properties in muscle tissue.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** The absorption of L-histidine from the gut is efficient. Once absorbed it is metabolized in the body, with some being converted to histamine or carnosine. Elimination primarily occurs through renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:**  At the cellular level, L-Histidine is incorporated into proteins during translation. Its conversion to histamine is catalyzed by histidine decarboxylase.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Histamine, a metabolite of L-Histidine, acts on histamine receptors (H1, H2, H3, H4), mediating its diverse physiological effects.
- **Elimination Pathways:** It is primarily excreted in the urine along with other amino acids and nitrogenous waste products.

## **Dosage**

Dosage recommendations for L-Histidine supplementation vary greatly due to differences in product formulations. There is no established standard dosage for L-histidine.  It is essential to follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer of the specific product being used.  General recommendations:

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Supplemental doses of up to 4 grams per day have been used in some studies.

#### **Children:**

- Pediatric dosing guidelines have not been well-established.  Consult a healthcare professional before giving L-Histidine supplements to children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and increase gradually as needed.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary.  Consult a healthcare professional.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically recommended.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Exercise caution and consult a healthcare professional.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The following dosage guidelines pertain to L-histidine as a component of parenteral nutrition and not for standalone L-Histidine supplementation.  Dosage recommendations for L-histidine hydrochloride for specific medical situations can differ significantly.

- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations:** In these contexts, L-Histidine is typically provided as part of a parenteral nutrition regimen, and its dosage will be determined by the overall nutritional needs of the patient.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments should be made under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Considerations include:

- Renal/hepatic function, concurrent medication, overall clinical picture, and the specific formulation being used.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- L-Histidine supplementation is generally well-tolerated at recommended doses.  Some individuals might experience mild gastrointestinal discomfort.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

-  Serious side effects are rare with standard dosages.

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Long-term effects of high doses are unknown and more research is needed.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Rare but potential ADRs may include allergic reactions.

## **Contraindications**

- **Folic acid deficiency:**  L-Histidine can interfere with folic acid metabolism.
- Hypersensitivity to L-Histidine.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Limited information is available on specific drug interactions with L-Histidine.  Consult a doctor if taking other medications.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- The safety of supplemental L-Histidine during pregnancy and breastfeeding hasn't been definitively established.  Consult a healthcare professional before use.
