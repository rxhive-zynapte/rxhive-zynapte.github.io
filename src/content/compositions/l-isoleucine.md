## **Usage**

- L-Isoleucine is primarily prescribed for managing nutritional deficiencies, particularly in individuals who cannot obtain sufficient amounts through their diet.  It is crucial for various physiological processes, including growth,  immune function, protein metabolism,  and energy production. It is one of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and is considered essential, meaning the body cannot produce it and must obtain it from dietary sources.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Essential amino acid,  nutritional supplement.

## **Alternate Names**

- (2S,3S)-2-amino-3-methylpentanoic acid
- (2S,3S)-2-amino-3-methylvaleric acid
-  There are no widely recognized brand names specifically for L-Isoleucine, as it is usually marketed as a component of  BCAA supplements or as part of total protein supplements.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** L-Isoleucine plays a vital role in protein synthesis, particularly within muscle tissue. It contributes to  hemoglobin synthesis, blood sugar regulation, and energy levels.  It also aids wound healing and immune function. In conditions like liver cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, burns, trauma, sepsis, and malnutrition, L-Isoleucine helps to prevent muscle protein breakdown.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** L-Isoleucine is absorbed in the small intestine through active transport mechanisms. It undergoes first-pass metabolism in the liver. The breakdown of L-Isoleucine mainly takes place in the muscles, providing a source of energy during physical activity.
- **Mode of Action:** L-Isoleucine's mode of action involves stimulating protein synthesis via the mTOR pathway, promoting glucose uptake by muscles, and influencing the production of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine.


## **Dosage**

Dosages are typically calculated per kilogram of body weight and are determined by a clinician or dietitian based on individual patient needs.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for adults is 19 mg/kg of body weight daily. For a 70kg adult, that would be 1330 mg daily. However, this RDA isn't a therapeutic dosage and should be viewed as a minimum daily requirement from all sources.
-  Therapeutic dosages can vary significantly depending on the specific clinical situation and should be determined by a healthcare professional. For example, the WHO recommends 20 mg per kg of body weight daily.

#### **Children:**
- Pediatric dosing is determined based on weight, age, and medical condition. Dosage should be established by a clinician or dietitian.

#### **Special Cases:**
- Dosage adjustments are made based on metabolic changes, organ function, and comorbidities. Expert guidance is crucial in these cases.


### **Clinical Use Cases**
- Dosage is dependent on individual clinical needs and determined by a qualified healthcare professional.
- L-Isoleucine, often as part of a BCAA mixture or as a complete amino acid solution,  is used in clinical settings such as intensive care units (ICUs), for surgical patients, and for those on mechanical ventilation or receiving parenteral nutrition, especially in cases of malnutrition or protein-energy undernutrition.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
-  Nausea, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, fatigue, and headache might occur, particularly with higher doses.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Allergic reactions, including hives, swelling, difficulty breathing, and anaphylaxis, though rare, are serious and require immediate attention.
- Kidney stones and liver damage are other rare but serious side effects.

## **Contraindications**
- Hypersensitivity to L-Isoleucine or any component of the formulation.
- Acute liver failure.
- Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
- Branched-chain ketoaciduria.
- Renal impairment.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Levodopa (used for Parkinson's disease)
- Certain diabetes medications (metformin, insulin)
- Corticosteroids (prednisone)
- Thyroid hormones (levothyroxine)



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be under the guidance of a physician.  Data on safety are limited.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Stimulates protein synthesis, regulates blood glucose levels, and influences neurotransmitter production.
- **Side Effects:**  Nausea, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, fatigue, headache (common); allergic reactions, kidney stones, liver damage (rare).
- **Contraindications:**  Hypersensitivity, acute liver failure, ALS, branched-chain ketoaciduria, renal impairment.
- **Drug Interactions:** Levodopa, diabetes medications, corticosteroids, thyroid hormones.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Consult a physician; limited safety data.
- **Dosage:** Determined by a clinician or dietitian based on individual needs.

## **Popular Combinations**
- L-Isoleucine is often combined with the other two branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs): L-leucine and L-valine. These combinations can be used to enhance athletic performance and promote muscle protein synthesis.


## **Precautions**
- Assess for allergies and any pre-existing medical conditions, including liver or kidney dysfunction and diabetes.
- Monitor patients for potential side effects.
