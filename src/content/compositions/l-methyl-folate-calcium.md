## **Usage**

- L-Methylfolate Calcium is prescribed as a medical food for the distinct nutritional requirements of individuals with conditions like major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia, particularly those experiencing negative symptoms or cognitive impairment. It's also used to address hyperhomocysteinemia (high homocysteine levels).  It is often used adjunctively with antidepressants in MDD and with antipsychotics in schizophrenia.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Metabolic Agent, Medical Food.
- **Mechanism of Action:** L-Methylfolate is the biologically active form of folate (vitamin B9). It plays a crucial role in various metabolic processes, including DNA synthesis, cell division, and neurotransmitter synthesis. It's essential for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine, thereby reducing homocysteine levels.  It is readily utilized by the body, bypassing the metabolic steps required for folic acid conversion.

## **Alternate Names**

- Levomefolate Calcium
- (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolate calcium salt
- (6S)-5-MTHF-Ca
- MetafolinÂ® (a common, but not universal, brand name for L-methylfolate, not specific to the calcium salt form.  The calcium salt form is less common than other forms of L-methylfolate such as the glucosamine salt.)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** L-Methylfolate participates in one-carbon metabolism, essential for DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation.  It facilitates the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines (building blocks of DNA and RNA). It aids in neurotransmitter synthesis by acting as a cofactor for enzymes involved in these processes.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Administered orally, L-Methylfolate is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Being the active form of folate, it doesn't require metabolic conversion. It crosses the blood-brain barrier, making it effective in addressing neurological conditions. Elimination pathways are primarily renal.
- **Mode of Action:**  As a substrate for various enzymes including dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TS), L-Methylfolate is involved in cellular pathways producing DNA and RNA.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** L-Methylfolate does not directly bind to receptors. It acts as a cofactor for enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis, thereby indirectly modulating neurotransmitter activity.
