## **Usage**

L-methylfolate, the bioactive form of folate (vitamin B9), is primarily used to treat folate deficiency and conditions related to it, such as megaloblastic anemia.  It is also used as adjunctive therapy in patients with major depressive disorder who have folate deficiency, or in those with schizophrenia and hyperhomocysteinemia related to folate deficiency. It supports the normal function of the immune system, normal blood formation, and reduces tiredness and fatigue. In women of childbearing age, it helps prevent neural tube defects in the developing fetus.

It's pharmacological classification is vitamin.

L-methylfolate works by providing the body with the readily usable form of folate, bypassing the metabolic steps required for converting folic acid into its active form. This is particularly important for individuals with certain genetic variations (e.g., MTHFR gene mutations) affecting folate metabolism.

## **Alternate Names**

- Levomefolic acid
- 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF)
- 5-MTHF calcium salt
- (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid
- (6S)-5-MTHF


**Brand Names:** Deplin, Denovo, Elfolate, L-Methylfolate Forte, XaQuil XR, L-Methylfolate Formula, Zervalx, Vilofane-DP, Duleek-DP, Deplin FC


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** L-methylfolate is essential for various physiological processes, including DNA synthesis, cell division, and the production of red blood cells.  It also plays a crucial role in the synthesis of neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, influencing mood regulation and cognitive function. By lowering homocysteine levels, it contributes to cardiovascular health.

**Pharmacokinetics:** L-methylfolate is absorbed readily in the gastrointestinal tract, reaching peak plasma concentrations within approximately one hour.  It is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily through the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** L-methylfolate acts as a cofactor for enzymes involved in one-carbon transfer reactions, including those necessary for DNA and RNA synthesis, amino acid metabolism, and methylation reactions. These reactions are vital for various cellular processes, growth, and development.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Interactions:** L-methylfolate does not directly bind to receptors but acts as a substrate and cofactor for key enzymes involved in folate metabolism.  It participates in crucial metabolic cycles within the body, influencing the synthesis and function of various biomolecules.


**Elimination:**  Primarily renal excretion.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Data limited; exercise caution.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Data limited; exercise caution.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor closely, especially in those with a history of bipolar disorder or vitamin B12 deficiency.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosage in clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations is not specifically different but may need adjustments based on the patient's individual needs and the clinical context. It's advisable to consult specialist literature and guidelines for these specific situations.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosages should be adjusted based on individual patient responses and clinical situations under the guidance of a healthcare professional. Factors to consider include renal/hepatic function, other medical conditions, concomitant medications, and patient tolerance.



## **Side Effects**

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions such as rash, hives, swelling (especially of the face, lips, tongue, or throat), and difficulty breathing.


### **Long-Term Effects**

Limited data exists on the long-term effects of high-dose L-methylfolate.  Monitoring is recommended, especially concerning the potential masking of vitamin B12 deficiency.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

L-methylfolate is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, even essential during pregnancy for proper fetal development. However, high doses should only be taken under medical supervision. It's crucial to discuss dosage and potential risks with a healthcare provider.  Folate is excreted in breast milk, but the amounts are generally considered safe for nursing infants.



## **Drug Profile Summary**
