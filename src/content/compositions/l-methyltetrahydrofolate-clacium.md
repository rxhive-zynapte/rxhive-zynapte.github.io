# L-Methyltetrahydrofolate Calcium

## **Usage**

- L-Methyltetrahydrofolate Calcium is primarily prescribed to address metabolic imbalances associated with depression and schizophrenia. It is also used to treat low folate levels and anemia. It may also be used for major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Further, it can help prevent DNA changes that may lead to cancer.
- **Pharmacological Classification**: Medical food, vitamin supplement.
- **Mechanism of Action**: L-Methyltetrahydrofolate Calcium is the active form of folate, a B vitamin crucial for DNA synthesis, cell division, and neurotransmitter production. Unlike folic acid, it doesn't require metabolic conversion and directly enters the central nervous system, supporting neurotransmitter function and potentially improving symptoms of mental disorders. It is also important for the formation of red blood cells.

## **Alternate Names**

- L-Methylfolate Calcium
- L-5-MTHF-Ca
- Metafolin (brand name)
- Levomefolate calcium
- Mybro-LMF Tablet (this tablet contains additional vitamins)
- Fol-XT Tablet (this tablet contains additional vitamins)
- Deplin (brand name)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**:  L-Methyltetrahydrofolate Calcium acts as a cofactor in one-carbon transfer reactions essential for DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation. It supports the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines (building blocks of DNA and RNA) and facilitates methylation reactions impacting gene expression and neurotransmitter metabolism.
- **Pharmacokinetics**: L-Methyltetrahydrofolate is absorbed readily in the gastrointestinal tract and is transported across the blood-brain barrier.  It is thought that elimination pathways involve both hepatic and renal clearance after metabolism.
- **Mode of Action**: It is involved in single carbon unit transfer and is reduced to tetrahydrofolate to be active. It plays a role in nucleic acid synthesis and homocysteine remethylation and interconversion of serine and glycine amino acids.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation**: It doesn't bind to specific receptors but acts as a cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA synthesis and neurotransmitter production, indirectly modulating neurotransmitter levels (e.g., serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine). It corrects vitamin B12 deficiency, thereby helping in treating certain anemias and nerve problems.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 7.5 mg to 15 mg daily, orally, with or without food, as directed by a physician.

#### **Children:**

- Dosage should be determined by a pediatrician based on the child's weight, age, and medical condition.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: Standard adult dosage, with close monitoring for potential side effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Dosage adjustment may be necessary; consult a nephrologist.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**:  Dosage adjustment may be necessary; consult a hepatologist.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Consider individual patient factors and comorbid conditions (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease) when determining the optimal dosage.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- The provided sources do not specifically mention the dosage recommendations for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Dosage adjustments in these situations should be determined on a case-by-case basis under the guidance of a specialist.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Modifications may be necessary depending on renal/hepatic function, metabolic disorders, and potential drug interactions.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Nausea
- Stomach upset
- Confusion
- Sleeplessness

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (skin rash, hives, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)

- Antiepileptic drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid): May reduce folate absorption or enhance antiepileptic metabolism, potentially leading to breakthrough seizures.
- Capecitabine: Folinic acid may increase its toxicity.
- Alcohol: May interfere with absorption.
- Other medications, OTC drugs, and supplements: Consult a physician to evaluate potential interactions.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Consult a physician before use during pregnancy and breastfeeding, though it is generally considered safe.
- Adequate folate intake is crucial during pregnancy for fetal development.
