## **Usage**

- L-Ornithine L-Aspartate (LOLA) is prescribed for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy, a neuropsychiatric syndrome associated with liver dysfunction, particularly in conditions like liver cirrhosis, acute and chronic hepatitis, fatty liver, and hyperammonemia. It is also used to improve liver function in cirrhosis and potentially support muscle function.  
- **Pharmacological Classification**: Hepatoprotective agent.
- **Mechanism of Action**: LOLA facilitates the detoxification of ammonia in the liver through two key pathways: urea synthesis and glutamine synthesis. Ornithine activates enzymes involved in the urea cycle and acts as a substrate for urea synthesis. Aspartate participates in glutamine synthesis, binding ammonia to form glutamine, a non-toxic form for ammonia excretion.

## **Alternate Names**

- LOLA.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**:  LOLA reduces elevated ammonia levels in the blood, improving symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy such as confusion, altered consciousness, and neuromuscular disturbances. It may also contribute to improved energy production in liver cells.
- **Pharmacokinetics**:  Ornithine and aspartate are rapidly absorbed after oral administration. They have a short elimination half-life (0.3-0.4 hours). Aspartate is partially excreted unchanged in the urine, while ornithine is metabolized in the urea cycle.
- **Mode of Action**: LOLA enhances the urea cycle, the primary pathway for ammonia detoxification in the liver. It also promotes glutamine synthesis, which further contributes to ammonia removal.
- **Elimination Pathways**: Primarily renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Oral: 1-2 sachets or tablets, 1-3 times daily, dissolved in liquid, taken with or without food.
- IV infusion: Up to 4 ampoules (20g) daily, diluted in infusion solution (max 6 ampoules/500ml). Maximum infusion rate: 5g/hour.

#### **Children:**

- Not established. Use with caution and under strict medical supervision.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: No specific adjustments, but monitor renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Contraindicated in severe renal impairment (creatinine > 3mg/100ml). Adjust dosage in moderate impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Adjust infusion rate to prevent nausea and vomiting.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Use with caution in patients with metabolic disorders like urea cycle disorders or maple syrup urine disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Dosing in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations is not specifically defined. Dosage adjustments should be based on individual patient needs and the severity of hepatic encephalopathy.
