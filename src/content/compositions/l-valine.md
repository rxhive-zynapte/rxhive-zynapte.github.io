## **Usage**

- L-Valine is prescribed for nutritional deficiencies, especially in individuals with certain medical conditions or those on restrictive diets. It is also used to support muscle growth and recovery in athletes, though evidence for these uses is not conclusive.  It is specifically indicated for the dietary management of inborn errors of metabolism affecting branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism, such as Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD), Methylmalonic Aciduria (MMA), and Propionic Aciduria (PA).
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Essential amino acid, branched-chain amino acid (BCAA), nutritional supplement.
- **Mechanism of Action:** L-Valine is an essential amino acid, meaning the body cannot produce it and it must be obtained through diet or supplementation.  It is one of the three branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), along with leucine and isoleucine, primarily metabolized in muscle tissue.  BCAAs contribute to protein synthesis,  reduce protein breakdown, and can serve as an energy source during exercise. L-Valine specifically contributes to muscle protein synthesis and helps regulate blood sugar levels.


## **Alternate Names**

-  Val, 2-Amino-3-methylbutanoic acid, L-Valine.
- Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and formulation. (e.g., Bracia, KIDMIN).  Many BCAA supplements contain L-Valine in combination with L-Leucine and L-Isoleucine.  


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** L-Valine primarily acts on muscle tissue by stimulating protein synthesis and reducing protein breakdown.  It can also be used as an energy source during intense physical activity. It is crucial for maintaining nitrogen balance in the body.  It is also thought to play a role in cognitive function and immune health, but more research is needed.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** L-Valine is absorbed in the small intestine and transported to the muscles and other tissues.  It is metabolized primarily in the muscles.  Excess valine is excreted by the kidneys in urine.
- **Mode of Action:** L-Valine, as a BCAA, activates the mTOR pathway, which regulates cell growth and stimulates protein synthesis.  
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** While BCAAs can influence neurotransmitter levels in the brain, L-Valine's specific role in neurotransmitter modulation is less clear. High valine concentrations can compete with leucine at the blood-brain barrier, potentially modulating leucine's entry into the brain.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

The dosage of L-Valine varies depending on the patient's age, weight, medical condition, and reason for supplementation.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- For dietary deficiency: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 26 mg/kg body weight per day. This translates to roughly 1.8 grams per day for a 70 kg adult. However, this is a general guideline, and individual needs may vary.
-  For athletes and other individuals looking to support muscle growth or recovery: Dosages can range from several grams to upwards of 10 grams per day, often split into multiple doses. Such high doses are usually part of a BCAA supplement containing a combination of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. A 2:1:1 ratio of leucine:isoleucine:valine is often recommended.
- For specific medical conditions: Dosage should be determined by a clinician or dietitian based on individual needs.


#### **Children:**

- Pediatric dosing should be determined by a healthcare professional based on the child's age, weight, and medical condition.
-  Children with specific metabolic disorders require careful dosage management under strict medical supervision.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on renal function and overall health status.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Dosage reduction may be required based on the degree of renal dysfunction.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Caution is advised, and dosage adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**:  Individualized dosing based on the specific comorbid condition is required.  For example, patients with diabetes should monitor their blood sugar closely when supplementing with BCAAs.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Dosage recommendations for specific medical settings, such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations, should be determined by a physician or registered dietitian and are based on the patient's individual nutritional needs and medical condition.  L-Valine is typically provided as part of parenteral nutrition formulations in these settings.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dosage adjustments are necessary based on renal function, hepatic function, metabolic disorders, and other medical conditions.  Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism may also influence dosing.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain (especially at high doses).
- Fatigue, headache, dizziness (less common).


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Skin tingling, hallucinations (at extremely high doses).
-  Worsening of symptoms in individuals with MSUD or other inborn errors of BCAA metabolism.

### **Long-Term Effects**

-  Potential for neurological issues with prolonged high doses.  
- Individuals with MSUD, MMA, or PA are at risk of serious complications if valine intake is not carefully managed.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Allergic reactions (rare).
- Exacerbation of metabolic disorders.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to L-Valine.
- Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD).
- Branched-chain ketoaciduria.
- Advanced liver or kidney disease (caution advised).

## **Drug Interactions**

-  Potential interaction with medications for Parkinson's disease (e.g., Levodopa) and diabetes medications.
-  Consult with a physician regarding potential interactions with other medications, especially if the patient has underlying health conditions.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy**: Not recommended unless medically necessary due to a specific deficiency.
- **Breastfeeding**: Insufficient data on safety; avoid unless specifically directed by a physician.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Essential amino acid, promotes protein synthesis and reduces protein breakdown in muscle tissue, provides energy.
