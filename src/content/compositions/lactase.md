## **Usage**

Lactase is prescribed for lactose intolerance. Its pharmacological classification is as a digestive enzyme. Lactase works by breaking down lactose, a sugar found in milk products, into simpler sugars (glucose and galactose) that can be easily absorbed by the small intestine. This prevents the symptoms of lactose intolerance, such as diarrhea, gas, and bloating.

## **Alternate Names**

Lactase is also known as lactase enzyme. Some popular brand names include Lactaid, Lactaid Fast Act, SureLac, and Lac-Dose. Colief Infant Drops is a brand specifically for infants.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Lactase supplements act locally in the small intestine, where they hydrolyze lactose into glucose and galactose. These simpler sugars are then absorbed into the bloodstream.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Lactase enzyme supplements are not absorbed into the bloodstream.  They work directly in the digestive tract. The enzyme itself is likely digested like other proteins. As the enzyme is not systemically absorbed, hepatic or renal elimination pathways are not applicable.

**Mode of Action:** Lactase is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of lactose into glucose and galactose.  This occurs at the brush border of the small intestine.  The enzyme is not absorbed but works directly in the gut lumen. There is no receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation involved in the action of lactase supplements.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
The typical dose ranges from 3,000 to 9,000 IU taken with the first bite of food containing lactose. For higher lactose content, higher doses might be required. Dosing can be repeated if dairy is consumed later in the meal.

#### **Children:**
Dosing for children over 4 years of age is generally the same as for adults, starting with a low dose and increasing based on symptoms and lactose intake. For children under 4, consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosing guidance (Colief Infant Drops are available for infants).

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically needed. However, consider starting with a lower dose and titrating up based on tolerance.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  For patients with diabetes, consider the sugar content of certain lactase products and adjust diabetes medications if necessary.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Lactase is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its use is primarily limited to managing dietary lactose intake.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage should be adjusted based on individual response and the amount of lactose being consumed. Start with a low dose and gradually increase until symptoms are controlled.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Lactase is generally well-tolerated.  In rare instances, some individuals may experience mild gastrointestinal discomfort, such as gas, bloating, or cramps.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) are rare but possible.

### **Long-Term Effects**

No long-term adverse effects are known to be associated with lactase use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Anaphylaxis is a rare but serious ADR that requires immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

Lactase is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to lactase or any component of the formulation.  Those with galactosemia should also avoid lactase.


## **Drug Interactions**

No significant drug interactions are known with lactase.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Lactase is generally considered safe to use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Hydrolyzes lactose to glucose and galactose in the small intestine.
* **Side Effects:** Generally well-tolerated; rarely, gas, bloating, cramps, or allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to lactase, galactosemia.
* **Drug Interactions:** None known.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe.
* **Dosage:** 3,000â€“9,000 IU with meals containing dairy.  Adjust according to individual needs and lactose intake.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for symptom relief and resolution of lactose intolerance symptoms.

## **Popular Combinations**

Lactase is often combined with other digestive enzymes like amylase and protease to promote overall digestive health and relieve symptoms associated with several food intolerances, however, its use is primarily limited to addressing lactose intolerance. There are no specific medical guidelines for such combinations, and their efficacy remains largely unstudied. 

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Evaluate for true lactose intolerance. Rule out other conditions with similar symptoms.
* **Specific Populations:** No specific precautions apart from general recommendations.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  No specific lifestyle restrictions.
