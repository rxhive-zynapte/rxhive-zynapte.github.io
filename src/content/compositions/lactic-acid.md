      How does lactic acid work for dry skin?**


      **A:**  Lactic acid acts as a humectant, attracting and retaining moisture
      in the skin. It also helps exfoliate dead skin cells, revealing smoother,
      hydrated skin underneath.

      Can lactic acid be used on the face?**


      **A:** Yes, lactic acid can be used on the face, but it is essential to
      start with a lower concentration (around 5%) to assess tolerance and
      gradually increase as needed.

## **Usage**

Lactic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA), is primarily used topically for dry skin. It exfoliates by removing dead skin cells from the stratum corneum and promotes skin hydration. While used for other skin conditions like acne, aging skin, warts, and canker sores, scientific evidence supporting these uses is limited. Orally, lactic acid is present in fermented foods, but its medicinal use in this form lacks sufficient safety and efficacy data.  It is also used vaginally as a contraceptive.

## **Alternate Names**

- 2-Hydroxypropionic acid
- Acide 2-hydroxypropionique
- Lac-Hydrin (brand name for ammonium lactate cream)
- Phexxi (brand name for lactic acid/citric acid/potassium bitartrate vaginal gel)

## **How It Works**

**Topical:** Lactic acid acts as a humectant, drawing moisture into the skin. It reduces corneocyte cohesion, facilitating exfoliation. The exact mechanism is not fully understood but may involve disrupting the bonds between dead skin cells. It appears to thicken deeper skin layers, potentially improving firmness. Absorption is minimal with topical application.

**Vaginal:**  When used vaginally as a contraceptive, the combination of lactic acid, citric acid, and potassium bitartrate maintains vaginal pH in an acidic range which decreases sperm motility.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (Topical):**
- Creams/lotions: Apply to affected area twice daily. Concentrations up to 10% are considered safe for facial use, while concentrations up to 15% can be used on the body.
- Higher concentrations (above 15%) should only be used under dermatological supervision.

#### **Children (Topical):** 
- Safety and efficacy established in children as young as 2 years old.
- Follow product-specific guidelines or consult a dermatologist for appropriate concentrations and application frequency.


#### **Special Cases (Topical):**
- Elderly Patients:  No specific dosage adjustments are generally needed but caution is advised, especially with higher concentrations.
- Renal/Hepatic Impairment: No dose adjustments are typically required for topical use.
- Pregnant/Breastfeeding: Topical use is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding in concentrations below 10%.  Vaginal use has not been studied and should be avoided.


### **Clinical Use Cases**
Dosage is primarily relevant for topical preparations. Specific medical settings for other routes of administration lack sufficient clinical data.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
Adjustments may be needed for patients with sensitive skin. Start with lower concentrations and increase gradually as tolerated. Discontinue if irritation persists.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects (Topical)**
- Burning
- Stinging
- Itching
- Redness (erythema)
- Peeling

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects (Topical)**
Severe skin irritation (with high concentrations)

### **Long-Term Effects**
No significant long-term effects are reported with topical use within recommended concentrations.

## **Contraindications**
- Hypersensitivity to lactic acid or any component of the formulation.
- Active eczema, psoriasis, or rosacea (for topical peels)



## **Drug Interactions**

**Topical:** Limited information on drug interactions is available. Concomitant use with other topical medications, especially exfoliants, may increase the risk of irritation. 

**Vaginal:** Do not use with contraceptive vaginal rings.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Topical lactic acid (concentrations below 10%) is considered likely safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Lactic acid is a normal component of breast milk, and levels may increase after intense exercise without apparent harm to infants. Vaginal use as a contraceptive has not been studied during pregnancy or breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
- **Mechanism of Action:** Exfoliates dead skin cells, hydrates skin.
- **Side Effects:** Burning, stinging, itching, redness, peeling (topical).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to lactic acid.
- **Drug Interactions:** Limited information available (topical), do not use vaginally with contraceptive rings.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Topical use generally safe in low concentrations. Vaginal use not studied.
- **Dosage:** Topical: Apply twice daily, concentrations vary.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for skin irritation with topical use.

## **Popular Combinations**
Combined with other AHAs in some skincare products for enhanced exfoliation.

## **Precautions**

- Test on a small skin area before widespread application.
- Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes.
- Use sunscreen during the day when using AHAs, as they can increase sun sensitivity.
