## **Usage**

*Lactobacillus casei* is a probiotic bacterium used primarily to support digestive health. While it's been used for various conditions like eczema, constipation, and high blood pressure, robust scientific evidence supporting these uses is lacking as of the current date (2025-02-16).

It's classified as a probiotic, a class of live microorganisms conferring health benefits when administered adequately.

Its mechanism of action is multifaceted, likely involving competitive exclusion of pathogenic bacteria, enhancement of immune modulation, and improved nutrient absorption.

## **Alternate Names**

*Lactobacillus casei* was reclassified in April 2020 to *Lacticaseibacillus casei.*  Product labels may still use the older name. Some strains previously classified as *L. casei* are now *Lacticaseibacillus paracasei.*

Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer and specific formulation.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** *L. casei* primarily exerts its effects within the gastrointestinal tract.  It produces lactic acid, contributing to a more acidic environment that may inhibit the growth of certain harmful bacteria. It also competes with pathogens for resources and adhesion sites, potentially limiting their ability to colonize the gut.  Additionally, it can modulate immune responses, influencing cytokine production and potentially reducing inflammation.

**Pharmacokinetics:** *L. casei* is administered orally, typically in food products or supplements. While it can survive transit through the stomach and reach the intestines, it's not absorbed into the bloodstream.  It colonizes the gut temporarily and is eventually eliminated through the feces. Specific metabolic pathways or interactions with CYP enzymes are not well-characterized for probiotics.

**Mode of Action:**  The precise mechanisms are still under investigation, but competitive exclusion, lactic acid production, and immunomodulation appear to be key. No specific receptor binding or enzyme inhibition has been identified as the primary mechanism for *L. casei*.


## **Dosage**

Dosage guidelines are not firmly established and can vary greatly between products.  It's crucial to consult product labels and a healthcare professional for specific recommendations. Dosages are usually expressed in colony-forming units (CFUs).

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

A typical starting dose can range from 10-20 billion CFUs daily. Some sources recommend up to 100 billion CFUs for specific conditions.

#### **Children:**

Dosing for children varies based on age and the specific product. Some sources suggest starting with a quarter of the adult dose for children under 6, half the adult dose for ages 6-12, and the full adult dose for teens.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Some sources recommend 10-20 billion CFUs for general maintenance, with potentially higher doses (20-50 billion CFUs) for specific conditions.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically recommended. However, careful monitoring is advised.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically recommended. However, careful monitoring is advised.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage should be individualized based on the specific condition and overall health status.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, and ICU use are not well-defined for *L. casei.*  Its use in these settings is not routine, and benefits are not clearly established.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be needed based on individual responses and tolerance. Start with a low dose and gradually increase, monitoring for side effects.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Mild gas and bloating are the most frequently reported side effects.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

In rare cases, and especially in individuals with compromised immune systems, probiotics can cause infections (bacteremia or fungemia).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term effects of *L. casei* are not well-studied.


## **Contraindications**

Individuals with severely weakened immune systems, short gut syndrome, or those who are critically ill should exercise caution and consult a healthcare professional before using probiotics.  


## **Drug Interactions**

Limited information is available on specific drug interactions with *L. casei*.  Some sources suggest potential interactions with antibiotics and antifungals. It's important to inform your healthcare provider about all medications and supplements you are taking.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

*L. casei* is considered possibly safe during pregnancy when taken orally at appropriate doses. Studies have investigated its use starting in the second or third trimester.  Information regarding its safety during breastfeeding is limited, but no specific concerns are anticipated with appropriate use under medical supervision.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Probiotic exerting effects through competitive exclusion, lactic acid production, and immunomodulation.
* **Side Effects:** Generally well-tolerated; mild gas and bloating may occur. Rare cases of infection have been reported, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.
* **Contraindications:** Severe immunodeficiency, short gut syndrome, critical illness.
* **Drug Interactions:** Potential interactions with antibiotics and antifungals.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Possibly safe during pregnancy; limited information available for breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** Varies depending on the product; typically 10-100 billion CFUs daily for adults.  Consult a healthcare professional for specific recommendations.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for gastrointestinal tolerance and resolution of symptoms.


## **Popular Combinations**

*L. casei* is often found in combination with other probiotic species in supplements.  The rationale behind these combinations is typically to provide broader support for gut health or to target specific conditions.


## **Precautions**

* Consult with a healthcare professional before starting *L. casei*, especially if pregnant, breastfeeding, immunocompromised, or have underlying health conditions.
* Start with a low dose and gradually increase to minimize potential side effects.
