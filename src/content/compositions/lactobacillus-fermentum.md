## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** *Lactobacillus fermentum* is primarily used as a probiotic to support gastrointestinal health. It may be beneficial in preventing or treating conditions like antibiotic-associated diarrhea, infant diarrhea, and possibly mastitis in breastfeeding women.  Some studies also suggest potential benefits for eczema, hay fever, and high cholesterol.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Probiotic.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  *L. fermentum* exerts its effects by colonizing the gut and modulating the intestinal microbiota. It competes with pathogenic bacteria for resources and adhesion sites, produces antimicrobial substances, and may enhance immune function.

## **Alternate Names**

- *Limosilactobacillus fermentum* (updated scientific name)
- Brand names vary depending on the specific product formulation. Qiara is a brand name specifically containing *Lactobacillus fermentum* CECT5716.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** *L. fermentum* primarily affects the gastrointestinal tract, influencing the balance of gut microbiota, inhibiting the growth of certain pathogens, and potentially modulating immune responses. Certain strains, such as CECT5716, may have specific effects on breast milk composition and reduce the risk of mastitis.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** *L. fermentum* is administered orally.  It colonizes the gut, but its absorption into the systemic circulation is limited. It is primarily eliminated through the feces.  Specific pharmacokinetic parameters (absorption rate, distribution, metabolism, elimination half-life) are not typically measured for probiotics.
- **Mode of Action:**  The mode of action is multifaceted, including competitive exclusion of pathogens, production of antimicrobial substances (e.g., bacteriocins, organic acids), modulation of gut barrier function, and stimulation of immune responses.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Specific receptor interactions, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation by *L. fermentum* have not been extensively characterized.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily eliminated through fecal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 1–3 billion CFU daily, typically divided into multiple doses. Some studies have used higher doses, up to 9 billion CFU/day for specific conditions like mastitis.  Dosage may vary depending on the product formulation and the indication.

#### **Children:** Dosing in children varies considerably.  For example, one study used 750 million CFU daily in children 2-12 years old. Always consult with a healthcare provider for appropriate pediatric dosing.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments are not typically necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are indicated.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are indicated.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in immunocompromised patients due to a theoretical risk of infection.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations have not been established.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific dosage adjustments are routinely recommended based on renal/hepatic function, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
- Mild gastrointestinal discomfort, such as bloating and gas.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
- Systemic infection (extremely rare, primarily in immunocompromised individuals).

### **Long-Term Effects:**
- Long-term effects are generally not observed with probiotic use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
-  Clinically significant ADRs are rare.  Systemic infections are a serious, but very infrequent, ADR.


## **Contraindications**

- **Absolute Contraindications:** Severe acute pancreatitis, immunocompromised states (use with extreme caution).
- **Relative Contraindications:** Patients with damaged heart valves (consult a physician before use, especially prior to dental or surgical procedures).

## **Drug Interactions**

- **Antibiotics:** Antibiotics can reduce the effectiveness of *L. fermentum*. Administer probiotics at least 2 hours before or after antibiotics.
- **Antifungals:** Potential interactions with antifungals like clotrimazole and ketoconazole have been noted.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

*L. fermentum* is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Some formulations, specifically containing *L. fermentum* CECT5716, are marketed for use during pregnancy and lactation.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Modulates gut microbiota, inhibits pathogens, and may enhance immune function.
- **Side Effects:**  Bloating, gas (rarely, systemic infection).
- **Contraindications:** Severe acute pancreatitis; use with caution in immunocompromised states.
- **Drug Interactions:** Antibiotics, antifungals.
