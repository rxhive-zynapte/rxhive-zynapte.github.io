## **Usage**

Lactobacillus sporogenes, also known as Bacillus coagulans, is a spore-forming probiotic bacteria. It is primarily used to treat and prevent diarrhea caused by various factors, such as infections, antibiotic use, travel, and chemotherapy.  It also shows potential benefits in managing digestive disorders, vaginal infections, and lipid disorders.  It is classified as a probiotic. Its mechanism of action involves restoring the balance of intestinal microflora, inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria, and promoting a healthy gut environment.  While frequently referred to as Lactobacillus, it is now classified as *Weizmannia coagulans*. This spore-forming characteristic distinguishes it from *Lactobacillus* species.  It should not be confused with Lactobacillus acidophilus.

## **Alternate Names**

* Bacillus coagulans
* Weizmannia coagulans
* Spore-forming Lactobacillus

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** *Lactobacillus sporogenes* exerts its effects by competing with pathogenic bacteria for nutrients and adhesion sites in the gut. It also produces lactic acid, which lowers the pH of the intestinal environment, creating an unfavorable environment for the growth of many harmful bacteria.  It also enhances the host's immune response in the gut.


**Pharmacokinetics:** The spores of *L. sporogenes* are resistant to gastric acid and bile, allowing them to survive transit through the stomach and reach the intestines where they germinate.  The bacteria themselves are transient, meaning they do not permanently colonize the gut.  Elimination is primarily through fecal excretion.


**Mode of Action:**  The main mechanism of action involves modifying the gut microbiota, promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria, and inhibiting the growth of pathogens.  It produces lactic acid, thereby lowering the pH and creating an environment that is unfavorable to the growth of many pathogenic bacteria.


**Receptor binding, Enzyme Inhibition, Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Specific information regarding receptor interactions, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation by *L. sporogenes* is not readily available.


**Elimination Pathways:**  Elimination occurs primarily through the feces.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
* General health: 1â€“3 capsules or 10-20 billion CFUs per day, divided into multiple doses, taken between meals.
* Concurrently with antibiotics: 1 capsule twice daily, taken 2 hours before or after the antibiotic dose, continuing for several days post-antibiotic therapy.
* Diarrhea: 1-10 billion CFUs per day, in divided doses, or 8 ounces of yogurt twice daily, at least 2 hours after antibiotic administration.

#### **Children:**
* One-quarter of the adult dose for children up to 6 years.
* One-half of the adult dose for children 6 to 12 years.
* Full adult dose for teenagers.

#### **Special Cases:**  Specific dosage guidelines for the elderly and patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction aren't universally standardized.  General practice favors initiating therapy at the lower end of the dosage spectrum and adjusting as needed while closely monitoring patient response and tolerance.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for *Lactobacillus sporogenes* in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not clearly established.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
Dosage adjustments may be necessary in some cases and should be determined by a healthcare professional based on the individual patient's needs and condition.


## **Side Effects**
