  - q: >-
      Is lactose intolerance the same as a milk allergy?**


      **A:** No. Lactose intolerance is a digestive issue related to the
      inability to digest lactose. A milk allergy is an immune reaction to milk
      protein.

## **Usage**

Lactose is primarily used in the pharmaceutical industry as an excipient in tablet and capsule formulations. It adds bulk and improves the compressibility of the medication. Lactose is also present in some infant formulas and nutritional supplements.  It is not classified as a drug itself and has no pharmacological classification. The human digestive system breaks down lactose into glucose and galactose for energy production.

## **Alternate Names**

Milk sugar

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Lactose itself doesn't have pharmacological effects on the body. However, in individuals lacking the enzyme lactase, undigested lactose can cause gastrointestinal discomfort.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Lactose is broken down by the enzyme lactase in the small intestine. The resulting glucose and galactose are absorbed into the bloodstream. If lactase is deficient, lactose is fermented by colonic bacteria, producing gases and short-chain fatty acids.  

**Mode of Action:** Lactose is a disaccharide composed of glucose and galactose linked by a Î²-1,4-glycosidic bond.  Lactase hydrolyzes this bond, releasing the two monosaccharides. Lactose does not bind to receptors, inhibit enzymes, or modulate neurotransmitters in its role as a dietary carbohydrate.

**Elimination:**  When digested normally, the resultant glucose and galactose are used by the body for energy. If not digested, lactose is eliminated through the colon.

## **Dosage**

Lactose is a dietary carbohydrate and not a medication, therefore, standard dosage guidelines do not apply. However, for those with lactose intolerance, managing dietary intake is important. Many with lactose intolerance can tolerate small amounts of lactose (up to 12g, about the amount in a cup of milk) without symptoms, especially if spread throughout the day.

## **Side Effects**

In individuals with lactose intolerance:

### **Common Side Effects**
- Abdominal bloating
- Cramps
- Flatulence
- Diarrhea

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Severe symptoms of lactose intolerance are rare but may include severe abdominal pain and dehydration from diarrhea.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term issues are generally avoided by dietary management of lactose intake.  

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Lactose is not a drug and therefore does not have ADRs.

## **Contraindications**

Congenital lactase deficiency (extremely rare) or galactosemia. Individuals with these conditions must avoid all lactose.


## **Drug Interactions**

Lactose is primarily a dietary carbohydrate.  While it is an ingredient in many medications, clinically significant interactions due to the lactose component are rare.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Lactose is safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Human breast milk naturally contains lactose, even higher than cow's milk. Lactose intolerance in the mother does not affect the lactose content of breast milk.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

Since lactose isn't a drug, this section is not applicable.

## **Popular Combinations**

Not applicable as lactose isn't a drug.

## **Precautions**

General precautions include dietary management for individuals with lactose intolerance. Gradual introduction of lactose-containing foods may help determine tolerance levels. Enzyme supplements (lactase) can be taken with meals to improve digestion.
