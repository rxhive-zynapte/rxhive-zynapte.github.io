## **Usage**

Lansoprazole is prescribed for the treatment of various gastrointestinal conditions caused by excessive gastric acid secretion. These include:

*   Duodenal and gastric ulcers
*   Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
*   Erosive esophagitis
*   Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (a condition characterized by excessive stomach acid production)
*   *Helicobacter pylori* eradication (in combination with antibiotics)
*   NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)-associated gastric ulcers.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI)

**Mechanism of Action:** Lansoprazole irreversibly inhibits the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system (proton pump) in gastric parietal cells. This action effectively blocks the final step of gastric acid production, reducing both basal and stimulated acid secretion.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Lansoprazole" is the generic name internationally recognized, slight spelling variations may exist.  Brand names include Prevacid, Zoton FasTab, and Inhibitol.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Lansoprazole suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the proton pump, leading to a significant reduction in both basal and stimulated gastric acid levels.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:**  Lansoprazole is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1.5 to 2.2 hours.  The presence of food reduces the bioavailability of the drug.
*   **Metabolism:**  Lansoprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by the CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 enzymes, to inactive metabolites.
*   **Elimination:**  The metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine and bile.  The elimination half-life is relatively short, approximately 1.5 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Lansoprazole, a prodrug, is converted to its active form in the acidic environment of the parietal cell canaliculi.  The active form then binds to the proton pump, irreversibly inhibiting its activity.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**  Lansoprazole's primary mechanism is the irreversible inhibition of the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme (proton pump).

**Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily hepatic metabolism via CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, followed by renal and biliary excretion of metabolites.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   15-30 mg orally once daily for conditions like GERD, duodenal ulcers, and gastric ulcers.
*   60 mg orally once daily for Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, adjustable up to 180 mg/day in divided doses if needed.

#### **Children:**

Dosage and usage must be determined by a doctor, depending on age, weight and medical condition. Doses generally start at 15mg/day for children under 30kg, and 30mg/day for those above 30kg or age 12 or older.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment may be necessary due to age-related decline in renal and hepatic function. Close monitoring recommended.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is typically required.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  A dose reduction (e.g. 50%) is recommended for moderate to severe hepatic impairment. 
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Dose adjustments may be required based on the specific comorbidity and its potential impact on drug metabolism or clearance. Careful clinical evaluation is crucial.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Lansoprazole's role in these settings is primarily for stress ulcer prophylaxis:

*   **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:** 30 mg IV once daily is common practice, with dose adjustments as per patient requirements.
*   **Emergency Situations:** IV administration may be preferred for rapid onset of action in acute situations. The dosage will depend on the specific situation and is at the physician's discretion.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on individual patient factors such as hepatic impairment, age, and concomitant medications. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C19 can influence lansoprazole metabolism and may necessitate dose adjustments.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Diarrhea
*   Constipation
*   Abdominal pain
*   Nausea
*   Headache

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea
*   Fractures (with long-term use)
*   Hypomagnesemia
*   Cutaneous lupus erythematosus
*   Stevens-Johnson syndrome

### **Long-Term Effects:**

*   Vitamin B12 deficiency (with prolonged use)
*   Fundic gland polyps

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), severe skin reactions, drug-induced liver injury, rhabdomyolysis.

## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to lansoprazole or other PPIs.

## **Drug Interactions**

Lansoprazole can interact with several medications, including:

*   **CYP450 substrates:**  Lansoprazole inhibits CYP2C19 and may affect the metabolism of drugs like clopidogrel, warfarin, and phenytoin.
*   **Methotrexate:**  Concomitant use may increase methotrexate levels.
*   **Ketoconazole and Itraconazole:**  Their absorption is reduced when taken with lansoprazole.
*   **Sucralfate:** May decrease lansoprazole absorption. Administer at least 30 minutes apart.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

*   **Pregnancy Safety Category:** B (animal studies haven't demonstrated fetal harm, but human studies are lacking).  Use with caution during pregnancy, considering the benefit-risk ratio.
*   **Breastfeeding:** Small amounts are present in breast milk. Potential effects on nursing infants unknown.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** Irreversible inhibition of the H+/K+ ATPase in gastric parietal cells.
*   **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, headache; rarely: *C. difficile* infection, fractures, hypomagnesemia.
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Clopidogrel, warfarin, methotrexate, ketoconazole, itraconazole.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution in pregnancy; unknown effects on infants during breastfeeding.
*   **Dosage:** Adults: 15-30 mg/day for most conditions; 60-180 mg/day for Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
