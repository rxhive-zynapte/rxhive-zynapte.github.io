## **Usage**

- Ledipasvir is prescribed in combination with sofosbuvir for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6 infections. It is sometimes used in combination with ribavirin.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antiviral (direct-acting antiviral agent, or DAA) specifically, an HCV NS5A inhibitor.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Ledipasvir targets and inhibits NS5A, a nonstructural protein essential for HCV replication. By blocking NS5A, ledipasvir disrupts the virus's life cycle and prevents it from multiplying.  It is often used in combination with other DAAs like sofosbuvir, which targets a different part of the HCV life cycle, for a more effective treatment.

## **Alternate Names**

- Ledipasvir is primarily known by its generic name.
- **Brand Names:**  Harvoni (in combination with sofosbuvir)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ledipasvir exerts its antiviral effect by binding to NS5A, a protein crucial for HCV replication.  This binding inhibits both RNA replication and virion assembly, effectively reducing the viral load in the patient's body.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - **Absorption:** Ledipasvir is absorbed orally and reaches peak plasma concentrations within 4-4.5 hours when taken with sofosbuvir.  Food can increase absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily undergoes hepatic metabolism, likely involving oxidative pathways though specific enzymes haven't been fully identified. It's a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transporters but doesn't significantly interact with CYP450 enzymes.
    - **Elimination:**  Primarily eliminated through the feces (about 86%), with only a small amount excreted in urine (around 1%).
- **Mode of Action:** Ledipasvir specifically binds to domain I of the NS5A protein, disrupting the necessary conformational changes for viral replication and assembly. This specific targeting of NS5A inhibits viral production, leading to a reduced viral load.  In particular, it seems to prevent NS5A hyperphosphorylation.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**  Ledipasvir acts as an inhibitor of NS5A, not a receptor binder.  It doesn't seem to have significant direct effects on major CYP450 enzymes, though it does inhibit P-gp and BCRP which can have significant implications for drug interactions. This inhibition can result in an increased plasma concentration of drugs that are substrates for these transporters, necessitating careful monitoring for toxicity.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- One tablet of Harvoni (90 mg ledipasvir/400 mg sofosbuvir) orally once daily, with or without food. Treatment duration is typically 12 weeks but can be extended to 24 weeks in certain cases (e.g., patients with cirrhosis, previous treatment experience).

#### **Children:**

- **3 years and older weighing at least 35 kg:** One tablet of Harvoni (90 mg ledipasvir/400 mg sofosbuvir) once a day.
- **3 years and older weighing 17 kg to less than 35 kg:**  One tablet containing 45 mg ledipasvir/200 mg sofosbuvir or two packets of pellets with the same dose once a day.
- **3 years and older weighing less than 17 kg:** One packet of pellets containing 33.75 mg ledipasvir/150 mg sofosbuvir once a day.
- Treatment duration is typically 12 to 24 weeks.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are required based on age. However, closely monitor patients for potential side effects or drug interactions, as they might be more susceptible due to age-related changes in physiology.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary for mild to severe renal impairment, including those on dialysis. However, the safety of Ledipasvir has not been thoroughly studied in patients with both decompensated cirrhosis and severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No dose adjustment is necessary for mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment. 
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor patients with diabetes closely for hypoglycemia.  For patients with a history of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection, monitor for HBV reactivation.  For patients taking vitamin K antagonists, monitor INR closely.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir is specifically indicated for treating chronic HCV infection and isn't typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU care for reasons other than managing an underlying HCV infection. In emergency situations (e.g., cardiac arrest, status epilepticus), Ledipasvir's antiviral effects would not be relevant.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Refer to "Special Cases" in the previous sections. Dose adjustment of ribavirin might be necessary if used in combination with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, particularly based on hemoglobin levels.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Fatigue
- Headache
- Nausea
- Diarrhea
- Difficulty sleeping
- Irritability
- Muscle pain
- Dizziness
- Cough

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Severe allergic reactions (e.g., skin rash, itching/swelling, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
- Reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients with prior HBV infection
- Symptomatic bradycardia (especially in patients also taking amiodarone)
- Signs of liver decompensation (e.g., jaundice, loss of appetite, right-sided upper stomach pain, vomiting, general feeling of unwellness, light-colored stools)


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Data on the long-term side effects of Ledipasvir are still limited.  Monitoring for liver health and potential delayed adverse events is important.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Refer to "Rare but Serious Side Effects". Any ADRs should be promptly reported to relevant pharmacovigilance authorities.


## **Contraindications**

-  Coadministration with strong P-gp inducers like rifampin, rifabutin, St. John's wort, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and tipranavir/ritonavir is contraindicated as they substantially decrease ledipasvir and sofosbuvir plasma concentrations and reduce therapeutic efficacy.
- Hypersensitivity to Ledipasvir or Sofosbuvir.


## **Drug Interactions**

-  **Strong P-gp inducers:** Rifampin, Rifabutin, St. John's Wort, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tipranavir/ritonavir (Contraindicated - see Contraindications section.)
- **Moderate to Serious Interactions:** Amiodarone (can cause bradycardia), certain HIV medications, antacids (containing aluminum or magnesium hydroxide – take 4 hours before or after Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir).
- **Other Interactions:** Many other drug interactions exist. Refer to a comprehensive drug interaction database before co-prescribing.
- **CYP450 Interactions:** Ledipasvir is not a significant CYP450 inhibitor or inducer, though its inhibition of P-gp and BCRP can affect drugs that are transported by these proteins.
- **Food and Lifestyle Factors:**  No specific restrictions other than the potential interaction with grapefruit juice (due to CYP3A4 interaction with sofosbuvir).  Alcohol should be limited due to its potential impact on liver health.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  When used with Ribavirin:  Contraindicated in pregnancy and in males whose partners are pregnant.  When used alone:  Benefit should outweigh the risk to the fetus.
- **Fetal Risks/Teratogenicity:**  Ribavirin is teratogenic.  Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir combination without ribavirin is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly necessary.  
- **Breastfeeding:**  Ledipasvir levels in breast milk are expected to be low. While some sources suggest it may be acceptable to breastfeed when using ledipasvir alone or with sofosbuvir, it is generally recommended against when used with ribavirin.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
