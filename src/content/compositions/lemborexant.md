## **Usage**

- Lemborexant is prescribed for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance in adults.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Hypnotic; Orexin Receptor Antagonist.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Lemborexant acts by blocking the binding of orexin neuropeptides (orexin A and orexin B) to their receptors (OX1R and OX2R), thereby inhibiting the wake-promoting effects of the orexin system.

## **Alternate Names**

- International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Lemborexant
- **Brand Name:** Dayvigo

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Lemborexant reduces sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep) and improves sleep maintenance (the ability to stay asleep).  It achieves this by suppressing neuronal activity in the wake-promoting orexin system.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Lemborexant is readily absorbed after oral administration, with a time to peak concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) of approximately 1 to 3 hours. Food may delay absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by the liver, mainly by CYP3A enzymes (CYP3A4 and CYP3A5).
    - **Elimination:** Excreted primarily in feces, with a smaller portion eliminated in urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 17 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Lemborexant competitively binds to both orexin receptors, OX1R and OX2R, exhibiting higher affinity for OX2R. By blocking orexin signaling, it dampens the activity of the orexin system, which plays a crucial role in promoting wakefulness.
- **Receptor Binding:** Dual orexin receptor antagonist (OX1R and OX2R).
- **Elimination Pathways:** Hepatic metabolism (primarily CYP3A), followed by fecal and urinary excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: 5 mg orally once daily, immediately before bedtime, with at least 7 hours remaining before the planned time of awakening.
- Dosage may be increased to 10 mg once daily based on clinical response and tolerability.
- Maximum dose: 10 mg once daily.

#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients. Use is not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients (â‰¥65 years):**  Start with 5 mg.  Caution should be exercised when increasing to 10 mg due to increased risk of somnolence and falls.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary. However, those with severe renal impairment may have increased exposure and should be monitored for somnolence.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
    - Mild hepatic impairment: No dose adjustment needed, but monitor for somnolence.
    - Moderate hepatic impairment: Maximum dose is 5 mg once daily.
    - Severe hepatic impairment: Lemborexant is not recommended.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with sleep apnea, COPD, or depression. Consider lower doses for patients taking concomitant CYP3A inhibitors.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Lemborexant is specifically indicated for insomnia. It is not currently recommended or routinely used for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Such uses would be off-label and require careful consideration of risks and benefits.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- **CYP3A Inhibitors:**
    - Strong or moderate inhibitors: Avoid concomitant use.
    - Weak inhibitors: Maximum dose of lemborexant is 5 mg.
- **CYP3A Inducers:**
    - Strong or moderate inducers: Avoid concomitant use.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Somnolence/drowsiness
- Fatigue
- Headache
- Vivid/unusual dreams or nightmares

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Sleep paralysis
- Complex sleep behaviors (sleepwalking, sleep-driving, preparing/eating food while not fully awake)
- Suicidal ideation/worsening of depression
- Hallucinations
- Cataplexy-like symptoms
- Angioedema

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Potential for dependence, although this risk appears lower compared to some other hypnotics.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Angioedema


## **Contraindications**

- Narcolepsy
- Hypersensitivity to lemborexant

## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP3A Inhibitors:**  Concomitant use can significantly increase lemborexant plasma concentrations.
- **CYP3A Inducers:**  Concomitant use can significantly decrease lemborexant plasma concentrations, potentially reducing efficacy.
- **CNS Depressants (e.g., alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines, antihistamines):**  Additive CNS depression may occur.
- **Other Medications:** Consult a drug interaction checker for a comprehensive list.
- **Food:**  Food can delay the absorption of lemborexant.
- **Alcohol:** Avoid concurrent use due to additive CNS depressant effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Limited data are available. Animal studies suggest potential risks at high doses.  Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Lemborexant is present in breast milk at low levels. Monitor infants for excessive sedation.  Consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding alongside the mother's clinical need for the medication.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Dual orexin receptor antagonist (OX1R and OX2R), inhibiting wake promotion.
- **Side Effects:** Somnolence, fatigue, headache, unusual dreams, sleep paralysis (rare), complex sleep behaviors (rare).
- **Contraindications:** Narcolepsy, hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A inhibitors/inducers, CNS depressants.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Limited data, use with caution.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 5-10 mg orally once daily at bedtime; elderly: start with 5 mg.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Observe for excessive daytime sleepiness, complex sleep behaviors, and mood changes.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Lemborexant is typically used as monotherapy for insomnia.  Combinations with other sleep medications are generally not recommended due to increased risk of adverse effects.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess for history of depression, substance abuse, and comorbid medical conditions.
- **Specific Populations:**  See Dosage section for considerations related to pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, children, and elderly patients.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Advise patients to avoid alcohol and to exercise caution when driving or operating machinery the day after taking lemborexant due to potential next-day impairment.
