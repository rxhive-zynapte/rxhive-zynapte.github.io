## **Usage**

Lenalidomide is prescribed for the treatment of several hematological malignancies:

* **Multiple Myeloma (MM):**  In combination with dexamethasone or other drugs for newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory MM. Also used as maintenance therapy after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT).
* **Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS):**  Specifically for patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality.
* **Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL):** In patients whose disease has relapsed or progressed after two prior therapies, one of which included bortezomib.
* **Follicular Lymphoma (FL) and Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL):** In combination with rituximab for previously treated FL and MZL.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Immunomodulatory agent, antineoplastic agent.

**Mechanism of Action:** Lenalidomide has multiple mechanisms of action, including direct cytotoxic effects on tumor cells, immunomodulatory effects (enhancing T-cell and natural killer cell activity), anti-angiogenic effects (inhibiting blood vessel formation), and altering cytokine production.

## **Alternate Names**

International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Lenalidomide

**Brand Names:** Revlimid

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Lenalidomide's effects are mediated through multiple mechanisms, primarily by binding to cereblon, a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This interaction leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of two transcription factors, Ikaros (IKZF1) and Aiolos (IKZF3), which are essential for the survival of myeloma cells.  It also enhances T-cell and NK cell activity against myeloma cells, inhibits angiogenesis, and modulates cytokine production.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:** Well-absorbed orally. Food may slightly delay but does not significantly affect overall absorption.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by CYP enzymes, predominantly CYP1A2, with minor contributions from CYP2J2 and CYP3A4.  A small amount is also metabolized by hydrolysis.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated renally as unchanged drug and metabolites.  Half-life is approximately 40 hours.

**Mode of action:** Lenalidomide binds to cereblon, leading to targeted ubiquitination and degradation of specific proteins within myeloma cells (IKZF1, IKZF3), leading to apoptosis. It also affects immune cell function and inhibits angiogenesis.

**Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly renal excretion of both unchanged drug and metabolites.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Multiple Myeloma (Newly diagnosed, ineligible for auto-HSCT):** 25 mg orally once daily on days 1-21 of repeated 28-day cycles in combination with dexamethasone.
* **Multiple Myeloma (Maintenance after auto-HSCT):** 10 mg orally once daily continuously (days 1-28 of repeated 28-day cycles).  May increase to 15 mg daily after 3 cycles if tolerated.
* **MDS (del 5q):** 10 mg orally once daily on days 1-21 of repeated 28-day cycles.
* **MCL (Relapsed/Refractory):** 25 mg orally once daily on days 1-21 of repeated 28-day cycles.
* **FL and MZL (Previously treated):** 20 mg orally once daily on days 1-21 of repeated 28-day cycles for up to 12 cycles in combination with rituximab.

#### **Children:**  Not recommended. Safety and efficacy not established.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments of dexamethasone may be necessary. Close monitoring recommended.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are required based on creatinine clearance (CrCl).  See specific guidelines based on indication.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments are routinely recommended, but caution is advised.  Close monitoring is necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Considerations should be given for patients with pre-existing conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and history of thromboembolic events.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Lenalidomide is not typically used in the context of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary based on renal function, hematologic toxicity (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), and other adverse effects. Detailed dose reduction guidelines are available in prescribing information and should be followed.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, rash, pruritus, muscle cramps, peripheral neuropathy, and infections.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Tumor lysis syndrome, severe allergic reactions (angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), thromboembolic events (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism), second primary malignancies (e.g., AML, MDS).

### **Long-Term Effects**

Risk of second primary malignancies, peripheral neuropathy.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Tumor lysis syndrome, severe allergic reactions, thromboembolic events, and severe myelosuppression.
