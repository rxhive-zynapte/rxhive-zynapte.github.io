## **Usage**

Lenvatinib is prescribed for the treatment of various cancers, including:

*   **Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC):**  Specifically, locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory DTC.
*   **Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC):**  In combination with everolimus, following one prior anti-angiogenic therapy. It is also used as a monotherapy.
*   **Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC):** As a first-line treatment.
*   **Advanced Endometrial Carcinoma:** In combination with pembrolizumab, for patients whose disease has progressed following prior systemic therapy and who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation.  This applies to  cases that are not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR).

**Pharmacological Classification:** Kinase inhibitor, specifically a multi-kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1-3), fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR1-4), platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), RET, and KIT.

**Mechanism of Action:** Lenvatinib inhibits the activity of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) involved in tumor angiogenesis and growth. By blocking these RTKs, lenvatinib reduces tumor vascularization and slows tumor growth and proliferation.



## **Alternate Names**

Generic Name: Lenvatinib

Brand Names: Lenvima, Kisplyx



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Lenvatinib exerts its anti-tumor effects by inhibiting multiple RTKs. This inhibition leads to a reduction in angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels), thereby limiting the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the tumor.  It also disrupts signaling pathways crucial for tumor cell growth and proliferation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Lenvatinib is orally administered and reaches peak plasma concentrations within 1 to 4 hours. Food does not significantly affect absorption.
*   **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4.
*   **Elimination:** Excreted mainly through the feces (approximately two-thirds), with the remainder eliminated in the urine. The elimination half-life is around 28 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Lenvatinib competitively binds to the ATP-binding pockets of its target RTKs, preventing their activation and downstream signaling.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Lenvatinib inhibits the kinase activity of VEGFR1-3, FGFR1-4, PDGFRα, RET, and KIT.

**Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly hepatic metabolism (CYP3A4) followed by fecal excretion.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   **DTC:** 24 mg orally once daily.
*   **RCC (with everolimus):** 18 mg orally once daily with everolimus 5 mg orally once daily.
*   **RCC (monotherapy):** 24 mg orally once daily.
*   **HCC:**  Weight-based dosing: <60 kg: 8 mg orally daily; ≥60 kg: 12 mg orally daily.
*   **Endometrial Carcinoma (with pembrolizumab):** 20 mg orally once daily with pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks.

#### **Children:** The safety and efficacy of lenvatinib in pediatric patients have not been established. Off-label use has been reported in some cases, but no standardized dosing guidelines exist.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, but caution is advised due to potential increased sensitivity to adverse effects, especially in patients 75 years or older. Close monitoring is recommended.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment is required for severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min): DTC: 14 mg orally daily; RCC and Endometrial Carcinoma: 10 mg orally daily.  No adjustment needed for mild or moderate impairment.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** For severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C): DTC: 14 mg orally daily; RCC and Endometrial Carcinoma: 10 mg orally daily. No adjustment needed for mild or moderate impairment.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Careful consideration is required for patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or other relevant comorbidities.  Close monitoring is essential.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Lenvatinib's clinical use is primarily focused on the cancer types listed above. It is not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on individual tolerability and the occurrence of adverse events.  Dose interruptions, reductions, or discontinuation may be necessary. Consult specific guidelines and tables for recommended adjustments for various adverse reactions.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Hypertension, fatigue, diarrhea, decreased appetite, arthralgia/myalgia, decreased weight, abdominal pain, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, proteinuria, dysphonia, hemorrhagic events, hypothyroidism, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, headache, and rash.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Hepatic failure, hepatic encephalopathy, cardiac dysfunction, arterial thromboembolism, gastrointestinal perforation, renal failure, QT interval prolongation, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), fistula formation, and severe bleeding.


### **Long-Term Effects:** Potential long-term effects may include chronic complications related to organ dysfunction, cardiovascular issues, and secondary malignancies.  Regular monitoring is crucial.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Any serious or unexpected adverse reaction requires immediate medical attention.  This includes severe hypertension, cardiac events, thromboembolic events, hemorrhagic events, and organ dysfunction.



## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to lenvatinib or any of its components.
*   Breastfeeding.
*   Pregnancy (unless clearly necessary and after careful consideration of risks and benefits).



## **Drug Interactions**

Lenvatinib interacts with numerous medications, including those metabolized by CYP3A4 (inducers and inhibitors), QT-prolonging drugs, and medications affecting bleeding risk.  Consult a comprehensive drug interaction resource for details.  Some notable interactions include:

*   **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:**  May increase lenvatinib levels.
*   **CYP3A4 Inducers:** May decrease lenvatinib levels.
*   **QT-prolonging Drugs:** Increased risk of arrhythmias.
*   **Anticoagulants/Antiplatelets:** Increased bleeding risk.

Interactions with food (e.g., grapefruit juice) and lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking) are also possible.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

*   **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Lenvatinib is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of fetal harm (embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, teratogenicity).  Effective contraception is essential during treatment and for at least one month after discontinuation.
*   **Breastfeeding:** Lenvatinib is contraindicated during breastfeeding. It is recommended to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment and for at least one week after the last dose.
