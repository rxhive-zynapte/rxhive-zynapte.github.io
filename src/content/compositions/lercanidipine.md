## **Usage**

Lercanidipine is prescribed for the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension (high blood pressure). It belongs to the pharmacological class of calcium channel blockers, specifically dihydropyridines.  Lercanidipine works by blocking the influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) and a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, thus lowering blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

Lercanidipine hydrochloride is the chemical name. Brand names include Zanidip, Lercadip, and Lecalpin.  It may also be available in combination tablets with other antihypertensive medications.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Lercanidipine primarily affects the cardiovascular system by causing vasodilation, reducing peripheral vascular resistance, and lowering blood pressure. It has high vascular selectivity, meaning it preferentially acts on vascular smooth muscle with minimal effect on cardiac contractility or conduction.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Lercanidipine is well-absorbed orally, but its absorption is significantly increased by high-fat meals. Therefore, it's advised to take it at least 15 minutes before breakfast or on an empty stomach.
* **Metabolism:**  Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4 enzymes. This is a crucial consideration for drug interactions.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion; less than 1% is excreted unchanged in the urine.

**Mode of Action:**  Lercanidipine blocks L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells. This inhibits calcium influx, preventing muscle contraction and leading to vasodilation.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Binds to L-type calcium channels, inhibiting their function.  Metabolized by CYP3A4 enzymes.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The initial dose is 10 mg once daily, taken orally at least 15 minutes before breakfast.  The dose may be increased to 20 mg once daily if needed, based on blood pressure response.  The maximum recommended dose is 20 mg per day.

#### **Children:**

Lercanidipine is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age as safety and efficacy have not been established.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No initial dose adjustment is typically required, but special care should be taken when initiating treatment.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution is needed in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.  Dosage increase to 20 mg should be approached cautiously.  Contraindicated in severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min).
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is needed in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  Dosage increase to 20 mg should be considered cautiously.  Contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Dosage adjustments may be needed for patients with certain comorbid conditions (e.g., heart failure).  Consult specialized resources for specific recommendations.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Lercanidipine's primary clinical use is for chronic hypertension management.  It is not typically used in acute settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like cardiac arrest.  Other medications are more suitable for rapid blood pressure control in these scenarios.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on patient response to therapy and may be needed for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  Close monitoring of blood pressure and potential side effects is essential. Genetic polymorphisms affecting CYP3A4 activity may influence drug metabolism and require individualised dosing.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Dizziness
* Flushing
* Peripheral edema (swelling of ankles and feet)
* Palpitations
* Fatigue

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*  Hypotension
* Angina
* Myocardial infarction
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, angioedema)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term use can potentially exacerbate pre-existing cardiovascular conditions if not adequately monitored.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Clinically significant ADRs requiring immediate attention are rare but include severe hypotension, allergic reactions, and signs of myocardial ischemia.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to lercanidipine or other dihydropyridines.
* Severe hepatic impairment.
* Severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min).
* Left ventricular outflow obstruction.
* Untreated congestive heart failure.
* Unstable angina.
* Recent myocardial infarction (within 1 month).
* Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) or cyclosporine.
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding (unless benefits outweigh risks).

## **Drug Interactions**

* **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:**  Increase lercanidipine levels and risk of side effects.
* **CYP3A4 Inducers:** Decrease lercanidipine levels and efficacy.
* **Cyclosporine:** Increases levels of both drugs.
* **Grapefruit Juice:** Increases lercanidipine levels and hypotensive effect.
* **Alcohol:** Can potentiate the hypotensive effect.
* Other antihypertensive medications: Additive hypotensive effects.
* Digoxin, simvastatin, beta-blockers:  Monitor for potential interactions.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Lercanidipine should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks.  It is unknown if lercanidipine is excreted in breast milk.  If use is necessary, discuss alternative medications with the patient.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Calcium channel blocker (dihydropyridine), causes vasodilation.
* **Side Effects:** Headache, dizziness, flushing, peripheral edema, palpitations.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe hepatic/renal impairment, certain cardiovascular conditions, CYP3A4 inhibitor/cyclosporin use.
* **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers, cyclosporine, grapefruit juice, alcohol.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid unless benefits outweigh risks.
* **Dosage:** 10-20 mg once daily.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, heart rate, signs of peripheral edema, liver/kidney function tests if indicated.


## **Popular Combinations**

Lercanidipine can be combined with other antihypertensive agents like beta-blockers (e.g., atenolol), diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide), or ACE inhibitors (e.g., enalapril, captopril) for enhanced blood pressure control when monotherapy is insufficient.

## **Precautions**

* Assess renal and hepatic function before and during treatment, especially in elderly patients.
* Monitor blood pressure regularly.
* Caution patients about potential for dizziness and orthostatic hypotension.
* Advise patients to avoid grapefruit juice and alcohol.
