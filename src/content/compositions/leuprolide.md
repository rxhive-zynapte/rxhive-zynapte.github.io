## **Usage**

Leuprolide is prescribed for various conditions, including:

*   **Prostate Cancer:**  Palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer.
*   **Endometriosis:**  Management of endometriosis symptoms.
*   **Uterine Fibroids:** Preoperative treatment to reduce fibroid size and bleeding.
*   **Central Precocious Puberty (CPP):** Treatment of early onset puberty in children.
*   **Breast Cancer (in premenopausal women):** Adjuvant treatment for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.
*   **Prostate Cancer:** As part of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist.

**Mechanism of Action:** Leuprolide initially stimulates the pituitary gland to release luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).  However, continuous administration leads to downregulation of GnRH receptors, ultimately suppressing the release of LH and FSH. This results in decreased estrogen production in women and decreased testosterone production in men.

## **Alternate Names**

Leuprolide acetate

**Brand Names:** Lupron, Lupron Depot, Lupron Depot-Ped, Eligard, Camcevi, Fensolvi, Viadur.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Leuprolide acts as a GnRH agonist, initially stimulating and subsequently suppressing the release of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) from the pituitary gland.  This leads to a decrease in sex hormones (estrogen in women and testosterone in men).

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:**  Variable depending on the formulation and route of administration. Depot formulations provide sustained release.
*   **Metabolism:** Primarily hepatic and renal enzymatic degradation.
*   **Elimination:**  Excreted mainly through the kidneys, with a small amount in feces. The terminal half-life is approximately 3 hours for immediate-release formulations and longer for depot formulations.

**Mode of Action:** Leuprolide binds to GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland. Initially, this binding stimulates LH and FSH release. However, continuous exposure leads to receptor desensitization and downregulation, ultimately suppressing gonadotropin secretion.

**Receptor Binding:**  GnRH receptor agonist.

**Elimination Pathways:** Renal and hepatic.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   **Prostate Cancer:**  7.5 mg IM monthly, 22.5 mg IM every 3 months, 30 mg IM every 4 months, or 45 mg IM every 6 months. Subcutaneous formulations are also available with similar dosing regimens.
*   **Endometriosis:** 3.75 mg IM monthly or 11.25 mg IM every 3 months.
*   **Uterine Fibroids:** 3.75 mg IM monthly for up to 3 months preoperatively.

#### **Children (CPP):**

*   Dosage is based on body weight and should be individualized.
*   Various IM and subcutaneous formulations are available with different dosing regimens.
*   Monitoring of hormone levels is essential for dosage adjustment.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised. Dose adjustment may be needed in severe renal impairment.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dose adjustment may be needed in severe hepatic impairment.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider individual patient factors, especially cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, seizures, and QT prolongation.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Leuprolide is *not* typically used in the context of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.  It is primarily used for chronic conditions like prostate cancer, endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and central precocious puberty.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments should be considered based on patient response, tolerability, and comorbidities like renal or hepatic dysfunction.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Hot flashes, injection site reactions, fatigue, headache, nausea, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, gynecomastia in men, vaginal dryness in women, mood changes.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Pituitary apoplexy, QT prolongation, seizures, allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), osteoporosis/bone fractures with prolonged use.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Osteoporosis, increased risk of cardiovascular events (in men with prostate cancer).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Anaphylaxis, pituitary apoplexy, QT prolongation, seizures.


## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to leuprolide or other GnRH agonists.
*   Pregnancy and breastfeeding.
*   Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding.

## **Drug Interactions**

Leuprolide can interact with various medications, including drugs that prolong the QT interval, such as certain antiarrhythmics and some antibiotics.  It's important to review a comprehensive drug interaction list before prescribing. Interactions with alcohol, smoking and other lifestyle factors are not prominently described in the information available.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy Safety Category:** X (contraindicated). Leuprolide can cause fetal harm.  A negative pregnancy test should be confirmed before initiating treatment in women of reproductive potential. Effective non-hormonal contraception is required during treatment.

**Breastfeeding:**  Leuprolide is contraindicated during breastfeeding.  It's unknown if it passes into breast milk.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** GnRH agonist, suppresses gonadotropin release, leading to decreased sex hormone production.
*   **Side Effects:** Hot flashes, injection site reactions, fatigue, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, osteoporosis.
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, pregnancy, breastfeeding, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Drugs that prolong QT interval.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
*   **Dosage:** Varies depending on indication and formulation.
*   **Monitoring Parameters:**  Sex hormone levels, PSA levels (in prostate cancer), bone mineral density with long-term use.

## **Popular Combinations**

Leuprolide is sometimes used in combination with an anti-androgen (like bicalutamide) in the treatment of prostate cancer.  Add-back therapy (estrogen/progestin) may be used with leuprolide in women to mitigate side effects like hot flashes and bone loss. Norethindrone acetate can be used to improve anaemia in women with uterine fibroids before fibroid surgery.

## **Precautions**

*   Monitor for disease flare during initial treatment.
*   Monitor bone mineral density in long-term use.
*   Assess for cardiovascular risk factors in men receiving treatment for prostate cancer.
*   Ensure appropriate contraception in women of reproductive potential.
