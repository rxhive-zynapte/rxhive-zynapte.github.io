      is essential.  Patients should be educated about signs of infection and
      instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop such
      symptoms.

## **Usage**

Levamisole is an anthelmintic (anti-parasitic) medication primarily used to treat parasitic worm infections, specifically ascariasis (roundworm infection) and hookworm infections.  It is also used as an immunomodulatory agent and has been used as adjunctive therapy in colon cancer and in some autoimmune conditions like nephrotic syndrome in children.

## **Alternate Names**

* **Generic Name:** Levamisole hydrochloride
* **Brand Name:** Ergamisol (no longer available in the US)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Levamisole acts as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist in nematode nerve ganglia, causing depolarizing neuromuscular paralysis in susceptible worms. This paralysis leads to expulsion of the worms from the intestines through normal peristaltic action, typically within 24 hours of administration.  Additionally, levamisole has immunomodulatory effects in humans, enhancing cellular immune responses, including T-cell activation and proliferation, and potentiating monocyte and macrophage functions like phagocytosis and chemotaxis. It also increases neutrophil mobility, adherence, and chemotaxis.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Levamisole is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1.5 to 2 hours after oral administration.
* **Metabolism:** It is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily to p-hydroxylevamisole and its glucuronide.
* **Elimination:**  Levamisole is excreted mainly in the urine (70% as metabolites and 5% as unchanged drug) and in small amounts in the feces.  It has a plasma half-life of about 4 hours.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Ascariasis:** 150 mg as a single oral dose.
* **Hookworm Infection:** 2.5 mg/kg as a single oral dose, repeated after 7 days in severe cases.
* **Adjunctive therapy in colon cancer:** 50 mg orally every 8 hours for 3 days (starting 7-30 days post-surgery). Maintenance therapy may be given as 3 days of treatment at 2-week intervals for 1 year.

#### **Children:**

* **Ascariasis:** 3 mg/kg as a single oral dose.
* **Hookworm Infection:** 2.5 mg/kg as a single oral dose, repeated after 7 days in severe cases.
* **Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome:** 2–2.5 mg/kg on alternate days for 12–24 months (requires regular monitoring of leukocyte counts).  Maximum dose of 150mg.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are recommended, but caution is advised due to potential age-related decline in hepatic and renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised in patients with severe renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised in patients with hepatic impairment due to the extensive hepatic metabolism of levamisole.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Pre-existing blood disorders and rheumatoid arthritis are contraindications. Caution is also recommended in patients with epilepsy or Sjögren’s syndrome.

* **Ivermectin:** Increased ivermectin bioavailability
* **Albendazole:** Decreased albendazole bioavailability
* **Warfarin:** Potential increased risk of bleeding
* **Anticancer drugs (e.g., doxorubicin, fluorouracil):** Potential increased risk of side effects



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Levamisole is contraindicated during pregnancy due to potential embryotoxic effects. It should be avoided during breastfeeding unless absolutely necessary.  If used during breastfeeding, the infant should be monitored for potential adverse effects. The World Health Organization recommends against breastfeeding during maternal levamisole therapy.
