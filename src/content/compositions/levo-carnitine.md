## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Levo-carnitine is prescribed for the treatment of primary and secondary carnitine deficiency. Primary carnitine deficiency is a genetic disorder affecting the body's ability to utilize carnitine for fatty acid metabolism. Secondary carnitine deficiency can arise from various factors like inherited metabolic disorders, liver or kidney disease, certain medications (e.g., valproic acid), and hemodialysis. It may also be used in specific clinical situations such as during valproic acid overdose or in cases of zidovudine-induced mitochondrial myopathy.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Nutritional supplement, metabolic agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Levo-carnitine facilitates the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, the cellular powerhouses, where they are oxidized to produce energy.  It acts as a carrier molecule, shuttling fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This process is crucial for energy production, particularly in tissues like skeletal and cardiac muscle that rely heavily on fatty acid oxidation.

## **Alternate Names**

- L-carnitine
- Vitamin BT (Note: this form contains D,L-carnitine, which can inhibit levo-carnitine and cause deficiency)
- **Brand Names:** Carnitor

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Levo-carnitine enhances energy production by increasing fatty acid transport into the mitochondria. It may also have antioxidant properties and protect against cellular damage. In patients with carnitine deficiency, supplementation helps restore normal fatty acid metabolism and alleviate symptoms.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Orally administered levo-carnitine has limited bioavailability (around 14-18%). Absorption occurs primarily in the small intestine via a carrier-mediated process.
    - **Metabolism:** Levo-carnitine is not extensively metabolized. A small portion is converted to trimethylamine (TMA) and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) by intestinal bacteria.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion, both as unchanged drug and metabolites.  Small amounts are also excreted in feces. The elimination half-life varies depending on the route of administration (oral vs. intravenous).
- **Mode of Action:** Levo-carnitine binds to long-chain fatty acids, forming acylcarnitine esters. These esters are transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane by carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase. Inside the mitochondria, the fatty acids are released and undergo beta-oxidation, generating energy.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Levo-carnitine is not known to bind to specific receptors or directly inhibit enzymes or modulate neurotransmitters.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Oral:** 1-3 grams/day divided into 2-3 doses, preferably with meals. The starting dose is typically 1 gram/day, increased as needed based on clinical response and tolerance.
- **Intravenous:** 50 mg/kg/day, as a slow intravenous bolus or infusion.  In acute metabolic crisis, a loading dose may be given, followed by the same dose over the next 24 hours.

#### **Children:**

- **Oral:** 50-100 mg/kg/day divided into 2-3 doses, preferably with meals. The maximum dose is generally 3 grams/day.
- **Intravenous:** 50 mg/kg/day as a slow intravenous bolus or infusion.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dose adjustments are routinely recommended. Monitor for potential side effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Chronic oral levo-carnitine is not recommended for patients with severely compromised renal function or those on dialysis due to accumulation of TMA and TMAO metabolites.  Intravenous administration is preferred in hemodialysis patients. Dose adjustments may be necessary based on carnitine levels and clinical condition.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments are routinely recommended. Monitor for potential side effects.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or a history of seizures.  Monitor closely.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use/Emergency Situations:** Dosing is determined based on patient-specific factors, the underlying condition, and the severity of the carnitine deficiency. In acute settings, intravenous administration is often preferred.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dose adjustments may be needed based on patient-specific factors such as renal or hepatic impairment, metabolic disorders, concomitant medications, and clinical response. Therapeutic drug monitoring of plasma carnitine levels can guide dose optimization.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Nausea

- **Anticonvulsants:** Several anticonvulsants may decrease levo-carnitine levels.
- **Other:** Interactions may occur with other medications metabolized by the kidneys or liver.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  B (animal studies have not shown fetal harm, but adequate human studies are lacking). Use only if clearly needed.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Levo-carnitine is present in human milk.  Supplementation in nursing mothers has not been extensively studied. Use with caution if the benefits outweigh the potential risks to the infant from excess carnitine exposure.
