      How should Levodopa be administered in relation to meals?**


      **A:**  Levodopa absorption can be impaired by high-protein meals. It's
      usually advised to take levodopa at least 30 minutes before or one hour
      after a meal. This helps prevent competition for absorption in the small
      intestine. Some formulations may be better tolerated with food to minimize
      gastrointestinal side effects.

      How are patients transitioned from levodopa alone to carbidopa/levodopa?**


      **A:** When switching from levodopa alone to carbidopa/levodopa, levodopa
      is typically discontinued at least 12 hours before initiating the
      combination therapy.  The initial dose of carbidopa/levodopa is generally
      lower than the previous levodopa dose (around 20-25%) and is titrated
      upwards based on the patient's response.

      What is the role of Carbidopa in combination with Levodopa?**


      **A:** Carbidopa inhibits peripheral decarboxylation of levodopa,
      preventing the conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain. This
      reduces side effects associated with peripheral dopamine and allows a
      greater proportion of levodopa to reach the brain, improving efficacy.

      **A:** The maximum recommended dose of levodopa varies depending on the
      formulation and individual patient factors. However, generally, doses
      exceeding 2400 mg/day of levodopa are not typically recommended.  High
      doses are associated with an increased risk of side effects, especially
      dyskinesias.

## **Usage**

- Levodopa is primarily prescribed for **Parkinson's disease**. It's also used for other conditions causing movement problems (extrapyramidal disorders), except those caused by antipsychotic medications.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Dopamine precursor, antiparkinsonian agent.
- **Mechanism of action:** Levodopa is a precursor to dopamine. It crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted to dopamine in the brain, replenishing depleted dopamine levels that are characteristic of Parkinson's disease.

## **Alternate Names**

- L-DOPA
- Levodopum
- Various combinations with Carbidopa (e.g., Sinemet, Parcopa, Rytary, Duopa, Stalevo) and Benserazide (e.g., Madopar, Prolopa).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Levodopa increases dopamine levels in the brain, improving motor control and reducing Parkinsonian symptoms like bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Levodopa is absorbed from the small intestine.  High-protein meals can interfere with its absorption.
    - **Metabolism:**  Much of levodopa is converted to dopamine peripherally (outside the brain), leading to side effects. Carbidopa or benserazide are co-administered to inhibit this peripheral conversion, allowing more levodopa to reach the brain. Levodopa that reaches the brain is decarboxylated to dopamine. COMT inhibitors (like entacapone) may be used to extend levodopa's action by reducing peripheral metabolism.
    - **Elimination:** Metabolites are primarily excreted renally.
- **Mode of action:**  Levodopa is taken up by dopaminergic neurons via active transport and converted to dopamine by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. The newly synthesized dopamine is then stored in vesicles and released into the synaptic cleft, stimulating dopamine receptors.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Initial (Levodopa-naive):** Typically starting with carbidopa/levodopa 25/100 mg three times a day, or 50/200 mg of a controlled-release formulation twice a day. The dosage is titrated upwards based on patient response and tolerability.

#### **Children:**

- Use and dosage must be determined by the physician, and caution is warranted.

#### **Special Cases:**
