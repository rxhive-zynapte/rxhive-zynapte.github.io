  - q: >-
      How does Levodropropizine differ from opioid antitussives like codeine?**

      **A:** Levodropropizine acts peripherally, while codeine acts centrally. 
      This results in fewer CNS side effects, such as sedation and respiratory
      depression, with Levodropropizine.

      patients with renal or hepatic impairment, closer monitoring of drug
      levels and organ function is necessary.

      severe or persistent side effects, discontinuation of the medication and
      consideration of alternative treatment options may be necessary.  For
      severe allergic reactions, immediate medical intervention is required.

## **Usage**

- Levodropropizine is prescribed for the symptomatic treatment of dry, non-productive cough.  It is effective in relieving irritating and exhausting coughs associated with various respiratory conditions like acute and chronic bronchitis.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antitussive (cough suppressant).
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Levodropropizine acts peripherally by reducing the excitability of tracheobronchial receptors, thereby suppressing the cough reflex. It also modulates sensory neuropeptide levels in the respiratory tract. This peripheral action differentiates it from centrally acting opioid antitussives, leading to fewer sedative effects.

## **Alternate Names**

-  (-)-(S)-Dropropizine
- **Brand Names:** Levopront, Levotuss, Reswas, Rapitus, Levare, Dropoleb, Hactosec, Q-Resp.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Levodropropizine primarily affects the peripheral nervous system, specifically reducing the sensitivity of cough receptors in the airways. This leads to a decrease in the frequency and intensity of cough.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with high bioavailability (>75%).
    - **Metabolism:**  Limited information is available regarding hepatic metabolism.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through renal excretion (approximately 35% as unchanged drug) with a half-life of 1-2 hours. Eosinophil levels and body surface area (BSA) are significant factors influencing its pharmacokinetic profile.
- **Mode of Action:**  The drug acts on peripheral C fibers in the airways, inhibiting the cough reflex.  The exact cellular/molecular mechanisms are still under investigation, but it is believed to modulate the levels of sensory neuropeptides in the respiratory tract, reducing cough stimulation. There is no evidence of receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation in the central nervous system.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Renal excretion is the main route, with about 35% excreted unchanged in the urine.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 60 mg, up to three times daily, at intervals of at least 6 hours. The maximum daily dose is 180 mg. Administer between meals.

#### **Children:**

- 2-12 years: 1 mg/kg/dose, up to three times daily, at intervals of at least 6 hours.  Maximum daily dose is 3 mg/kg. Convenient dosages by weight: 10-20 kg: 3 ml (syrup) up to three times a day, 20-30 kg: 5 ml (syrup) up to three times a day.
- <2 years: Contraindicated.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Administer with caution due to potential age-related pharmacokinetic changes. Close monitoring is recommended. Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Use with caution in severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <35 mL/min). Dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance is recommended.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment. Caution is advised in mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction, and dosage adjustment may be required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Administer with caution in patients with severe heart failure, diabetes. Careful monitoring and dosage adjustments are recommended based on the specific condition.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Levodropropizine's use in these specific medical settings hasn't been clinically established and needs further investigation:

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations** (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest)

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose reductions may be necessary based on renal/hepatic function, comorbid conditions, and individual patient responses.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Drowsiness, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dry mouth, abdominal pain/discomfort, heartburn, headache, numbness, and palpitations.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, trouble breathing), altered consciousness, and severe cardiovascular effects.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

-  Limited data are available on the long-term effects of Levodropropizine.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Anaphylaxis (rare).


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to levodropropizine.
- Bronchorrhea (excessive mucus secretion).
- Impaired mucociliary clearance (Kartagener syndrome, ciliary dyskinesia).
- Severe hepatic impairment.
- Pregnancy and lactation.
- Children below 2 years of age.

## **Drug Interactions**

- **CNS Depressants:**  Concomitant use with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or other sedatives can potentiate drowsiness and dizziness.
- Other interactions need further investigation:
    - No clinically significant interactions have been reported with beta-2 agonists, methylxanthines, corticosteroids, antibiotics, mucolytics, antihistamines.
    - Use cautiously when co-administered with medications metabolized by CYP450 enzymes, as potential interactions are not fully elucidated.
    - Interactions with OTC medications, food, and lifestyle factors like grapefruit juice or smoking are not well-established.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** D. Contraindicated in pregnancy. Animal studies have shown a mild delay in weight gain and growth, and levodropropizine crosses the placental barrier.
- **Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.  Levodropropizine is excreted in breast milk.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Peripherally acting antitussive, decreases excitability of tracheobronchial receptors.
- **Side Effects:** Drowsiness, fatigue, dizziness, GI disturbances. Rarely, allergic reactions, altered consciousness.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, bronchorrhea, impaired mucociliary clearance, severe hepatic impairment, pregnancy, breastfeeding, children <2 years.
- **Drug Interactions:** CNS depressants.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 60 mg up to three times daily. Children (2-12 years): 1mg/kg/dose up to three times daily.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Respiratory function, cough frequency/severity,  CNS effects (drowsiness, dizziness), any signs of allergic reactions.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Levodropropizine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate: This combination is used to treat dry cough associated with allergic conditions.  Chlorpheniramine, an antihistamine, addresses allergic symptoms like sneezing and runny nose, while levodropropizine suppresses the cough.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Screen for allergies, assess renal and hepatic function, and evaluate for underlying respiratory conditions before starting treatment. Avoid in patients with productive cough.
- **Specific Populations:**  See section "Dosage - Special Cases."
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid alcohol while taking levodropropizine. Advise patients about potential drowsiness and its impact on driving or operating machinery.
