## **Usage**

- Levomenthol is primarily used topically for symptomatic relief of minor muscle aches, pains, and sprains. It's also used in cough drops and inhalers to relieve throat irritation and nasal congestion.  It can also be used to treat headaches.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Counterirritant, topical analgesic, antipruritic, decongestant.
- **Mechanism of action:** Levomenthol acts on TRPM8 receptors, which are cold-sensing receptors. Stimulation of these receptors creates a cooling sensation that overrides pain signals, providing relief.  In cough drops, it acts as a mild local anesthetic, reducing throat irritation. In nasal inhalers, it helps to open up the airways and relieve congestion.

## **Alternate Names**

- l-Menthol
- (1R,2S,5R)-2-Isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexanol

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Levomenthol primarily activates TRPM8 receptors, leading to a sensation of cold. It also has mild local anesthetic properties.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  When applied topically, levomenthol is absorbed through the skin. Some metabolism occurs in the liver, and elimination is mainly through the kidneys. Following ingestion, levomenthol undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver, followed by urinary excretion.
- **Mode of action:**  Levomenthol binds to and activates TRPM8 receptors, causing depolarization and calcium influx, which in turn trigger cold sensations, overriding the perception of pain. It can also inhibit voltage-gated sodium channels, which may contribute to its anesthetic properties.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Topical: Apply to affected area as needed, typically 2-3 times daily. For inhalers and cough drops, follow product-specific instructions.

#### **Children:**

- Topical use in children under two years is generally not recommended. For older children, follow product-specific instructions or consult a physician.
- Use caution with children under 6 years of age for cough preparations.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically necessary but use with caution due to potential skin thinning.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Use with caution in severe renal impairment as levomenthol is primarily excreted renally.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution in severe hepatic impairment due to potential changes in metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consult a physician for patients with broken or irritated skin, as enhanced absorption can increase the risk of side effects.

### **Clinical Use Cases:**

Levomenthol's use in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations pertains mainly to its topical applications for symptomatic relief from muscle aches, pains, or localized discomfort. The dosages are generally as per the standard adult recommendations.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments should be considered for patients with severe renal or hepatic impairment. Always consult a physician for specific cases.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Skin irritation, burning, or itching at the application site.
