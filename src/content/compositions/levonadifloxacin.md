## **Usage**

Levonadifloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic primarily prescribed for bacterial skin and soft tissue infections, including diabetic foot infections with concurrent bacteremia. It is particularly effective against Methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA).  It is classified as a fluoroquinolone antibiotic and a beta-lactamase inhibitor.

Levonadifloxacin exerts its bactericidal effect by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication, repair, and transcription.  By inhibiting these enzymes, levonadifloxacin disrupts bacterial DNA synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death. As a beta-lactamase inhibitor, it overcomes bacterial resistance mechanisms that involve the production of beta-lactamase enzymes, which inactivate certain antibiotics.

## **Alternate Names**

Levonadifloxacin is also known as (S)-(-)-Nadifloxacin and WCK 771. Brand names include Emrok and Emrok O.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Levonadifloxacin exerts its bactericidal action through the dual inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.  This inhibition disrupts bacterial DNA replication, repair, and transcription, resulting in bacterial cell death.  It exhibits enhanced activity in acidic environments, making it effective against bacteria residing in abscesses or infected tissues.  Its efficacy is also attributed to its ability to circumvent common bacterial resistance mechanisms, such as efflux pumps and beta-lactamase production.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Levonadifloxacin is available in both intravenous and oral formulations. Following administration, it is metabolized primarily to levonadifloxacin sulfate, an inactive metabolite. Levonadifloxacin demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics, meaning that its concentration in the body increases proportionally with the administered dose. It has a half-life that allows for twice-daily dosing. Excretion of levonadifloxacin and its metabolites is primarily through renal and hepatic pathways, with the majority being excreted in the urine. It achieves high concentrations in lung epithelial lining fluid (ELF), which is advantageous in the treatment of respiratory infections.

**Mode of Action:** Levonadifloxacin targets bacterial topoisomerases, specifically DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. It primarily binds to DNA gyrase in *Staphylococcus aureus* and other bacteria.  This binding disrupts the supercoiling and decatenation of bacterial DNA, hindering DNA replication and transcription, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal and fecal elimination. Levonadifloxacin sulfate, the major metabolite, is excreted in both urine and feces.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The recommended dose for adults is 800 mg intravenously every 12 hours or 500-750mg orally once daily for 5-14 days depending on the infection.

#### **Children:**

Levonadifloxacin is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustment is necessary unless renal function is impaired.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be required based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dose adjustments for patients with hepatic impairment are generally not needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Close monitoring of blood glucose is recommended for patients with diabetes. 

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage guidelines should follow standard recommendations for ABSSSI. While data might exist regarding specific clinical situations (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, Emergency Situations), it is not commonly utilized in such contexts and would warrant further investigation before employing it for such conditions.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are necessary based on creatinine clearance for patients with renal impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Constipation, vomiting, cough, nausea, diarrhea, headache, and dizziness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
