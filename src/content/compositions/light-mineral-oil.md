## **Usage**

- Light mineral oil is primarily used as a laxative to treat occasional constipation. It can also be used to soften earwax.  It lubricates the stool and the intestinal walls, facilitating easier passage of bowel movements.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Laxative (lubricant type).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Light mineral oil works by lubricating the stool and the intestinal walls. It is not absorbed by the body and thus increases the water content in the stool by preventing colonic absorption of fecal water, making it softer and easier to pass.

## **Alternate Names**
- Liquid paraffin
- White mineral oil
- Liquid petroleum
- Paraffin oil

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Light mineral oil softens the stool by retaining water and lubricates the intestinal tract.  It has no direct effect on bowel motility.  It acts locally in the intestinal lumen and is not absorbed into the bloodstream.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Light mineral oil is minimally absorbed after oral administration.  It is not metabolized and is excreted unchanged in the feces.
- **Mode of Action:**  Light mineral oil acts physically by coating the stool and the intestinal wall.  There is no chemical interaction with receptors, enzymes, or neurotransmitters.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Excreted unchanged primarily through feces. A tiny amount may be absorbed and eliminated by the liver, though it is not metabolized.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**
#### **Adults:**
- 15-45 mL orally per day, either as a single dose or divided into multiple doses.  The dose can be adjusted based on individual response.

#### **Children:**
- **Children under 6 years:** 5-15 mL/day, divided into doses. Do not exceed 240ml per day.
- **Children 6-12 years:** 5-15 mL per day, single or divided doses.
- **Children over 12 years:**  15-45 mL orally per day, single or divided doses.
- Pediatric safety:  Use with caution in young children and ensure accurate dosing to avoid aspiration. Do not administer to infants.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and adjust as needed based on response and tolerance. Monitor for potential dehydration.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustment is generally needed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustment is generally needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with swallowing difficulties or gastrointestinal disorders.


### **Clinical Use Cases**
Light mineral oil is typically not used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary use is for the relief of occasional constipation.


### **Dosage Adjustments**
Adjustments may be required on an individual basis depending on the patient's response and tolerance.


## **Side Effects**
