## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Linagliptin is prescribed for type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults, along with diet and exercise, to improve glycemic control. It can be used as monotherapy when metformin is not suitable due to intolerance or contraindicated due to renal impairment. It is also used in combination therapy with other antidiabetic medications, including metformin, sulfonylureas, pioglitazone, or insulin, when these, along with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycemic control.  It should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, Antidiabetic agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Linagliptin is a competitive, reversible inhibitor of the enzyme DPP-4.  DPP-4 rapidly inactivates incretin hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). By inhibiting DPP-4, linagliptin increases the levels of these incretin hormones. This leads to increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion and decreased glucagon secretion, thus lowering blood glucose levels.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Linagliptin
- **Brand Names:** Tradjenta, Trajenta, Glyxambi (in combination with empagliflozin), Jentadueto (in combination with metformin), Jentadueto XR (extended-release formulation in combination with metformin).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Linagliptin increases incretin levels, leading to increased glucose-dependent insulin release and reduced glucagon secretion. This results in lower blood glucose levels.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Linagliptin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentration in 1 to 2 hours. Food does not significantly affect absorption.
    - **Metabolism:**  Minimally metabolized; primarily excreted unchanged in the feces. A minor portion is metabolized via CYP3A4.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through biliary excretion with a terminal half-life of approximately 12 hours. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
- **Mode of Action:** Linagliptin selectively and reversibly inhibits DPP-4, leading to increased circulating levels of active incretin hormones, primarily GLP-1 and GIP.  These incretins then bind to their respective receptors on pancreatic beta-cells, enhancing glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon secretion.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Competitive and reversible inhibition of DPP-4.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily biliary/fecal excretion; minimal renal excretion. Less than 5% is excreted unchanged in urine.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 5 mg orally once daily, with or without food.

#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients. Use is not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is necessary based on age, but caution should be exercised in patients over 80 years due to limited clinical experience.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** When Linagliptin is used in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, a lower dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Linagliptin is specifically indicated for the chronic management of type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It is not indicated for acute situations such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

No dosage adjustments are typically necessary based on renal or hepatic function. However, for patients taking linagliptin with a sulfonylurea or insulin, the dose of these medications may need to be reduced to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Nasopharyngitis (common cold symptoms)
- Upper respiratory tract infection
- Muscle pain (myalgia)
- Joint pain (arthralgia)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Pancreatitis (symptoms may include severe abdominal pain that may radiate to the back, nausea, and vomiting)
- Hypersensitivity reactions (including angioedema, anaphylaxis, urticaria, and exfoliative skin conditions)
- Bullous pemphigoid (a severe skin reaction characterized by blisters)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term effects are primarily related to the underlying disease process of diabetes and its complications.  There are no known specific long-term adverse effects uniquely attributable to linagliptin.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Clinically significant ADRs include pancreatitis, severe hypersensitivity reactions, and bullous pemphigoid. These require immediate discontinuation of the drug and appropriate medical intervention.

## **Contraindications**

- History of hypersensitivity reactions to linagliptin.
- Type 1 diabetes mellitus.
- Diabetic ketoacidosis.

## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP3A4 Inducers (e.g., rifampin):**  May reduce the efficacy of linagliptin.  Alternative therapies are recommended.
- **Sulfonylureas or Insulin:** May increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Dosage adjustments of these medications may be necessary.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Category B. Linagliptin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.  While animal studies have not shown harm to the fetus, there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
- **Breastfeeding:**  It is unknown if linagliptin passes into breast milk. Caution should be exercised when administering to nursing women.  An alternate drug may be preferable.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  DPP-4 inhibitor, increases incretin levels, enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion, and reduces glucagon secretion.
- **Side Effects:**  Nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections, myalgia, arthralgia, pancreatitis (rare), hypersensitivity reactions (rare), bullous pemphigoid (rare).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to linagliptin, type 1 diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis.
- **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin), sulfonylureas, insulin.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category B; caution advised during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** 5 mg orally once daily.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, postprandial glucose, renal function (periodically).

## **Popular Combinations**

- **Metformin:**  Linagliptin is frequently combined with metformin for enhanced glycemic control. This combination offers synergistic effects by targeting different aspects of glucose regulation.
- **Empagliflozin (Glyxambi):**  Combines a DPP-4 inhibitor with an SGLT2 inhibitor, offering a dual mechanism to lower blood glucose.

- **General Precautions:** Assess for hypersensitivity to linagliptin, history of pancreatitis, and renal/hepatic function.
- **Specific Populations:**  Use with caution in pregnant or breastfeeding women and patients over 80 years old.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Emphasize the importance of diet and exercise in diabetes management.
