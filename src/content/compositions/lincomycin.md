## **Usage**

Lincomycin is a lincosamide antibiotic prescribed for the treatment of serious bacterial infections caused by susceptible strains of gram-positive aerobic bacteria like *Streptococcus*, *Pneumococcus*, and *Staphylococcus* species, and some anaerobic bacteria.  It is typically reserved for patients allergic to penicillins or when penicillin is deemed inappropriate.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Lincomycin is classified as a lincosamide antibiotic.

**Mechanism of Action:**  Lincomycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit, preventing peptide bond formation and thus halting bacterial growth.


## **Alternate Names**

Lincomycin Hydrochloride

**Brand Names:** Lincocin, L-Mycin


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Lincomycin exerts its bacteriostatic or bactericidal (at high concentrations) effect by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria, preventing peptide bond formation, thus inhibiting protein synthesis. This mechanism disrupts bacterial growth and proliferation, resolving the infection.

**Pharmacokinetics:** 

* **Absorption:**  Well-absorbed orally, reaching peak serum concentrations in approximately 2-4 hours. IM administration leads to faster absorption, with peak levels reached within 1 hour. IV administration results in immediate therapeutic levels.
* **Distribution:**  Distributes widely to most tissues and body fluids, including bone, but limited penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).  It crosses the placental barrier and is present in breast milk.
* **Metabolism:** Minimally metabolized in the liver.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated by the kidneys via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion, with bile excretion also contributing to elimination.  The serum half-life is approximately 5 hours in patients with normal renal function but can be prolonged in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

**Mode of Action:** Lincomycin binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria.  This binding inhibits the transpeptidation reaction in protein synthesis. By specifically targeting bacterial ribosomes, Lincomycin selectively disrupts bacterial protein synthesis without affecting host cell protein production.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion.  Biliary excretion plays a secondary role.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral:** 500 mg every 6-8 hours.
* **IM:** 600 mg every 12-24 hours.
* **IV:** 600 mg - 1 g every 8-12 hours (infused over at least 1 hour).  Maximum daily dose is 8 g.

#### **Children:**

* **Oral:** 30-60 mg/kg/day divided into 3 or 4 doses.
* **IM/IV:** 10-20 mg/kg/day divided into 2 or 3 doses.  

Pediatric safety: Lincomycin injection contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative, which has been associated with a fatal "Gasping Syndrome" in premature infants. Not recommended in neonates unless essential and no alternatives available. Safety and efficacy not established in infants under 1 month old.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments but caution and monitoring recommended due to increased risk of side effects, particularly diarrhea.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Reduce dosage to 25-30% of the usual dose for severe renal impairment. Serum lincomycin levels should be monitored.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution and consider dose reduction, especially in severe hepatic dysfunction. Closely monitor for adverse reactions.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution and monitoring are recommended in patients with gastrointestinal disease, especially colitis, and those with asthma or significant allergies.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical settings should be individualized based on the severity of the infection and patient's condition. The maximum daily dosage is generally 8 g.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be required based on patient factors like renal/hepatic dysfunction, concomitant medications, and clinical response. Monitor serum levels to minimize potential toxicity.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, glossitis, and skin rash.



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

*Pseudomembranous colitis*, *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea (CDAD), severe hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), severe diarrhea, and liver function abnormalities.



### **Long-Term Effects**

With prolonged use, the potential for superinfection (overgrowth of resistant organisms, such as *Candida*) exists.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Serious ADRs like anaphylaxis and severe cutaneous adverse reactions require immediate medical attention.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to lincomycin or clindamycin. Previous history of pseudomembranous colitis or severe colitis related to lincomycin or clindamycin.


## **Drug Interactions**

Lincomycin can interact with neuromuscular blocking agents, kaolin-pectin antidiarrheal medications, erythromycin (antagonistic effect), and opioid analgesics, potentially increasing the risk of respiratory depression or enhancing neuromuscular blockade. Concomitant use with drugs that prolong the QT interval should be avoided. Consult comprehensive drug interaction resources before co-prescribing.




## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy:** Lincomycin crosses the placenta.  While animal studies have not demonstrated teratogenicity, there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.  It should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed.

**Breastfeeding:** Lincomycin is present in breast milk.  Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, the decision to continue/discontinue breastfeeding or the drug should be made considering the importance of the drug to the mother.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea; rarely pseudomembranous colitis, CDAD, hypersensitivity reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to lincomycin or clindamycin.
* **Drug Interactions:** Neuromuscular blocking agents, erythromycin, opioid analgesics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; weigh benefits versus risks.
* **Dosage:** Varies based on route, indication, and patient characteristics; see detailed section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal and liver function, complete blood count (CBC), and observe for signs of superinfection.



## **Popular Combinations**

No popular combinations are specifically recommended.



## **Precautions**

Assess renal and hepatic function before initiating therapy.  Monitor patients closely for signs of CDAD, including diarrhea that is watery or bloody, abdominal pain, and fever. Patients with a history of gastrointestinal disorders, allergies, or asthma should be closely monitored.
