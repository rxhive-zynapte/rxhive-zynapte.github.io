## **Usage**

Liothyronine is primarily prescribed for hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormone. It is also used in the treatment of myxedema coma, simple (nontoxic) goiter, and as an adjunct to radioactive iodine ablation in the management of thyroid cancer.  Its pharmacological classification is a thyroid hormone.

Liothyronine works by providing a synthetic form of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3).  This hormone influences cellular metabolism and protein synthesis, impacting growth and development throughout the body.

## **Alternate Names**

Liothyronine sodium is the chemical name. Brand names include Cytomel and Triostat. It is often simply referred to as T3.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Liothyronine increases the basal metabolic rate, affecting protein synthesis, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and growth and development.  It exerts its effects by binding to thyroid hormone receptors within cells, influencing gene expression.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Liothyronine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 2 to 3 hours.  It is extensively metabolized in the liver and other tissues, primarily through deiodination, and eliminated mainly through the kidneys. The half-life is relatively short, around 24 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Liothyronine enters cells and binds to thyroid hormone receptors in the cell nucleus.  This binding leads to alterations in gene transcription, influencing the production of various proteins involved in metabolism.

**Receptor Binding:** Liothyronine binds to thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), specifically TRα and TRβ, located in the cell nucleus.

**Elimination Pathways:** Liothyronine is primarily eliminated through the kidneys after metabolism in the liver and other tissues via deiodination to inactive metabolites. Some elimination also occurs through biliary excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Hypothyroidism:**  Initial dose: 25 mcg orally once a day. The dose may be increased by 25 mcg every 1 to 2 weeks as needed. The usual maintenance dose is 25-75 mcg daily. Some patients may require up to 100 mcg daily.
* **Myxedema Coma:** Initial dose: 25-50 mcg intravenously. Patients with cardiovascular disease: 10-20 mcg IV. Subsequent doses and route determined by patient response and clinical status.

#### **Children:**

* **Hypothyroidism:** Initial dose: 5 mcg orally once a day. Increase by 5 mcg increments every 3 to 4 days until the desired response is achieved. Maintenance dose is age-dependent: Infants (a few months old) may require 20 mcg daily; 1-3 years: 50 mcg daily; >3 years: 25-75 mcg daily.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Initial dose: 5 mcg once daily, increasing cautiously by 5 mcg increments every 2 weeks based on clinical and laboratory response.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustment may be required based on clinical monitoring and thyroid function tests.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary due to altered metabolism.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is needed for patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or adrenal insufficiency.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Liothyronine is not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU unless specifically indicated for treating underlying hypothyroidism or myxedema coma. In emergency situations like cardiac arrest, the priority is managing the acute cardiac event, not thyroid hormone status.  However, liothyronine may be used in myxedema coma, a life-threatening complication of hypothyroidism, typically in an ICU setting.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications should be based on patient-specific factors such as age, underlying medical conditions (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, renal or hepatic impairment), concomitant medications, and individual response to therapy, as assessed by clinical evaluation and thyroid function tests.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Headache, nervousness, insomnia, increased sweating, heat intolerance, changes in appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, and menstrual changes.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Chest pain, fast/pounding/irregular heartbeat, cardiac arrhythmia, symptoms of hyperthyroidism (anxiety, tremors, heat intolerance).

### **Long-Term Effects**

Osteoporosis with prolonged use, especially in postmenopausal women and those on long-term therapy.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Allergic reactions (e.g., skin rash, itching, hives, angioedema).  Symptoms of thyrotoxicosis resulting from excessive dosage.

## **Contraindications**

Absolute contraindications include hypersensitivity to liothyronine, untreated thyrotoxicosis, and untreated adrenal insufficiency.  Relative contraindications include acute myocardial infarction and angina pectoris without concurrent hypothyroidism. It should not be used for weight loss or to treat infertility unrelated to hypothyroidism.

## **Drug Interactions**

Liothyronine interacts with numerous medications, including anticoagulants (warfarin), insulin and oral hypoglycemics, digoxin, estrogens, tricyclic antidepressants, and medications affecting its absorption (antacids, iron, calcium supplements, bile acid sequestrants). It is also important to consider interactions with CYP450 enzyme inducers and inhibitors.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Liothyronine crosses the placenta, though in limited amounts. Although considered generally safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding, careful monitoring of thyroid hormone levels is necessary to adjust the dosage as needed. Levothyroxine is generally preferred during pregnancy and lactation due to better placental transfer and more experience regarding fetal and neonatal effects.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Synthetic thyroid hormone replacing T3, impacting metabolism and protein synthesis.
* **Side Effects:**  Headache, nervousness, insomnia, sweating, heat intolerance, weight changes, diarrhea, menstrual irregularities. Serious side effects: chest pain, cardiac arrhythmia, hyperthyroidism symptoms.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, thyrotoxicosis, untreated adrenal insufficiency, acute MI without hypothyroidism.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Anticoagulants, antidiabetics, digoxin, estrogens, tricyclic antidepressants, drugs affecting absorption.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe, but monitoring is essential. Levothyroxine is often preferred.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 25-75 mcg/day for hypothyroidism. Children: dose adjusted by age and response.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** TSH, T3, T4, heart rate, blood pressure, bone density (for long-term use).

## **Popular Combinations**

Liothyronine is sometimes used in combination with levothyroxine (T4) in patients with hypothyroidism who experience persistent symptoms despite adequate levothyroxine monotherapy.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:**  Pre-screening for cardiovascular and other comorbidities, monitoring thyroid function, starting with a low dose and titrating gradually.
* **Specific Populations:** Careful monitoring in pregnant and breastfeeding women, children, and the elderly.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Address underlying lifestyle factors that may contribute to symptoms (diet, stress, sleep).
