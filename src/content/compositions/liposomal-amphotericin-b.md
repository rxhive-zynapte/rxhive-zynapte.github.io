## **Usage**

Liposomal Amphotericin B is prescribed for the treatment of severe systemic fungal infections, including aspergillosis, candidiasis, cryptococcosis, and mucormycosis. It's also used for visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) and as empirical therapy in febrile neutropenia where a fungal infection is suspected.  Its pharmacological classification is antifungal and antiprotozoal.

The mechanism of action involves binding to ergosterol, a key component of fungal cell membranes. This binding disrupts membrane integrity, leading to cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

The most common alternate name is "L-AmB."  A popular brand name under which it is marketed is AmBisome.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Liposomal Amphotericin B targets ergosterol in fungal cell membranes. This leads to increased membrane permeability, ion leakage, and ultimately fungal cell death. It also exhibits some activity against certain protozoa, such as Leishmania.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  The drug is administered intravenously. The liposomal formulation alters the distribution and elimination compared to conventional amphotericin B. It exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics. It's taken up by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), particularly in the liver and spleen, resulting in higher concentrations in these organs. Elimination is primarily through biliary excretion, with a small amount excreted renally. Metabolism is minimal.

**Mode of Action:** The primary mode of action is through binding to ergosterol in fungal cell membranes.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Liposomal Amphotericin B's primary effect is membrane disruption via ergosterol binding. It does not significantly interact with receptors, enzymes, or neurotransmitters in the way that some other drugs do.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily eliminated through biliary excretion, with a small amount excreted renally.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 3-5 mg/kg/day IV infused over 30-60 minutes. For mucormycosis, 5-10 mg/kg/day is recommended, potentially up to 15mg/kg/day as tolerated.  For empirical therapy in febrile neutropenia, 3 mg/kg/day is typical.

#### **Children (over 1 month):** Similar to adult dosing (mg/kg basis). Safety and efficacy in children younger than one month have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments, but close monitoring is recommended.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is typically required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No dose adjustment is typically required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient factors and monitor closely.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing in specific clinical settings generally follows the standard recommendations outlined above. Individualized dosing may be necessary depending on the specific infection and patient factors. Consult infectious diseases specialists for guidance.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**  Dose adjustments might be considered based on patient response, adverse effects, and clinical condition.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:** Fever, chills, rigors, nausea, vomiting, headache, hypotension, infusion-related reactions, electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), and renal impairment.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:** Anaphylaxis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, nephrotoxicity (especially at higher doses), hepatotoxicity, and cardiac arrhythmias.

### **Long-Term Effects:** Renal impairment can occur with prolonged use, especially at higher doses.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Infusion-related reactions, including fever, chills, rigors, hypotension, and anaphylaxis, are clinically significant ADRs requiring immediate intervention.


## **Contraindications**

- Known hypersensitivity to amphotericin B or any component of the formulation.

## **Drug Interactions**

Liposomal Amphotericin B can interact with other nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides, cyclosporine), drugs that can cause hypokalemia (e.g., loop diuretics, corticosteroids), and some antineoplastic agents. Interactions with other antifungals (e.g., azoles) should be monitored closely.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Although considered relatively safe during pregnancy (category B), data is limited. Use only if benefits clearly outweigh risks.  It's unknown if the drug is excreted in breast milk. Use with caution during breastfeeding and consider potential risks to the neonate.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Binds to ergosterol in fungal cell membranes, causing cell death.
- **Side Effects:** Infusion reactions, nephrotoxicity, electrolyte abnormalities.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to amphotericin B.
- **Drug Interactions:** Nephrotoxic drugs, hypokalemia-inducing drugs.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
- **Dosage:** 3-5 mg/kg/day IV; higher doses in certain cases.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, electrolytes (potassium, magnesium), liver function tests, complete blood count, and signs of infusion reactions.

## **Popular Combinations**

Often used as monotherapy. Combination therapy may be considered in certain cases, like cryptococcal meningitis (with flucytosine and fluconazole).

## **Precautions**

Careful monitoring of renal function and electrolyte levels is crucial. Premedication with antipyretics, antihistamines, and/or corticosteroids may be used to reduce infusion-related reactions.
