## **Usage**

Liquid Paraffin is primarily prescribed for the treatment of constipation. It acts as a lubricant laxative, softening the stool and easing its passage through the intestines. It's particularly useful for conditions where straining should be avoided, such as hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or after rectal surgery. It also has topical applications as an emollient to treat dry skin conditions like eczema.  It belongs to the pharmacological class of laxatives, specifically lubricant laxatives.  Liquid paraffin works by coating the stool and the intestinal walls, preventing water absorption from the stool and lubricating its passage.  It does not stimulate bowel movement directly.

## **Alternate Names**

Liquid paraffin is also known as mineral oil, white mineral oil, and paraffinum liquidum. Some brand names include Bell's Liquid Paraffin, Hovid Paraffin Liquid, and various generic formulations.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Liquid paraffin lubricates the intestinal tract and softens stool, thereby facilitating bowel movements. It has no direct effect on bowel motility.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Orally administered liquid paraffin is not absorbed systemically. It passes through the gastrointestinal tract unchanged and is eliminated in the feces.  Topical application results in minimal absorption.

**Mode of Action:** Liquid paraffin acts by creating a physical barrier that prevents water reabsorption from the stool. This results in softer stool, easier passage, and reduced straining during defecation. It does not have any receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation effects. Elimination is primarily through feces, as it is not absorbed systematically.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 15-45 ml per day, typically taken in the evening.  The maximum dose is 45 ml per day.  Duration of treatment should not exceed one week unless directed by a physician.

#### **Children:** 
- **3-12 years:** 0.5-1 ml/kg per day (maximum 30 ml)
- **12-18 years:** 10-30 ml per day.

Pediatric use should be supervised by a physician. Use in children under 3 years is generally not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lowest effective dose and adjust as needed. Monitor for potential complications like aspiration pneumonia.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustment is typically required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustment is typically required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with swallowing difficulties, hiatal hernia, or conditions predisposing to aspiration.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Liquid paraffin is generally not indicated for use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its primary use is in the management of constipation.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are made based on individual response and tolerance.  If there is no response at the initial dose, it can be gradually increased under medical supervision.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Abdominal discomfort or cramping
- Nausea
- Diarrhea
- Anal leakage
- Anal irritation with prolonged use

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Lipoid pneumonia (due to aspiration)
- Allergic reactions (rare)

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Dependence on the laxative with prolonged use
- Malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (with prolonged use)


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe allergic reactions requiring immediate medical attention are rare.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to liquid paraffin
- Intestinal obstruction
- Appendicitis

## **Drug Interactions**

- May interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and some orally administered medications.
- Consult drug interaction databases for specific interactions.
- There are potential interactions with antibiotics (tetracycline), diuretics (furosemide), and steroids (prednisolone).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Consult a physician before using during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  Use is generally avoided unless the benefits outweigh the risks.
