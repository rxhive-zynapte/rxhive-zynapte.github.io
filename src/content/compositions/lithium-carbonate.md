## **Usage**

- Lithium carbonate is primarily prescribed for the treatment of bipolar disorder, including acute manic or mixed episodes and maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. It can also be used to augment antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Mood stabilizer.
- **Mechanism of action:** While the precise mechanism is not fully understood, lithium is thought to modulate neuronal excitability by influencing intracellular signaling pathways involving inositol phosphate metabolism and neurotransmitter systems, particularly dopamine and serotonin.

## **Alternate Names**

- Lithium citrate (liquid formulation)
- **Brand Names:** Eskalith, Lithobid, Priadel, Camcolit, Liskonum, Li-Liquid


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Lithium exerts its therapeutic effect by altering the balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, stabilizing mood swings associated with bipolar disorder. The exact mechanism remains incompletely elucidated, but it appears to involve multiple pathways including:
    - Inhibition of inositol monophosphatase, affecting the recycling of inositol, a key component of second messenger systems.
    - Modulation of neurotransmitter systems, such as serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate, though the precise nature of these interactions is complex.
    - Neuroprotective effects, possibly through modulation of signaling pathways related to apoptosis and oxidative stress.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Absorption: Almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within 1-3 hours for standard formulations and 4-4.5 hours for slow/extended-release formulations.
    - Metabolism: Not metabolized.
    - Elimination: Primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Renal clearance is influenced by factors like sodium intake and hydration status.

- **Mode of action (cellular/molecular):** Lithium influences multiple intracellular signaling pathways, including:
    - Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), implicated in various cellular processes and potentially contributing to its mood-stabilizing and neuroprotective effects.
    - Modulation of intracellular calcium levels and protein kinase C activity.

- **Elimination pathways:** Renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Acute mania: Initially, 900-1800 mg/day of lithium carbonate in divided doses, adjusted based on serum levels and clinical response. Target serum lithium concentration: 0.8-1.2 mEq/L.
- Maintenance: 900-1200 mg/day in divided doses, titrated to maintain serum lithium concentrations of 0.6-1.0 mEq/L.
- Extended-release formulations:  900 mg twice daily or 600 mg three times daily for acute mania and 600-1200 mg/day for maintenance.

#### **Children (7-17 years):**

-  Dosing is individualized based on weight, age, clinical response, and serum levels.
- Initiate with lower doses and titrate upward based on tolerability and efficacy. Target serum lithium concentration is generally similar to adults.
- Children younger than 7 years: Use is generally not recommended.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and titrate cautiously due to age-related changes in renal function and increased sensitivity to lithium.  Serum levels below 1.0 mEq/L may be sufficient.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is necessary based on the degree of impairment. Close monitoring of serum levels is essential.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments are usually required, as lithium is not metabolized by the liver.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration is needed for patients with cardiovascular disease, thyroid disorders, and other conditions that may interact with lithium.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Lithium is not typically indicated for use in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest. Its primary role is in the management of bipolar disorder.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments are based on serum lithium levels, clinical response, and tolerability.
- Renal or hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, and drug interactions can necessitate dosage modifications.
- Regular monitoring of serum lithium levels is crucial, especially during initial titration and when there are changes in patient's clinical status or concurrent medications.


## **Side Effects**
