## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Live freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria are primarily used for the treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), ulcerative colitis, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and pouchitis. They are also used to restore and maintain a healthy gut microbiota.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Probiotics.  Probiotics aren't classified in the same way as typical drugs (e.g., antibiotics).
- **Mechanism of Action:** These probiotics work by colonizing the gut and forming a barrier against harmful bacteria and toxins. They modify the gut microbiota, create an acidic environment unfavorable for pathogen growth, and support a balanced inflammatory response.

## **Alternate Names**

- Live freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria and Bifidobacteria do not have other established international nonproprietary names (INNs).
- **Brand Names:** VSL#3, Florimax, Vivomixx.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Live freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria exert their effects by adhering to the intestinal mucosa, creating a physical barrier against pathogens. They also produce lactic acid, lowering the intestinal pH and inhibiting the growth of certain harmful bacteria.  They help balance the gut microbiota and support gut immune function.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Oral administration is the primary route. The bacteria colonize the gastrointestinal tract, but they aren't absorbed into the bloodstream in significant amounts. Elimination is primarily through the feces. The bacteria do not undergo typical hepatic or renal metabolism.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- The usual recommended dose is 2-4 capsules or sachets per day, or as directed by a physician.  The dose can be adjusted based on the specific product used and the individual's condition.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are typically required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustments are typically required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments are typically required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dose modifications may be necessary depending on the specific condition. Consultation with a physician is recommended.

### **Clinical Use Cases:**
- **Specific clinical use cases and dosages would be determined by the treating physician, based on the individual patient presentation.**

### **Dosage Adjustments:**
- Dose modifications are not typically required for renal/hepatic dysfunction or metabolic disorders. However, dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with compromised immune systems.
