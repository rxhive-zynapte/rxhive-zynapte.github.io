## **Usage**

Liver extract, derived from animal livers, historically served as a source of vitamin B12 for treating pernicious anemia.  While its use for this purpose has been largely replaced by cyanocobalamin injections, it continues to be explored for its potential benefits in various other conditions, although scientific evidence supporting these uses is currently limited. These potential applications include improving liver function, treating chronic liver diseases, preventing liver damage, regenerating liver tissue, addressing allergies, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), enhancing muscle development, improving stamina, strength, and physical endurance, removing chemicals from the body (detoxification), and aiding recovery from chemical addiction or poisoning.

Its traditional pharmacological classification could be considered as a hematinic due to its role in red blood cell formation. However,  it isn't classified under a distinct pharmacological category like antibiotics or analgesics.

The precise mechanism of action in humans is not fully understood. It's thought that vitamin B12, folic acid, and iron components may contribute to some of its purported effects.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no widely recognized alternate names for liver extract itself. However, the specific preparation containing cyanocobalamin for injection may have different names depending on the manufacturer.

Some brand names under which liver extract-based supplements are marketed include "Ecological Formulas" and others.

## **How It Works**

The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of liver extract are not fully elucidated. It is known to contain vitamin B12, folic acid, and iron, which are absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract.  Vitamin B12, in particular, plays a crucial role in red blood cell formation, DNA synthesis, and nerve function.

The mode of action at the cellular and molecular level is not completely characterized. Regarding elimination pathways, iron is primarily stored and regulated by the body, while excess amounts can be slowly excreted. Vitamin B12 can be stored in the liver and is eliminated through biliary excretion and renal filtration. Folic acid is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine. Information about receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation associated with liver extract specifically is unavailable.

## **Dosage**

Due to the lack of robust clinical trials establishing its efficacy and safety for a wide range of conditions beyond its historical use in pernicious anemia, standardized dosage guidelines for liver extract aren't currently available.  Any usage should be under the guidance of a healthcare professional who can determine a suitable approach based on individual patient needs and the specific product formulation.

### **Standard Dosage**

Standard dosing information for liver extract beyond its historical use in pernicious anemia is not well-established due to limited clinical research supporting its efficacy and safety in various conditions.

#### **Adults:**

Historically, for pernicious anemia, dosages varied depending on the severity and individual response. Modern practice utilizes cyanocobalamin directly.

#### **Children:**

Pediatric dosing is not established for liver extract, especially in light of the preference for cyanocobalamin in cases requiring B12 supplementation.

#### **Special Cases:**

Dose adjustments in special populations are not defined due to insufficient research on the safety and efficacy of liver extract in these groups.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Specific dosage recommendations for clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations are not established for liver extract.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modification guidelines based on factors like renal/hepatic dysfunction or metabolic disorders are not defined for liver extract due to the scarcity of relevant studies.

## **Side Effects**

While generally considered safe when ingested as food, some preparations of liver extract come from animals, raising concerns about potential contamination. However, there haven't been reports of diseases in humans attributed to contaminated liver extract.  Some potential side effects may include gastrointestinal issues like constipation, diarrhea, or upset stomach. Allergic reactions are possible, although rare.

### **Common Side Effects**

Common side effects have not been well-documented, but some individuals may experience gastrointestinal discomfort.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Rare adverse effects, such as allergic reactions, have been reported, although their precise incidence is unknown.

### **Long-Term Effects**

The long-term effects of liver extract use are not well-studied due to the lack of comprehensive research on its safety and efficacy for many conditions.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs requiring immediate intervention have not been consistently reported, although allergic reactions may warrant urgent medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

Individuals with hemochromatosis or other conditions involving iron overload should avoid liver extract due to its iron content. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should exercise caution and avoid use due to limited safety data.

## **Drug Interactions**

Data regarding specific drug interactions with liver extract are limited.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnant and breastfeeding women are advised to avoid liver extract due to the lack of reliable information regarding its safety during these periods.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

As current research doesn't comprehensively establish its safety and efficacy for various conditions beyond its historical role, a complete drug profile encompassing standard dosing, monitoring parameters, or common combinations is not yet definable. 


## **Popular Combinations**

Specific combinations of liver extract with other medications are not widely established in current clinical practice.

## **Precautions**

Precautions should include screening for pre-existing conditions like iron overload disorders and allergies. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid using it due to limited safety data.  Furthermore, patients with any pre-existing medical conditions should consult with their physician before taking liver extract.
