## **Usage**

Liver Fraction 2, derived from fresh liver, is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to support liver function and address nutritional deficiencies that may occur in liver disease. It is often included in formulations aimed at improving appetite and facilitating recovery from illness, particularly in cases of general debility, convalescence, chronic diseases, and after prolonged antibiotic therapy.  It may be beneficial in conditions like pernicious anemia due to its vitamin B12 content. While some sources mention its use alongside other medications in treating liver disease, it is generally not considered a primary treatment for specific liver pathologies. There isn't robust scientific evidence to support its use for specific liver diseases like chronic fatigue syndrome or hepatitis C.


Its pharmacological classification can be considered as a nutritional supplement and adjuvant therapy.  The exact mechanism of action in humans is not fully understood but it provides essential nutrients for liver regeneration and function.


## **Alternate Names**

Liver Fraction 2 is also known as Liver Extract or Aqueous Liver Extract. It can be found in various products under different brand names like "Whole Liver Extra Injection" and "Bayer's Tonic". Other names include: Concentré de Foie, Concentré de Foie Néonatal, Desiccated Liver, Desiccated Pork Liver, Extracto de Hígado, Extrait Aqueux de Foie, Extrait de Foie, Extrait de Foie Hydrolysé, Extrait Liquide de Foie, Facteurs Hépatiques, Foie Cru, Foie Desséché, Foie de Porc Desséché, Fractions de Foie, Fractions Hépatiques, Fractions Liquides de Foie, Hydrolysat de Foie, Hydrolyzed Liver Extract, Liquid Liver Extract, Liquid Liver Fractions, Liver, Liver Concentrate, Liver Factors, Liver Fraction II, Liver Fractions, Liver Hydrolysate, Liver Substance, Neonatal Liver Concentrate, Raw Liver, Substance de Foie, Substance Hépatique.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Liver Fraction 2 provides essential nutrients, including vitamin B12, folic acid, and iron, which are crucial for liver cell function and regeneration. Vitamin B12 plays a key role in DNA synthesis, red blood cell formation, and neurological function. Folic acid is important for cell growth and division. Iron is a crucial component of hemoglobin, responsible for oxygen transport.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Absorption, metabolism, and elimination of Liver Fraction 2 components are not specifically detailed in the available resources. However, the individual components are processed by the body through their usual metabolic pathways (iron absorption, vitamin B12 processing, etc).  Elimination pathways for the various nutrients in Liver Fraction 2 would include both renal and hepatic routes, depending on the specific nutrient.

The mode of action at the cellular level involves providing necessary building blocks and cofactors for various metabolic processes within liver cells.  This nutritional support aims to improve liver function, potentially by enhancing cellular repair and regeneration. Specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation are not directly associated with Liver Fraction 2.

## **Dosage**


Dosage information for Liver Fraction 2 derived from fresh liver, as a standalone product, is limited. Existing information primarily pertains to combination products or liver extract in general. 

### **Standard Dosage**

The standard dosage is not clearly defined in available sources. It's typically determined by a physician based on the patient's specific needs and the formulation used.

#### **Adults:**

One source suggests 15ml twice daily for four weeks for a liver tonic containing Liver Fraction 2. Another source mentions a dosage of 4mg of Liver Fraction 2 (derived from 0.1g of fresh liver) in combination with other ingredients. One veterinary product suggests 25-50ml twice daily for animals depending on size. These examples highlight the variability and formulation-specific nature of dosing.


#### **Children:**

Limited specific pediatric dosing guidelines are available.  Due to the potential for toxicity from other ingredients sometimes included in liver extracts, the use in young children requires extreme caution and should only be done when clearly needed under strict medical supervision.

#### **Special Cases:**

Insufficient data exists for dosage adjustments in elderly patients, those with renal or hepatic impairment, or patients with comorbid conditions. Due to iron content, caution is advised in patients with hemochromatosis.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations are not available for Liver Fraction 2 specifically. 

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are not specifically defined but should be individualized based on patient factors, including liver function and other relevant health conditions.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Limited data is available on specific side effects of Liver Fraction 2. Some sources suggest it's generally safe to use.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Rare side effects are not explicitly mentioned in the sources. However, given the potential for contamination in some animal-derived extracts, theoretical risks might include allergic reactions or infections. 

### **Long-Term Effects**

Data regarding the long-term effects is unavailable.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

No specific ADRs related to Liver Fraction 2 are identified.

## **Contraindications**

Contraindications specific to Liver Fraction 2 are limited. Caution is advised in patients with iron overload (hemochromatosis).  In general, allergy to any component of the preparation contraindicates its use.

## **Drug Interactions**

Specific drug interactions for Liver Fraction 2 are not detailed in the provided sources.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of using Liver Fraction 2 during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been adequately established. It is recommended to avoid use during these periods unless specifically advised by a physician. High doses of Vitamin A found in some formulations can have teratogenic effects.
