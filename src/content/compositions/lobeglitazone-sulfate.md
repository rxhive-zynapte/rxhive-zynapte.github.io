## **Usage**

- Lobeglitazone Sulfate is prescribed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults. It is particularly beneficial for patients whose blood sugar levels are inadequately controlled by diet and exercise alone. It can be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antidiabetic medications like metformin or sulfonylureas.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antidiabetic agent, Thiazolidinedione
- **Mechanism of Action:** Lobeglitazone Sulfate is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) agonist. It increases the sensitivity of cells to insulin, primarily in peripheral tissues such as muscles and fat, which enhances glucose uptake and utilization. This action leads to a reduction in blood sugar levels.


## **Alternate Names** 

- Duvie (Korea)
- LOBG (India)
- **Brand Names:**
    - Lobetron
    - Lobg
    - Lobula


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Lobeglitazone Sulfate primarily works by improving insulin sensitivity. By activating PPAR-γ receptors, it modulates gene expression involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, leading to increased glucose uptake and utilization in peripheral tissues and reduced hepatic glucose production.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Following oral administration, Lobeglitazone Sulfate is rapidly and almost completely absorbed, reaching peak plasma levels (Tmax) within 1 to 3 hours. It undergoes extensive metabolism, primarily by CYP3A4, and is eliminated mainly through metabolism with negligible urinary excretion. It has a half-life of 7.8 to 9.8 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Lobeglitazone Sulfate binds to and activates PPAR-γ receptors within fat cells. This activation enhances the binding of insulin at these cells, promoting glucose uptake and utilization.
- **Receptor Binding:** PPAR-γ agonist.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism, with negligible renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 0.5 mg orally once daily.


#### **Children:**

- The safety and efficacy of Lobeglitazone Sulfate have not been established in pediatric patients, therefore, its use is not recommended.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution as elderly patients generally have reduced physiological functions, such as hepatic and renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment is not necessary for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.  However, patients with severe renal impairment should not use Lobeglitazone Sulfate.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or elevated liver enzymes (ALT or AST more than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal). Liver enzyme monitoring is recommended before initiating therapy and regularly thereafter.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with heart failure.  Contraindicated in severe heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV).


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Lobeglitazone Sulfate's indicated use is limited to type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is not indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient response and tolerability. Monitor blood glucose and liver function regularly to adjust the dose accordingly.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Weight gain
- Peripheral edema (swelling)
- Headache
- Nasopharyngitis
- Upper respiratory tract infections


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Liver damage
- Heart failure (worsening of pre-existing heart failure or new onset)
- Pancreatitis
- Bladder cancer
- Increased risk of bone fractures


### **Long-Term Effects**

- Potential for decreased bone mineral density with long-term use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Hepatotoxicity
- Severe allergic reactions



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to Lobeglitazone Sulfate or any of its components
- Type 1 diabetes mellitus
- Diabetic ketoacidosis, diabetic coma, or pre-coma
- Severe heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV)
- Active liver disease
- Severe renal impairment


## **Drug Interactions**

- Lobeglitazone Sulfate is metabolized by CYP3A4, and therefore drugs that induce or inhibit this enzyme can affect its levels.
- Concomitant use with other antidiabetic drugs (e.g., metformin, sulfonylureas) may require dosage adjustment to prevent hypoglycemia.
- Caution is advised with medications that can cause fluid retention (e.g., NSAIDs, corticosteroids) as they may exacerbate edema.
- Consult a comprehensive drug interaction database for a complete list of potential interactions.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Lobeglitazone Sulfate is not recommended for use during pregnancy or breastfeeding as it may cause harm to the fetus or be secreted in breast milk.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** PPAR-γ agonist, increases insulin sensitivity.
- **Side Effects:** Weight gain, edema, headache, liver damage, heart failure.
- **Contraindications:** Type 1 diabetes, heart failure, liver disease, pregnancy.
- **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors, other antidiabetic agents.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Not recommended.
- **Dosage:** 0.5 mg orally once daily.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood glucose, liver function tests, HbA1c.


## **Popular Combinations**

- Metformin
- Sulfonylureas


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Monitor liver function and blood glucose levels regularly.  Assess for signs and symptoms of heart failure.  Bone mineral density monitoring may be considered for long-term use.
- **Specific Populations:** See "Dosage - Special Cases."
- **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Encourage patients to maintain a healthy diet and exercise regularly to optimize glycemic control.
