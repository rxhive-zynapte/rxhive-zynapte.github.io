## **Usage**

- Loperamide is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of acute and chronic diarrhea. It is also used to reduce the volume of discharge from ileostomies.  It's pharmacological classification is an antidiarrheal agent.  Loperamide works by slowing intestinal motility and affecting water and electrolyte movement through the bowel.

## **Alternate Names**

- Loperamide hydrochloride
- Imodium
-  K-Pek II (brand names)



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Loperamide acts on opioid receptors in the intestinal wall, reducing peristalsis (the wave-like muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract). This action allows more time for water and electrolytes to be absorbed from the intestinal contents, resulting in firmer stools and reduced frequency of bowel movements. It does not affect the underlying cause of the diarrhea.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Loperamide is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. After absorption, it undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver, primarily via CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 enzymes. It is highly protein bound. Loperamide and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the feces, with minimal renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Acute Diarrhea:** 4 mg initially, followed by 2 mg after each loose stool.  Do not exceed 16 mg/day for prescription use or 8 mg/day for over-the-counter use.

#### **Children:**

- **2-5 years:** Use liquid formulation. Consult a healthcare professional for appropriate dosing.
- **6-8 years:** 2 mg after the first loose stool, then 1 mg after each subsequent loose stool; not to exceed 4 mg/day.
- **9-11 years:**  2 mg after the first loose stool, then 1 mg after each subsequent loose stool; not to exceed 6 mg/day.
- **12 years and older:** 4 mg after the first loose stool, then 2 mg after each subsequent loose stool; not to exceed 8 mg/day.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is generally required, but caution is advised due to potential for increased sensitivity.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution due to reduced first-pass metabolism. Close monitoring is recommended.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient factors and potential drug interactions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Loperamide is not typically indicated for use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It is primarily used for the symptomatic management of diarrhea.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dosage adjustments may be needed for hepatic impairment, drug interactions, and certain medical conditions. Consult a healthcare professional for guidance.

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Constipation
- Abdominal pain/cramping
- Nausea
- Dizziness
- Drowsiness
- Dry mouth


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Toxic megacolon
- Paralytic ileus
- Cardiac events (rare with recommended doses, associated with misuse/abuse)


### **Long-Term Effects**

- Potential for chronic constipation with prolonged use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Angioedema
- Anaphylaxis
- Stevens-Johnson syndrome
- Toxic epidermal necrolysis


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to loperamide

- Acute dysentery (bloody diarrhea with fever)
- Acute ulcerative colitis
- Bacterial enterocolitis (e.g., *Salmonella*, *Shigella*, *Campylobacter*)
- Pseudomembranous colitis
- Conditions where peristalsis inhibition should be avoided (e.g., ileus, megacolon)

## **Drug Interactions**

- CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, gemfibrozil) can increase loperamide plasma levels.
- P-glycoprotein inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, verapamil) can enhance loperamide absorption.
- Cholestyramine may decrease loperamide absorption.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Pregnancy Safety Category: B (Animal studies have not demonstrated fetal risk, but there are limited human studies). Use during pregnancy only if clearly needed.
- Loperamide is excreted in breast milk in small amounts.  Caution advised during breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Slows intestinal motility by acting on opioid receptors in the gut.
- **Side Effects:** Constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness. Rare: cardiac events (with high doses/misuse).
- **Contraindications:** See above.
- **Drug Interactions:** See above.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category B; use with caution.
- **Dosage:** See above.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Stool frequency and consistency, signs of dehydration or electrolyte imbalance, signs of ADRs.


## **Popular Combinations**

- Loperamide with simethicone for relief of gas-related abdominal discomfort associated with diarrhea.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Assess for dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potential contraindications. Do not exceed recommended dosages. Discontinue if symptoms worsen or persist.
- **Specific Populations:** See above.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Maintain adequate hydration. Avoid alcohol, as it can worsen dehydration.
