## **Usage**

Lorazepam is prescribed for the short-term management of moderate to severe anxiety, insomnia associated with anxiety, and as a pre-operative medication. It's also used in emergency situations like status epilepticus.  It is classified as a benzodiazepine, an anxiolytic, sedative, and anticonvulsant.  Lorazepam enhances the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the central nervous system, resulting in sedative, hypnotic (sleep-inducing), anxiolytic (anti-anxiety), anticonvulsant, and muscle-relaxant properties.

## **Alternate Names** 

The international nonproprietary name (INN) is lorazepam. Brand names include Ativan and Loreev XR.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Lorazepam binds to benzodiazepine receptors on GABA-A receptors in the central nervous system. This binding enhances GABA's inhibitory effects, leading to decreased neuronal excitability.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Lorazepam is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 1-2 hours.  Intramuscular (IM) administration has an onset of action within 15-30 minutes, whereas intravenous (IV) administration has a rapid onset within 1-3 minutes.
* **Metabolism:** Lorazepam is primarily metabolized in the liver through glucuronidation to an inactive metabolite, lorazepam glucuronide. It does not involve the CYP450 enzyme system to a large extent.
* **Elimination:** Lorazepam is mainly excreted through the kidneys as lorazepam glucuronide. It has a half-life of approximately 10-20 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Lorazepam potentiates GABAergic neurotransmission by increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening, leading to hyperpolarization of neurons and reduced neuronal firing.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Anxiety:** 2-6 mg/day orally, divided into 2-3 doses. Initiate therapy with 1-2 mg/day and titrate based on patient response.
* **Insomnia:** 2-4 mg orally as a single dose at bedtime.
* **Pre-operative medication:** 2-4 mg orally the night before or 1-2 hours before the procedure.

#### **Children:**

* **Pre-operative medication (5-11 years):** 0.05 mg/kg (max 2.5 mg) at least one hour before the operation. Children aged 12-17 years may receive 1-4 mg either the night before or at least one hour before the procedure, or both
* **Other indications:** Safety and efficacy not established in children under 12 years for anxiety and under 5 years for surgical procedures. Dosages for other indications should be determined by the physician.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Initial dose of 1-2 mg/day, divided into 2 doses. Titrate cautiously based on response and tolerance.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction may be necessary, especially in severe hepatic dysfunction where it is contraindicated.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful assessment and dose adjustment may be required.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Intubation:** Dosage should be individualized as needed.
* **Surgical Procedures:** 2-4 mg orally the night before or 1-2 hours pre-operatively. IV administration might be used in specific cases.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** Dosage as needed.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** 0.02 to 0.04 mg/kg IV loading dose, followed by 0.01 to 0.1 mg/kg/h continuous infusion, or intermittent doses as needed.
* **Emergency Situations:** 
    * **Status epilepticus:** 4 mg IV at 2 mg/minute. A second dose can be administered if seizures persist.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are required for elderly patients, those with renal/hepatic dysfunction, and those with comorbid conditions. Individualized dosing is crucial. Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism should also be considered.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, ataxia, confusion, amnesia, disinhibition, headache, nausea, vomiting, constipation, blurred vision, changes in libido.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Respiratory depression, allergic reactions, suicidal thoughts, paradoxical reactions (e.g., agitation, aggression), hallucinations.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Cognitive impairment, dependence, withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, severe respiratory depression, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines.
* Acute narrow-angle glaucoma.
* Severe respiratory insufficiency.
* Sleep apnea.
* Myasthenia gravis.
* Severe hepatic impairment.


## **Drug Interactions**

Lorazepam interacts with several medications, including:

* **CNS depressants:** Opioids, alcohol, barbiturates, antihistamines, other benzodiazepines – increased sedation and respiratory depression.
* **CYP450 inhibitors/inducers:**  Although Lorazepam's metabolism does not rely heavily on the CYP450 system, certain interactions may occur.
* **Other:** Valproic acid, antidepressants –  increased lorazepam levels.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  D -  There is positive evidence of human fetal risk. Use only if potential benefit justifies risk to the fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:** Lorazepam is excreted in breast milk.  Monitor infants for drowsiness, poor feeding, and weight gain.  Consider alternative options if possible.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Enhances GABAergic neurotransmission.
* **Side Effects:** Drowsiness, dizziness, ataxia, respiratory depression (rare).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, severe respiratory insufficiency, sleep apnea, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, severe hepatic impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** CNS depressants, some antidepressants.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; potential risks to the fetus and nursing infant.
* **Dosage:** Varies depending on indication and patient factors; individualized dosing is essential.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Respiratory rate, mental status, vital signs.

## **Popular Combinations**

 Lorazepam may be combined with other medications, such as analgesics for pre-operative sedation, depending on the specific clinical scenario. However, due to the increased risk of respiratory depression, combining lorazepam with other CNS depressants is generally avoided.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Evaluate for pre-existing medical conditions, including respiratory, hepatic, and renal impairment.
* **Specific Populations:** Use cautiously in pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, children, and the elderly.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants. Caution patients about operating machinery or driving.
