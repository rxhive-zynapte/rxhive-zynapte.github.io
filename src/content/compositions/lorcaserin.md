## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Lorcaserin was prescribed for chronic weight management in adults with an initial Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 kg/m² or greater (obese), or 27 kg/m² or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes).  It was used as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity. Note: Lorcaserin is no longer available in the US due to an increased risk of cancer observed in clinical trials.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Serotonin 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor agonist.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Lorcaserin selectively activates 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors in the hypothalamus, a region of the brain that regulates appetite. This activation leads to decreased food intake and increased satiety.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:**  No significant variations.
- **Brand Names:** Belviq®, Belviq XR® (withdrawn from the market).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Lorcaserin primarily exerts its weight-loss effects by selectively activating 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors in the hypothalamus, leading to decreased appetite and increased satiety. It has minimal activity at 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors, mitigating the risk of valvular heart disease.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Lorcaserin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations (T<sub>max</sub>) in 1.5-2 hours.
    - **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily through glucuronidation and sulfation. The primary metabolites are inactive on serotonin receptors.
    - **Elimination:**  Mainly excreted in the urine (approximately 92%) with a small amount in feces (approximately 2%). The elimination half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) is around 11 hours.
- **Mode of Action:**  Binds to and activates 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors on anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons located in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. The activation of POMC neurons promotes the release of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), leading to appetite suppression. 
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Lorcaserin acts as a selective agonist at 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors. It is also an inhibitor of CYP2D6.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of metabolites.

## **Dosage**

Lorcaserin is no longer available, thus the following information is for historical purposes only.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 10 mg orally twice daily.
- Maximum dose: 20 mg/day.

#### **Children:**

- Use is not recommended. Safety and efficacy not established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment necessary for those with normal renal function. Dosage adjustments should be based on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    - Mild (CrCl > 50 mL/min): No adjustment required.
    - Moderate (CrCl 30-50 mL/min): Use with caution.
    - Severe (CrCl < 30 mL/min) or ESRD: Not recommended.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
    - Mild to Moderate (Child-Pugh score 5-9): No adjustment required.
    - Severe (Child-Pugh score > 9): Use with caution. Data regarding severe hepatic impairment is limited.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with diabetes, as it may cause hypoglycemia. Monitor blood glucose closely.  Use with caution in patients with a history of depression or other mental health conditions, as lorcaserin may worsen symptoms.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Lorcaserin is not indicated for use in these settings:

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations**

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Discontinue lorcaserin if a patient has not lost at least 5% of baseline body weight by week 12 of therapy.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Headache
- Dizziness
- Fatigue
- Nausea
- Dry mouth
- Constipation
- Upper respiratory tract infection

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Serotonin syndrome
- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome-like reactions
- Valvular heart disease (though less common than with other serotonergic drugs)
- Priapism
- Hypoglycemia (especially in patients with diabetes)
- Worsening of depression or suicidal thoughts
- Psychiatric symptoms (e.g., euphoria, hallucination, dissociation) at higher-than-recommended doses

### **Long-Term Effects:**  The long-term effects are not fully characterized, as studies beyond two years are lacking. Increased incidence of cancer observed in clinical trials.



## **Contraindications**

- Severe hepatic impairment
- Severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease
- Concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs, triptans)
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding



## **Drug Interactions**

- **Serotonergic Drugs:** SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs, triptans, tryptophan, St. John’s wort, and certain other antidepressants can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome.
- **CYP2D6 Inhibitors:** Concomitant use with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors may increase lorcaserin exposure.
- **Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6:** Lorcaserin inhibits CYP2D6 and may increase levels of drugs metabolized by this enzyme (e.g., some antidepressants, antipsychotics, some beta-blockers).
- **Cabergoline and Methylergonovine:** Avoid concomitant use due to shared 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptor activity.
- **Other Medications:** Caution advised with other CNS depressants, antidiabetic medications.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Contraindicated. Animal studies have shown adverse effects on fetal development.
- **Fetal Risks:**  Potential for stillbirths and reduced pup viability at higher doses.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Unknown if lorcaserin is excreted in breast milk. Discontinue breastfeeding or lorcaserin due to potential risk to neonates.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Selective 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor agonist that decreases food intake and increases satiety.
- **Side Effects:** Common: Headache, dizziness, fatigue, nausea. Serious: Serotonin syndrome, valvular heart disease, priapism.
- **Contraindications:** Severe hepatic/renal impairment, concomitant serotonergic drug use, pregnancy.
