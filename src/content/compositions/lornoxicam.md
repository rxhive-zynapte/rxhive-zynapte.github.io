## **Usage**

Lornoxicam is prescribed for short-term relief of mild to moderate acute pain, and for the symptomatic relief of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.  It is pharmacologically classified as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).  Lornoxicam works by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2, which are responsible for producing prostaglandins, key mediators of pain and inflammation. By reducing prostaglandin production, lornoxicam diminishes pain and inflammation.

## **Alternate Names**

While lornoxicam is the generic name, it's marketed under various brand names, including Xefo and Xefocam.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Lornoxicam exerts its analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects primarily through the inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2. This inhibition reduces the synthesis of prostaglandins, which play a crucial role in pain sensation, inflammation, and fever. The balanced inhibition of both COX isoforms contributes to its efficacy. Lornoxicam readily penetrates synovial fluid, further enhancing its effectiveness in joint-related conditions.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Lornoxicam is well-absorbed orally, achieving peak plasma concentration within 1-2 hours after oral administration and approximately 25 minutes after intramuscular injection.  Food can reduce absorption by about 20% and increase the time to peak concentration (Tmax).
* **Metabolism:**  Lornoxicam is primarily metabolized in the liver, mainly by the cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) enzyme, to inactive metabolites. This metabolic pathway can be influenced by drugs that induce or inhibit CYP2C9.
* **Elimination:**  Lornoxicam and its metabolites are eliminated through both renal (urine) and hepatic (feces) routes.  The mean elimination half-life is 3-4 hours.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Pain:** 8-16 mg daily, divided into 2 or 3 doses.  Maximum daily dose: 16 mg for oral administration and 24 mg for parenteral administration.
* **Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis:**  Initial dose: 12 mg daily, divided into 2 or 3 doses. Maintenance dose:  Should not exceed 16 mg daily.

#### **Children:**

Lornoxicam is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustment is needed for elderly patients over 65 years unless there is renal or hepatic impairment.  However, careful monitoring is recommended due to increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  For mild to moderate renal impairment, the maximum daily dose is 12 mg, divided into 2 or 3 doses.  In severe renal impairment (serum creatinine > 700 Î¼mol/l), lornoxicam is contraindicated.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** For moderate hepatic impairment, the maximum daily dose is 12 mg, divided into 2 or 3 doses. In severe hepatic impairment, lornoxicam is contraindicated.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Careful assessment and dose adjustments may be needed for patients with conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and heart failure due to potential drug interactions and increased risk of adverse events.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

While lornoxicam is effective for post-surgical pain, there are no specific dosage guidelines for intubation, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use.  Dosage should be tailored based on individual patient needs and pain assessment.  For emergency situations, intravenous or intramuscular administration might be preferred for rapid pain relief, with a dose of 8 mg once or twice daily, not exceeding 24 mg daily.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modification is necessary for patients with renal and hepatic impairment as detailed above. Metabolic disorders or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism (especially CYP2C9) may necessitate dosage adjustments. Close monitoring of patient response and potential adverse effects is crucial.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Dizziness
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Headache
* Vomiting
* Dyspepsia
* Abdominal pain
* Indigestion


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Perforation of the stomach or intestines
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome
* Toxic epidermal necrolysis
* Cardiovascular thrombotic events (myocardial infarction, stroke)
* Kidney impairment


### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic complications may include gastrointestinal issues, renal dysfunction, and cardiovascular risks with prolonged use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs that necessitate immediate intervention include severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema), gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, cardiovascular events, and serious skin reactions.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to lornoxicam or any of its excipients.
* History of hypersensitivity reactions (asthma, rhinitis, angioedema, urticaria) to other NSAIDs, including aspirin.
* Active or history of recurrent peptic ulcer/hemorrhage.
* Severe hepatic impairment.
* Severe renal impairment.
* Third trimester of pregnancy.
* History of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation related to previous NSAID therapy.


## **Drug Interactions**

Lornoxicam can interact with a variety of medications, including:

* **Anticoagulants:** Increased risk of bleeding when combined with warfarin, heparin, or other anticoagulants.
* **Antihypertensives:**  May reduce the effectiveness of diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
* **Lithium:**  May increase the risk of lithium toxicity.
* **Methotrexate:** Enhanced effects of methotrexate.
* **CYP2C9 Inhibitors/Inducers:**  Drugs that inhibit or induce CYP2C9 can alter the metabolism of lornoxicam, leading to increased or decreased serum levels.  
* **Ciclosporin:**  May increase the risk of nephrotoxicity.

Alcohol consumption should be avoided while taking lornoxicam due to increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and other adverse effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Lornoxicam is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy.  It should be avoided during the first and second trimesters as well, as it may increase the risk of miscarriage and fetal complications.  Lornoxicam should not be used during breastfeeding.
