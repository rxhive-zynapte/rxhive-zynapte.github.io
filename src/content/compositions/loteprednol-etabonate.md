## **Usage**

Loteprednol etabonate is prescribed for the treatment of steroid-responsive inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea, and anterior segment of the globe, such as allergic conjunctivitis, acne rosacea, superficial punctate keratitis, herpes zoster keratitis, iritis, cyclitis, and selected infective conjunctivitides. It is also used to treat postoperative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery and for the short-term treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.  It is a corticosteroid, specifically a "soft" steroid with a unique chemical structure designed to minimize some of the side effects associated with traditional corticosteroids.

It works by inhibiting the inflammatory response to a variety of stimuli by suppressing the migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and reversing capillary permeability. Loteprednol etabonate also inhibits the release of various inflammatory mediators.


## **Alternate Names**

While "Loteprednol etabonate" is the generic name, it is marketed under various brand names, including Lotemax, Alrex, Inveltys, and Eysuvis. There are no widely recognized international or regional variations of the generic name.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Loteprednol etabonate exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the eye. This binding leads to the suppression of inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandins, cytokines, and leukotrienes, thereby reducing inflammation, pain, and other associated symptoms.  

**Pharmacokinetics:** Loteprednol etabonate, when administered as an ophthalmic preparation, demonstrates limited systemic absorption. It is metabolized extensively in the eye to inactive metabolites, primarily PJ-91 and PJ-90. These metabolites are then eliminated, mainly through hepatic excretion. Some may be excreted renally as well.

**Mode of Action:**  Loteprednol etabonate acts by binding to glucocorticoid receptors, which then translocate to the cell nucleus and modulate gene expression. This action results in the decreased production of inflammatory mediators.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Loteprednol etabonate's primary mechanism involves binding to glucocorticoid receptors.  It does not significantly inhibit enzymes or modulate neurotransmitters.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Loteprednol etabonate is primarily metabolized within the eye to inactive carboxylic acid metabolites (PJ-91, PJ-90), which are then eliminated predominantly through hepatic excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Alrex (0.2% suspension):** 1 drop in the affected eye(s) four times daily.
* **Eysuvis (0.25% suspension):** 1-2 drops in each eye four times daily for up to 2 weeks.
* **Lotemax (0.5% suspension, 0.5% ointment, 0.5% gel):** 1-2 drops (suspension/gel) or a Â½-inch ribbon (ointment) in the affected eye(s) four times daily.  During the initial week, the dose may be increased to 1 drop every hour if needed.
* **Inveltys (1% suspension):** 1-2 drops in the affected eye(s) twice daily.
* **Lotemax SM (0.38% gel):** 1 drop in the affected eye(s) three times daily.


#### **Children:**

* **Lotemax (0.5% gel):** 1-2 drops in the affected eye(s) four times daily. Pediatric use is generally limited to post-operative inflammation after cataract surgery in children with a mean age of 3 years. 

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustments are typically necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustments are typically necessary due to limited systemic absorption.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustments are typically necessary as hepatic metabolism pertains to the inactive metabolites.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with glaucoma or a history of herpes simplex keratitis. 

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing for post-operative inflammation following ocular surgery is outlined in the adult and pediatric sections above.  Dosage adjustments may be required based on the type of surgical procedure.  No specific dosage recommendations are available for intubation, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations as loteprednol etabonate is exclusively for ophthalmic use.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with severe inflammation, where more frequent administration may be indicated during the initial phase of treatment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Blurred vision, eye irritation, burning or stinging upon instillation, foreign body sensation, increased eye pressure, headache, dry eye, photophobia.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (e.g., rash, itching, swelling), glaucoma, cataracts, corneal thinning or ulceration, secondary eye infections.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Prolonged use of loteprednol etabonate can increase the risk of developing glaucoma, cataracts, and other eye problems.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, significant increase in intraocular pressure.

## **Contraindications**

Absolute contraindications include hypersensitivity to loteprednol etabonate or any component of the formulation, most viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva (including herpes simplex keratitis, vaccinia, and varicella), mycobacterial infection of the eye, and fungal diseases of ocular structures.


## **Drug Interactions**

No clinically significant drug interactions have been reported with topical ophthalmic loteprednol etabonate due to its minimal systemic absorption. However, concomitant use of other ophthalmic medications should be discussed with a physician.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Category C.  Loteprednol etabonate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.  It is unknown whether topical ophthalmic administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk.  Systemic steroids appear in human milk and could have adverse effects on the nursing infant. Caution should be exercised when loteprednol etabonate is administered to a nursing woman.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

## **Precautions**

*  Monitor intraocular pressure.
*  Avoid contact lens wear during treatment.
*  Do not discontinue therapy prematurely.
