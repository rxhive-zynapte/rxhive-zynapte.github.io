## **Usage**

Loxapine is prescribed for the management of schizophrenia and acute agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder.  It is classified as a first-generation (typical) antipsychotic medication.  Loxapine's mechanism of action involves antagonism of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in the brain, thus modulating dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission to alleviate psychotic symptoms.

## **Alternate Names**

Loxapine is also known as loxapine succinate. Brand names include Loxitane, Loxapac, and Adasuve.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Loxapine primarily acts by blocking dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in the brain. This receptor antagonism helps regulate dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission, reducing the positive symptoms of schizophrenia (like hallucinations and delusions) and managing agitation. Loxapine also demonstrates affinity for other receptors like histamine H1, alpha-adrenergic, and muscarinic receptors. Binding to these receptors contributes to some of the side effects associated with loxapine, such as sedation, orthostatic hypotension, and anticholinergic effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Loxapine is well-absorbed after oral administration.
* **Metabolism:** It undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism primarily through CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 enzymes to several active and inactive metabolites.
* **Elimination:** Loxapine is eliminated primarily via renal excretion and partly in feces through biliary elimination.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral (Schizophrenia):** Initial dose: 10 mg twice daily.  May be increased to up to 50 mg daily in severely ill patients. Usual maintenance dose is 60-100 mg/day, divided 2-4 times a day, not exceeding 250 mg/day.
* **Inhalation (Agitation):** 10 mg once within a 24-hour period.

#### **Children:**  Loxapine is not recommended for use in children under 18.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and titrate cautiously, considering age-related changes in drug clearance.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Use with caution and monitor renal function closely. Dosage adjustment may be needed.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution and monitor hepatic function. Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments may be needed based on the specific comorbid condition.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Loxapine is primarily used for the management of schizophrenia and acute agitation related to schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. It is not specifically indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use.  For emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest, other specific treatments are generally preferred.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on individual patient response, tolerability, and renal/hepatic function.  Genetic polymorphisms affecting CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 may influence drug metabolism.  Consider dose adjustments accordingly.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, nausea, insomnia, extrapyramidal symptoms (tremor, rigidity, restlessness), weight gain.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), tardive dyskinesia, agranulocytosis, seizures, severe allergic reactions, cardiac arrhythmias (QT prolongation).

### **Long-Term Effects**

Tardive dyskinesia, weight gain, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular complications.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

NMS, agranulocytosis, severe allergic reactions, QTc prolongation.


## **Contraindications**

Comatose states, severe CNS depression, hypersensitivity to loxapine or dibenzoxazepines, dementia-related psychosis.


## **Drug Interactions**

CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines), anticholinergic drugs, QT-prolonging agents, CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 inhibitors/inducers.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category: C. Use not recommended unless benefits outweigh risks.  Loxapine can cross the placenta, and third-trimester exposure is associated with neonatal extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms.  It is unknown if loxapine is excreted in human breast milk. Breastfeeding is generally not recommended during treatment with loxapine.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist.
* **Side Effects:** Dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, extrapyramidal symptoms, NMS, tardive dyskinesia.
* **Contraindications:** Coma, severe CNS depression, hypersensitivity to loxapine.
* **Drug Interactions:** CNS depressants, anticholinergics, QT-prolonging drugs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; risk of neonatal effects.
* **Dosage:** See dosage section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Mental status, extrapyramidal symptoms, weight, blood pressure, ECG, complete blood count, liver function tests.


## **Popular Combinations**

Loxapine is sometimes used in combination with other psychotropic medications for managing treatment-resistant schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. These may include mood stabilizers (lithium, valproate), or other antipsychotics.


## **Precautions**

Patients with cardiovascular disease, seizure disorders, diabetes, or hepatic/renal impairment require close monitoring.  Baseline ECG and regular monitoring for QTc prolongation are recommended.  Monitor for NMS, especially during initial treatment or dose increases.  Avoid abrupt discontinuation.
