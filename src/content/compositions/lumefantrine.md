      Can Lumefantrine be used in breastfeeding mothers?**

      **A:** Yes, it is considered acceptable for infants greater than 5 kg. 
      However, it is recommended that breastfeeding should not resume until at
      least one week after the last dose due to the long elimination half-life
      of lumefantrine.

## **Usage**

- Lumefantrine is an antimalarial drug used in combination with artemether for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria.  It is effective against the asexual blood stages of *P. falciparum*, but not against the gametocytes or hepatic stages. It is also not effective against other *Plasmodium* species like *P. vivax, P. malariae*, or *P. ovale*, but some patients in clinical studies had co-infection with *P. falciparum* and *P. vivax*.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antimalarial, specifically an aryl amino alcohol.

- **Mechanism of Action:** While the exact mechanism is not fully elucidated, lumefantrine is thought to interfere with heme polymerization within the malaria parasite's food vacuole.  This inhibits the formation of hemozoin, a non-toxic form of heme, leading to a buildup of toxic free heme, which damages the parasite.

## **Alternate Names**

-  Co-artemether (when used in combination with artemether).
- **Brand Names:** Coartem®

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Lumefantrine exerts its antimalarial activity by disrupting heme detoxification within the *Plasmodium falciparum* parasite. This accumulation of heme results in parasite death.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Oral absorption is enhanced when taken with fatty foods.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated via feces with a long elimination half-life (4-6 days), some renal excretion.

- **Mode of Action:** Inhibits heme polymerase within the *P. falciparum* food vacuole which in consequence prevents hemozoin formation, leading to toxic heme accumulation and parasite death.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4 followed by fecal excretion and to a lesser extent renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

Lumefantrine is administered in fixed combination with artemether. The following dosages are for the artemether-lumefantrine combination based on 20mg/120mg tablets and 80mg/480mg tablets.

#### **Adults (≥35 kg or >12 years):**
20mg/120mg: Initial dose of four tablets, followed by four tablets at 8 hours, then four tablets twice daily (morning and evening) for 2 days (total 24 tablets).
80mg/480mg: Initial dose of one tablet, followed by one tablet at 8 hours, then one tablet twice daily for 2 days (total 6 tablets).


#### **Children:**
* **5 kg to <15 kg:** Initial dose of one 20mg/120mg tablet, followed by one tablet at 8 hours, then one tablet twice daily for 2 days (total 6 tablets).
* **15 kg to <25 kg:** Initial dose of two 20mg/120mg tablets, followed by two tablets at 8 hours, then two tablets twice daily for 2 days (total 12 tablets).
* **25 kg to <35 kg:** Initial dose of three 20mg/120mg tablets, followed by three tablets at 8 hours, then three tablets twice daily for 2 days (total 18 tablets).

Pediatric safety considerations:  Safety and efficacy in infants less than 5 kg have not been fully established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised in severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised in severe hepatic impairment.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  

Lumefantrine-artemether is specifically indicated for **uncomplicated malaria** and is **not indicated** for severe malaria, prophylaxis, or use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or the ICU.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Headache, dizziness, weakness, muscle or joint pain, fatigue, insomnia, vomiting, anorexia, fever, chills, cough, abdominal pain.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Cardiac arrhythmias (including QT prolongation),  anaphylaxis, severe skin reactions.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** QT prolongation and cardiac events.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to artemether, lumefantrine, or any component of the formulation.
- Severe malaria.
- History of or family history of congenital QT prolongation or sudden cardiac death.
- Conditions known to prolong the QT interval.
- Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John's wort) or drugs known to prolong the QT interval.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Drugs that prolong the QT interval (e.g., antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics, some antibiotics).
- CYP3A4 inducers (decrease lumefantrine levels).
- CYP2D6 inhibitors (may increase lumefantrine levels).
- Mefloquine (reduces lumefantrine absorption).
- Halofantrine (should not be administered within one month of halofantrine).
- Grapefruit juice (increases artemether exposure).
- Hormonal contraceptives (efficacy may be reduced).
- Antiretroviral medications (interactions with efavirenz, nevirapine, ritonavir/lopinavir).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Recommended by WHO for uncomplicated *P. falciparum* malaria during all trimesters of pregnancy when the benefits outweigh the risks.  Animal studies have shown some evidence of embryotoxicity.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Use is considered acceptable in mothers nursing infants weighing at least 5 kg. Safety in infants weighing less than 5 kg is not established. Due to lumefantrine’s long half-life, breastfeeding interruption for one week after the last dose is recommended.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits heme polymerization in *P. falciparum*.
- **Side Effects:** Headache, dizziness, gastrointestinal disturbances, QT prolongation.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe malaria, QT prolongation risk factors, concurrent use of contraindicated drugs.
- **Drug Interactions:**  CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors, QT prolonging drugs.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe, but caution advised; WHO recommends for use in pregnancy when benefit outweighs risk. Safe for breastfeeding for infants >5kg after one week following treatment cessation.
- **Dosage:**  See detailed section above.


## **Popular Combinations**

- Artemether and lumefantrine are always given as a fixed-dose combination.


## **Precautions**

- Ensure adequate food intake for optimal absorption.
- Monitor for cardiac effects (QT prolongation).
- Use with caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
