      **A:** Adults: Schizophrenia: 40-160 mg/day; Bipolar Depression: 20-120
      mg/day. Children (Schizophrenia 13-17 years): 40-80 mg/day;  Children
      (Bipolar Depression 10-17 years): 20-80 mg/day. All doses are to be taken

      What are the key differences between lurasidone and other atypical
      antipsychotics?**


      **A:**  Lurasidone has a lower risk of weight gain and metabolic side
      effects compared to some other atypical antipsychotics.  It also has a
      lower affinity for muscarinic and histamine receptors, which may result in
      fewer anticholinergic and sedative side effects.  It's however important
      to monitor for extrapyramidal symptoms, similar to those observed with
      other atypical antipsychotics.

## **Usage**

- Lurasidone is prescribed for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and adolescents aged 13 years and older, and for depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (bipolar depression) in adults, both as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate.  It is also used in children aged 10-17 years old to treat depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Atypical antipsychotic (second-generation antipsychotic).
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Lurasidone is a serotonin-dopamine activity modulator (SDAM). It acts as an antagonist at serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors,  with partial agonist activity at 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors and antagonist activity at 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors.  It has negligible affinity for muscarinic M1 and histamine H1 receptors. This combined activity is believed to contribute to its antipsychotic and mood-stabilizing effects.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Lurasidone
- **Brand Name:** Latuda


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Lurasidone's therapeutic effects are primarily attributed to its antagonism of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors, coupled with partial agonism at 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors. Its low affinity for muscarinic and histamine receptors minimizes certain side effects, like dry mouth, blurred vision, and sedation commonly seen with some other antipsychotics.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Lurasidone is absorbed orally and its absorption is significantly enhanced when taken with food (at least 350 calories).
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by CYP3A4.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted in urine and feces.
- **Mode of Action:** Lurasidone binds to and blocks the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors.  Its partial agonism at 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors may contribute to mood stabilizing effects.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Antagonist at 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors; partial agonist at 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Hepatic metabolism (primarily CYP3A4), renal and fecal excretion.
