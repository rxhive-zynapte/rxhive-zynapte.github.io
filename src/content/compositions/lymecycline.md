## **Usage**

Lymecycline, a semi-synthetic derivative of tetracycline, is a broad-spectrum antibiotic primarily prescribed for the treatment of acne vulgaris and other bacterial infections susceptible to tetracyclines.  These infections can include:  acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis,  ear, nose, and throat infections, gastrointestinal infections,  non-gonococcal urethritis, rickettsial fever, soft tissue infections, trachoma, and urinary tract infections.  Its pharmacological classification is antibiotic. Lymecycline exerts its bacteriostatic effect by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis.

## **Alternate Names**

Lymecycline is also known as Tetralysal in some regions.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Lymecycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, blocking the attachment of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex. This prevents the addition of amino acids to the elongating peptide chain, thereby halting bacterial growth and multiplication.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Lymecycline is well-absorbed after oral administration, with absorption enhanced by an active transport mechanism across the intestinal wall. Unlike some other tetracyclines, its absorption is not significantly affected by milk. It readily crosses the placental barrier and is distributed into breast milk. Lymecycline is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily through the kidneys.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Acne:** 408 mg (equivalent to 300 mg tetracycline base) once daily, preferably in the morning, usually for at least 8 weeks. Treatment should not exceed 6 months.
* **Other Infections:** 408 mg twice daily. If higher doses are required, 900-1200 mg may be given over 24 hours.

#### **Children:**

Lymecycline is generally not recommended for children under 12 years of age due to the risk of permanent tooth discoloration and effects on bone development. For children over 12, the adult dosage may be used.  Some sources indicate it should not be used in children under 8.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dose adjustment is typically required.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is recommended in patients with renal impairment, as tetracycline excretion is reduced in these cases.  Lymecycline is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Lymecycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment due to the potential for drug accumulation and increased toxicity.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and myasthenia gravis are conditions warranting special precautions.



### **Clinical Use Cases** 

Lymecycline dosage guidelines for clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations are not specifically defined, and its use in these settings may depend on the specific infection being treated and the patient's condition. 



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  Dosage may need to be lowered in renal impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, headache, photosensitivity (increased sensitivity to sunlight).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), oesophageal irritation and ulceration,  benign intracranial hypertension,  *Clostridioides difficile*-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis,  hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, blood disorders (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), visual disturbances, skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Permanent tooth discoloration (yellow-gray-brown) can occur with prolonged use, especially in children under 12 years of age.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema),  severe skin reactions,  *C. difficile* infection.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to lymecycline or other tetracyclines, severe renal insufficiency,  pregnancy, breastfeeding, children under 8 or 12 (depending on the source), concurrent use with oral retinoids.

## **Drug Interactions**

Lymecycline can interact with:

* **Antacids, iron, calcium, magnesium, zinc, bismuth, and aluminum salts:** Reduced Lymecycline absorption
* **Quinapril:** Reduced Lymecycline absorption
* **Oral retinoids:** Increased risk of benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri)
* **Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin):** Enhanced anticoagulant effect.
* **Diuretics:** Potential for increased toxicity.
* **Antiepileptics (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine):** Altered metabolism of Lymecycline
* **Methoxyflurane:** Increased risk of renal failure
* **Penicillin and Î²-lactam antibiotics:** Interference with bactericidal action
* **Lithium:** Potential for increased serum levels of Lithium


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Lymecycline is contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding due to its potential to affect fetal and infant bone and tooth development, causing permanent tooth discoloration and enamel hypoplasia.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, photosensitivity. Rare but serious: allergic reactions, oesophageal irritation.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe renal impairment, pregnancy, breastfeeding, children under 8 or 12 (depending on the source), concomitant use with oral retinoids.
* **Drug Interactions:** Antacids, iron supplements, oral retinoids, anticoagulants, antiepileptics, methoxyflurane.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 408 mg once daily for acne, twice daily for other infections.  Children over 12:  Adult dose.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal and liver function tests (if appropriate), signs of superinfection.

## **Popular Combinations**

No specific "popular combinations" are widely recognized for Lymecycline.  Combination therapy may be considered in specific cases of severe or resistant infections, but this should be done under careful medical supervision, considering potential drug interactions and clinical appropriateness.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess renal and hepatic function if necessary, screen for hypersensitivity to tetracyclines, monitor for signs of superinfection.
* **Specific Populations:** Lymecycline is contraindicated in pregnant and breastfeeding women and in children under 8 or 12 (depending on the source). Use with caution in the elderly and patients with hepatic dysfunction.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Advise patients to avoid prolonged sun exposure and use sunscreen, avoid alcohol as it may exacerbate side effects, avoid dairy products near the time of taking the drug as it may affect absorption.
