## **Usage**

- Magnesium bisglycinate is primarily prescribed for the prevention and treatment of magnesium deficiency. It may also be used to address conditions associated with magnesium deficiency, such as muscle cramps, fatigue, migraines, and anxiety. Some studies suggest potential benefits for blood pressure regulation and blood sugar control in certain individuals.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Mineral Supplement, Magnesium Supplement
- **Mechanism of Action:** Magnesium is an essential cofactor for numerous enzymatic reactions in the body, impacting diverse physiological processes, including muscle and nerve function, blood pressure regulation, and blood glucose control.  Bisglycinate is an organic chelated form, promoting enhanced absorption and minimizing gastrointestinal side effects.

## **Alternate Names**

- Magnesium diglycinate, magnesium 2-aminoacetate
- Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Magnesium plays crucial roles in various physiological functions, including neuromuscular transmission, enzyme activity, blood pressure regulation, and energy metabolism. It acts as a natural calcium channel blocker, contributing to smooth muscle relaxation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Magnesium bisglycinate, being chelated to glycine, exhibits enhanced intestinal absorption compared to other forms of magnesium. It is metabolized primarily in the kidneys and excreted in the urine. Absorption is improved when taken with food.
- **Mode of Action:** Magnesium ions directly participate in hundreds of enzymatic reactions. Its influence on neuromuscular transmission involves modulating calcium channels. It promotes vasodilation by influencing smooth muscle relaxation. At a molecular level, it affects ATP utilization and numerous signaling pathways.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly renal excretion; dose adjustments needed for renal impairment.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 200-400 mg of elemental magnesium per day, taken orally with food, divided into two doses.

#### **Children:**

- Dosage should be determined by a pediatrician, considering age, weight, and clinical condition. Pediatric safety considerations should prioritize avoiding excessive dosages due to potential gastrointestinal intolerance.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage as per standard adult recommendations; monitor kidney function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is essential; monitor magnesium levels.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Generally, no dose adjustment is needed.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider case-specific adjustments based on interactions with other medications or conditions like diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Close monitoring is required.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation:**  Magnesium sulfate (not bisglycinate) may be used for blood pressure control during intubation in some hypertensive patients (e.g., 30 mg/kg IV infusion).
- **Surgical Procedures:**  May be given pre-operatively to prevent post-operative complications. Magnesium may interact with rocuronium, requiring dosage adjustments.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** May support sedation in critically ill patients as part of a sedative regimen.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  Often supplemented to address or prevent deficiency in critically ill patients.
- **Emergency Situations:** Magnesium sulfate (not bisglycinate) may be used to manage certain seizures.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Renal impairment necessitates dose reduction based on creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate.
- Drug interactions may influence dosage.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramps (less common with bisglycinate form), gastrointestinal discomfort


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), severe hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory depression (primarily associated with intravenous administration)

### **Long-Term Effects**

- No specific long-term adverse effects have been established for oral magnesium bisglycinate.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe hypotension, hypermagnesemia (requiring monitoring in renal dysfunction)

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to magnesium or glycine
- Severe renal impairment requiring dialysis
- Heart block, myasthenia gravis (caution with intravenous magnesium)


## **Drug Interactions**

- May reduce the absorption of certain antibiotics (tetracyclines, quinolones), bisphosphonates, and levothyroxine.
- May interact with certain medications like digoxin and diuretics.
- Alcohol may increase the risk of diarrhea.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding at recommended doses. Consult a healthcare professional before use.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Essential mineral involved in various enzymatic reactions, neuromodulation, and smooth muscle relaxation. Bisglycinate form offers superior absorption.
- **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, nausea, abdominal discomfort (less frequent with bisglycinate).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe renal impairment, heart block.
- **Drug Interactions:** Antibiotics (tetracyclines, quinolones), bisphosphonates, levothyroxine, digoxin, diuretics, alcohol.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Generally considered safe at recommended doses, consult a healthcare professional.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 200-400 mg elemental magnesium/day (oral, with food). Adjustments needed for renal impairment.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Serum magnesium levels (particularly in renal insufficiency), blood pressure, heart rate.


## **Popular Combinations**

- Often combined with other minerals or vitamins (e.g., calcium, vitamin D) depending on individual needs. Combinations used in clinical practice vary depending on the patient's conditions.


## **Precautions**

- Assess kidney function before and during treatment, especially at high doses.
- Monitor for gastrointestinal side effects.
- Caution advised in myasthenia gravis and heart block.
- Assess magnesium levels to guide dosing in renal impairment.
- Consider other medications for interactions.
- Dietary magnesium intake should be considered when calculating supplement dosage.
