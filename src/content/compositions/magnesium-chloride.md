## **Usage**

Magnesium Chloride is prescribed for the treatment and prevention of hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels in the blood). It is also used to treat seizures associated with eclampsia and pre-eclampsia, torsades de pointes (a type of irregular heartbeat), and severe asthma exacerbations.  It can also be used as a laxative.

Pharmacological classifications include:

* Mineral supplement
* Anticonvulsant (in specific circumstances like eclampsia)
* Laxative

Magnesium is a vital cofactor in hundreds of enzymatic reactions, impacting diverse physiological processes, including neuromuscular transmission, muscle contraction, and cardiac function.  It plays a critical role in protein synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and energy production.

## **Alternate Names**

* MgCl or MgCl2 (chemical formulas)
* Magnesium dichloride

Brand names vary depending on the formulation and country. Some examples include:

* Slow-Mag
* Chloromag
* Mag-SR

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Magnesium is crucial for numerous bodily functions, including nerve and muscle function, blood pressure regulation, blood glucose control, and protein synthesis. It acts as a cofactor for enzymes involved in energy metabolism and DNA/RNA synthesis.  Therapeutically, magnesium chloride can suppress or prevent seizures by reducing neuronal excitability and stabilizing cell membranes. In smooth muscle, it acts as a relaxant, which explains its utility in treating constipation and some types of menstrual cramps.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Oral magnesium absorption varies depending on the salt form. Magnesium chloride is considered highly soluble and generally well-absorbed. Absorption occurs primarily in the small intestine.
* **Distribution:** Following absorption, magnesium is distributed throughout the body, with the majority residing in bone, intracellular fluid, and muscle tissue.
* **Metabolism:** Magnesium is not metabolized in the liver.
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted by the kidneys; renal function significantly influences magnesium levels.

**Mode of Action:** Magnesium acts as a natural calcium channel blocker, which explains its anticonvulsant and smooth muscle relaxant effects. It also modulates NMDA receptors in the brain, further contributing to its anticonvulsant properties.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Oral: The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for elemental magnesium varies from 310-420 mg/day depending on age and sex. Dosages for treating magnesium deficiency should be individualized based on severity.

Intravenous: For conditions like eclampsia or torsades de pointes, administration is intravenous, with dosages guided by serum magnesium levels and clinical response.

#### **Children:**

Oral:  Pediatric dosages vary by age and should not exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL). These dosages are usually used for dietary supplementation:

* Infants under 6 months: 30 mg/day
* Infants 6-12 months: 75 mg/day
* Children 1-3 years: 80 mg/day
* Children 3-8 years: 130 mg/day
* Children 8-13 years: 240 mg/day
* Children 13-18 years:  410 mg/day (men); 360 mg/day (women)

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** May require lower dosages due to decreased renal function.  Careful monitoring is crucial.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction or avoidance is essential due to impaired magnesium excretion.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Generally, no dose adjustment is needed, as magnesium is not metabolized in the liver.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Individualized dosing is necessary, particularly for patients with cardiac conditions or taking medications that interact with magnesium.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Intubation and Surgical Procedures:** Magnesium sulfate, rather than magnesium chloride, is typically used as a muscle relaxant during these procedures.
* **Mechanical Ventilation and ICU Use:** Magnesium may be administered to manage electrolyte imbalances and maintain neuromuscular function in critically ill patients.
* **Emergency Situations (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest):** Intravenous magnesium sulfate is preferred in these situations.  Magnesium chloride can be utilized, but magnesium sulfate is more commonly available for intravenous use.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are crucial based on renal function, serum magnesium levels, and concurrent medications.  Regular monitoring of serum magnesium is essential, especially during intravenous therapy.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Abdominal cramping
* Flushing

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Hypotension (low blood pressure)
* Respiratory depression
* Cardiac arrest
* Hypermagnesemia (elevated magnesium levels)

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic excessive intake can lead to electrolyte imbalances and potential cardiovascular complications.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe hypermagnesemia requires immediate medical intervention and can manifest as respiratory paralysis, heart block, and profound hypotension.


## **Contraindications**

* Renal failure or severe renal impairment
* Heart block or other significant heart conditions
* Myasthenia gravis
* Comatose patients

## **Drug Interactions**

Magnesium can interact with various medications, including:

* **Antibiotics:** Tetracyclines, quinolones
* **Blood Pressure Medications:** Calcium channel blockers
* **Bisphosphonates:** Can reduce absorption
* **Diuretics:** Can increase magnesium loss

It's vital to consider potential interactions with other medications a patient may be taking.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Magnesium is essential during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Requirements increase during these periods, and supplementation may be necessary.  However, high doses of oral magnesium can cause diarrhea.  Intravenous administration should be used with caution and only when clearly needed.

Magnesium is excreted in breast milk.  While generally considered safe, monitoring is recommended for infants of mothers receiving high doses of magnesium.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Cofactor in numerous enzymatic reactions; calcium channel blocker; NMDA receptor modulator.
* **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, nausea, flushing, hypotension, respiratory depression (with high doses).
* **Contraindications:** Renal failure, severe heart conditions, myasthenia gravis.
* **Drug Interactions:** Antibiotics (tetracyclines, quinolones), calcium channel blockers, bisphosphonates.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Essential nutrient; supplementation may be required; high doses should be used cautiously.
* **Dosage:** Varies based on indication, age, and renal function. See detailed section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Serum magnesium levels (particularly with intravenous administration), renal function tests.

## **Popular Combinations**

Magnesium is often combined with vitamin B6 for premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and menstrual cramps.  It may also be combined with calcium and other minerals in some supplements.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Renal function assessment prior to administration, especially for high doses or intravenous therapy.
* **Specific Populations:** See section on 'Special Cases' under 'Dosage.'
* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Excessive alcohol intake can deplete magnesium levels.
