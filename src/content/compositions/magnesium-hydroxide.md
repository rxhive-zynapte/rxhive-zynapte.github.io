## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Magnesium hydroxide is prescribed for the relief of occasional constipation, indigestion (dyspepsia), heartburn, and upset stomach caused by excess gastric acid. It is also used to prepare the bowels for certain medical procedures.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Saline laxative, antacid.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  As an antacid, magnesium hydroxide neutralizes stomach acid. As a laxative, it increases water content in the intestines, stimulating bowel movements.

## **Alternate Names**

- Milk of Magnesia
-  Brand names: Phillips' Milk of Magnesia, Magnesia San Pellegrino

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Neutralizes gastric acid by reacting with hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the stomach to form magnesium chloride (MgCl2) and water.  Increases osmotic pressure within the intestinal lumen, drawing water into the gut and increasing stool volume. This stimulates peristalsis, promoting bowel evacuation. 
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The small amount that is absorbed is excreted renally. Unabsorbed magnesium is eliminated in the feces.
- **Mode of Action:**  Direct chemical neutralization of gastric acid (antacid effect); osmotic action in the intestine (laxative effect).
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Does not involve receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily fecal excretion of unabsorbed magnesium; renal excretion of the small amount of absorbed magnesium.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Antacid:** 400-1200 mg orally as needed, up to four times a day.
- **Laxative:** 2400-4800 mg orally per day, preferably at bedtime.
- Maximum daily dose (as magnesium hydroxide): up to 7200 mg depending upon the formulation.

#### **Children:**

- **Constipation:** 
    - 2 to under 6 years: 400-1200 mg orally once a day or in divided doses. Maximum dose: 1200 mg/day. 
    - 6 to under 12 years: 1200-2400 mg orally once a day or in divided doses. Maximum dose: 2400 mg/day. 
- **Dyspepsia:** Generally not recommended for children under 12. 
- Consult a healthcare professional for specific pediatric dosing guidelines based on age and weight.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to potential for decreased renal function. Monitor for hypermagnesemia.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Contraindicated in severe renal failure. Reduce dosage in moderate renal impairment and monitor serum magnesium levels.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Generally no dose adjustment is needed, but use cautiously.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with heart failure, edema, electrolyte imbalances.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations:** Dosage will depend on the specific clinical context and should be determined by the healthcare professional. MgSO4 (Magnesium Sulphate) not Mg(OH)2 might be used in these settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjust dosage based on renal function, patient response, and the presence of other medical conditions.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Diarrhea
- Abdominal cramping

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Hypermagnesemia (especially in patients with renal impairment) - symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, weakness,  hypotension, and respiratory depression.
- Allergic reactions


### **Long-Term Effects**

- Chronic use can lead to electrolyte imbalances.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe hypermagnesemia leading to cardiac or respiratory arrest.


## **Contraindications**

- Severe renal impairment/failure
- Hypersensitivity to magnesium hydroxide
- Acute gastrointestinal conditions (e.g., appendicitis, bowel obstruction)


## **Drug Interactions**

- Reduced absorption of tetracyclines, quinolones, iron supplements,  bisphosphonates, and other medications.
- Consult a comprehensive drug interaction database for specific interactions.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Consult a physician before use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Generally considered safe for occasional use, but prolonged use should be avoided.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Antacid (neutralizes gastric acid); Laxative (osmotic action).
- **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, abdominal cramping, hypermagnesemia (rare).
- **Contraindications:** Severe renal impairment, hypersensitivity, acute gastrointestinal conditions.

- Aluminum hydroxide (to reduce the risk of diarrhea)



## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess renal function, especially in elderly patients.  Avoid prolonged use.
- **Specific Populations (Pregnant Women, Breastfeeding Mothers, Children & Elderly):**  Consult a healthcare professional before use.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:**  None specifically related to magnesium hydroxide.
