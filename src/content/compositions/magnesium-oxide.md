## **Usage**

Magnesium oxide is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of magnesium deficiency, including hypomagnesemia. It is also used to treat symptoms of indigestion and heartburn (as an antacid) and occasional constipation (as a laxative). It is being studied for its potential benefits related to migraines, anxiety, blood pressure, blood sugar control, and premenstrual syndrome (PMS).  It is classified as a mineral supplement, antacid, and laxative. Magnesium is an essential mineral required for numerous bodily functions, including nerve and muscle function, blood sugar regulation, and blood pressure maintenance. Magnesium oxide works by providing a source of magnesium to the body, addressing deficiency and supporting these functions. As an antacid, it neutralizes stomach acid, relieving heartburn and indigestion. As a laxative, it draws water into the intestines, softening the stool and promoting bowel movements.

## **Alternate Names**

Magnesium oxide is also known as magnesia, Mag-Ox 400, Uro-Mag, and Mag-Caps.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Magnesium is an essential cofactor in hundreds of enzymatic reactions in the body. It plays a crucial role in muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, blood pressure regulation, protein synthesis, and energy production. Supplementing with magnesium oxide can correct magnesium deficiency and restore these physiological processes. In the context of constipation, magnesium oxide acts osmotically by drawing water into the intestinal lumen, leading to increased stool volume and easier passage. As an antacid, it neutralizes gastric acid, alleviating symptoms of heartburn and indigestion.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Magnesium oxide exhibits low bioavailability, meaning that a relatively small percentage of the ingested dose is absorbed into the systemic circulation.  It is primarily absorbed in the small intestine, but the presence of food can affect its absorption. Unabsorbed magnesium oxide is eliminated through the feces, which explains its laxative effect. Absorbed magnesium is primarily excreted by the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** Magnesium's action is exerted through various mechanisms. It modulates ion channels, influencing nerve and muscle excitability. It plays a vital role in calcium homeostasis, impacting muscle contraction and relaxation. It also affects the release of neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, and is involved in energy metabolism.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **General Supplementation/Migraine Prevention:** 400-500mg daily, may be divided into 2 doses. Some sources suggest higher doses for migraine prevention (up to 600 mg daily).
* **Constipation:** 1-2 grams daily or as directed. 
* **Antacid:** 400 mg as needed, up to twice daily. Do not exceed two tablets daily.

#### **Children:**

Dosage should be determined by a healthcare professional based on age, weight, and clinical condition. The recommended daily intake of elemental magnesium for children varies according to age:
* 1-3 years: 80 mg/day 
* 4-8 years: 130 mg/day
* 9-13 years: 240 mg/day
* 14-18 years: Females: 360 mg/day; Pregnant females: 400 mg/day; Males: 410 mg/day

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary depending on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction or avoidance may be required due to the risk of hypermagnesemia. Close monitoring is essential.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments typically required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Individualized adjustments based on specific comorbid conditions and concomitant medications may be needed.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Magnesium oxide's usage in specialized clinical settings, like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations is usually in the form of magnesium sulfate administered intravenously. These dosages and administration protocols are context-specific and determined by the clinical condition.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on renal function, patient tolerance, and clinical response. Monitoring serum magnesium levels may be helpful in guiding dosage adjustments, particularly in patients with impaired renal function.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Diarrhea, stomach upset, bloating, nausea, and gas.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Hypermagnesemia (high blood magnesium levels), which can lead to symptoms like muscle weakness, low blood pressure, confusion, slowed heart rate, and difficulty breathing.  Severe hypermagnesemia can be life-threatening. Allergic reactions such as itching, rash, or swelling are rare but possible.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic high doses can lead to hypermagnesemia, particularly in patients with kidney disease.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe hypermagnesemia, cardiac arrhythmias (in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions), allergic reactions.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to magnesium oxide, severe renal impairment, heart block, myasthenia gravis (for intravenous magnesium).

## **Drug Interactions**

Magnesium oxide can interact with numerous medications, including some antibiotics (tetracyclines, quinolones), bisphosphonates (used to treat osteoporosis), certain diuretics, and some medications for diabetes or heart conditions. It can also interfere with the absorption of certain medications. Consult drug interaction resources for detailed information before prescribing magnesium oxide concomitantly with other medications.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Magnesium oxide is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding when taken in recommended doses. However, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Provides magnesium, neutralizes stomach acid (antacid), draws water into intestines (laxative).
* **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, upset stomach, bloating, nausea, hypermagnesemia (rare but serious).
* **Contraindications:**  Hypersensitivity, severe renal impairment, heart block, myasthenia gravis (IV magnesium).
* **Drug Interactions:** Numerous drug interactions exist, consult resources for details.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe in recommended doses, consult a healthcare professional.
* **Dosage:** Varies based on indication and patient characteristics (see detailed dosage section).
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Serum magnesium levels (in patients with renal impairment or on higher doses).


## **Popular Combinations**

Magnesium oxide is often combined with vitamin B6, especially for PMS treatment. It may also be included in combination antacid or laxative products.

## **Precautions**

Pre-existing renal disease requires careful monitoring and dose adjustment. Patients with heart conditions should be monitored for potential arrhythmias. It is advisable to begin with a lower dose and titrate upwards based on individual response and tolerance. Advise patients to stay hydrated.
