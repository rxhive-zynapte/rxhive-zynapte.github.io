## **Usage**

Magnesium Trisilicate is an inorganic salt classified as an antacid. It is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic relief of heartburn, acid indigestion, dyspepsia, and other gastrointestinal complaints associated with hyperacidity.  It neutralizes excess gastric acid.

## **Alternate Names**

No commonly used alternate names exist for Magnesium Trisilicate, although it is often found in combination products marketed under various brand names like Gaviscon, Gelusil, and Magnomint.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Magnesium Trisilicate acts locally in the stomach by neutralizing gastric acid, thereby increasing the pH and reducing irritation to the esophageal and gastric mucosa. The silicon dioxide formed during the neutralization reaction may also coat the stomach lining, providing additional protection. It does not have any systemic effects under normal conditions.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Magnesium Trisilicate is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. After oral administration, it reacts with hydrochloric acid in the stomach to form magnesium chloride and silicon dioxide. A small amount of magnesium may be absorbed systemically, but this is usually clinically insignificant in individuals with normal renal function. The unabsorbed portion is excreted in the feces. The absorbed magnesium is primarily excreted by the kidneys. No specific information on its metabolism or involvement of CYP enzymes is available.

**Mode of Action:** Magnesium Trisilicate does not bind to receptors, inhibit enzymes, or modulate neurotransmitters. Its primary mechanism of action is chemical neutralization of gastric acid.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Liquid:** 10-20ml (2-4 5ml spoonfuls)
* **Tablets:** 1-2 tablets
Administer 20 minutes to 1 hour after meals and at bedtime, or as needed, up to once every hour.

#### **Children:**

* **Liquid:** 
    * 5-12 years: 5-10ml (1-2 5ml spoonfuls)
Not recommended for children under 5 years old.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to the potential for decreased renal function. Monitor for signs of hypermagnesemia.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Contraindicated in severe renal failure. Use with extreme caution in mild to moderate renal impairment due to the risk of magnesium accumulation and toxicity.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, cirrhosis of the liver, or those on a sodium-restricted diet due to the sodium content of some formulations.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations are not established. Magnesium Trisilicate is intended for short-term symptomatic relief of mild to moderate gastrointestinal hyperacidity and not routinely used in these clinical scenarios.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary in patients with renal impairment. Always consider individual patient factors when determining the appropriate dose.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Stomach cramps
* Flatulence
* Belching
* Chalky taste

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Hypermagnesemia (in patients with renal impairment): Symptoms may include muscle weakness, hypotension, bradycardia, drowsiness, confusion, and respiratory depression.
* Kidney stones (with prolonged, high-dose use)
* Allergic reactions (rare): Symptoms may include skin rash, itching, hives, and facial swelling.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Prolonged, excessive use may lead to the development of silica-based renal calculi.


## **Contraindications**

* Severe renal failure
* Hypophosphatemia
* Hypochlorhydria
* Metabolic or respiratory alkalosis
* Hypocalcemia
* Hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation

## **Drug Interactions**

Magnesium Trisilicate can interfere with the absorption of numerous medications, including:

* Tetracyclines
* Fluoroquinolones
* Azithromycin
* Levothyroxine
* Digoxin
* Phenytoin
* Iron preparations
* Bisphosphonates

It is recommended to administer other medications at least 1-2 hours before or after Magnesium Trisilicate.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Limited data are available on the use of Magnesium Trisilicate during pregnancy and breastfeeding. While it is not contraindicated, it should be used with caution only if the benefits outweigh the risks. Consult a physician before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Neutralizes gastric acid.
* **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, constipation, nausea, stomach cramps. Rarely, hypermagnesemia and kidney stones.
* **Contraindications:** Severe renal failure, hypophosphatemia.
* **Drug Interactions:** Numerous drug interactions, mainly affecting absorption.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
* **Dosage:**  Adults: 10-20ml or 1-2 tablets after meals and at bedtime. Children (5-12 years): 5-10ml.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Renal function in patients with renal impairment. Serum magnesium levels in cases of suspected hypermagnesemia.

## **Popular Combinations**

Magnesium Trisilicate is often combined with aluminum hydroxide to balance the potential for diarrhea and constipation. It is also formulated with alginic acid to form a protective barrier against gastric acid.

## **Precautions**

* Pre-existing kidney conditions
* Chronic diarrhea, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis
* Intestinal obstruction
* Cardiac failure, hypertension
* Sodium-restricted diet
* Children under 5 years
