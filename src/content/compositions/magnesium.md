## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Magnesium is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels), eclampsia and pre-eclampsia seizures, torsades de pointes (a type of irregular heartbeat), and preterm labor. It's also used to treat constipation and indigestion.  It is also used off-label for bronchospasm, acute nephritis, cerebral edema, and as an adjunct in refractory status epilepticus.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Mineral supplement, electrolyte, anticonvulsant (in specific settings like eclampsia), laxative, antacid.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Magnesium is essential for numerous enzymatic reactions in the body, especially those related to nerve and muscle function, protein synthesis, blood glucose control, and blood pressure regulation. It acts as a physiological calcium blocker and influences potassium channels. As an anticonvulsant, it likely acts by antagonizing N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, thereby reducing neuronal excitability.


## **Alternate Names**

- Magnesium sulfate (most common parenteral form)
- Magnesium oxide, magnesium citrate, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium chloride, magnesium gluconate, magnesium aspartate, magnesium lactate, magnesium glycerophosphate (oral forms)
- Brand names: Slow-Mag, Mag-Ox, Uro-Mag, and numerous others.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Magnesium influences diverse physiological processes. It's vital for nerve transmission, muscle contraction (including cardiac muscle), enzyme function, blood pressure regulation, glucose metabolism, and protein synthesis.  It has also been implicated in energy production, oxidative phosphorylation, and DNA replication and repair.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Oral absorption varies depending on the magnesium salt; magnesium glycinate is considered highly bioavailable. Absorption is reduced by high dietary fat intake.
    - **Distribution:** Primarily intracellular; a small fraction is bound to plasma proteins.
    - **Metabolism:** Not metabolized.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted primarily by the kidneys; renal insufficiency significantly impairs excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** Magnesium acts as a natural calcium antagonist, competing with calcium at binding sites and affecting calcium influx across cell membranes. It also influences potassium channels and may modulate neurotransmitter release. In anticonvulsant contexts, it likely inhibits NMDA receptors.  Furthermore, it plays a role in various enzymatic reactions through its interaction with ATP.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Antagonizes NMDA receptors, influences potassium channels, acts as a cofactor for numerous enzymes involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Oral:**  Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) varies; approximately 310-420 mg of elemental magnesium per day for adults, depending on age and sex. Individual needs can be higher depending on factors like stress, diet, and health conditions. Supplemental doses should not typically exceed 350 mg/day unless under medical supervision, as higher amounts increase the risk of adverse effects.
- **Intravenous/Intramuscular:** Dosing varies greatly depending on indication and severity. Always consult clinical guidelines for specific situations.

#### **Children:**

- Pediatric dosing should be determined based on age, weight, and clinical condition. Consult pediatric dosing references. 
- **Pediatric Safety Considerations:** Close monitoring for potential adverse reactions is required, particularly in neonates and infants.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Monitor renal function closely and adjust dose as needed.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce dose or avoid parenteral magnesium entirely in severe renal impairment, as it can lead to magnesium toxicity.  Monitor magnesium levels closely.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution, as hepatic impairment can increase the risk of developing renal dysfunction.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Adjust dosage as needed, especially in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or neuromuscular disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation:**  Magnesium may be used in the context of difficult airway management in some instances.
- **Surgical Procedures:**  Sometimes administered to support cardiovascular function or manage electrolyte imbalances.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:**  May be used in specific ventilator management scenarios, including patients with asthma.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  Frequently monitored and supplemented as needed for critically ill patients.
- **Emergency Situations:**
    - **Eclampsia/Pre-eclampsia:** 4-6 g IV loading dose followed by continuous infusion, targeting a therapeutic serum magnesium level.
    - **Torsades de pointes:** 1-2 g IV/IO bolus over 5-60 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion.
    - **Cardiac arrest (with torsades de pointes):** 1-2 g IV/IO push over 5-20 minutes.
    - **Refractory status epilepticus:** 4g bolus over 15 minutes, followed by maintenance infusion at 1-2g/hr, targeting a serum magnesium level of 8.5 mg/dL.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose modifications are essential for patients with renal/hepatic impairment. Start with lower doses and monitor magnesium levels frequently.
- Consider adjustments for other conditions affecting drug clearance, such as metabolic disorders.
