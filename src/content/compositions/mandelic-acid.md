## **Usage**

- Mandelic acid is primarily used in dermatology for treating acne, wrinkles, hyperpigmentation (dark spots), and photoaging (sun damage). It acts as a gentle exfoliant, removing dead skin cells to reveal brighter, smoother skin.  It can also improve skin texture by promoting collagen production, thereby enhancing firmness.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Keratolytic agent, Alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Mandelic acid exfoliates the skin by breaking down the bonds between dead skin cells.  Its antibacterial properties also help combat acne. The larger molecular size compared to other AHAs results in slower skin penetration, reducing irritation. It promotes collagen production, improving skin firmness and reducing wrinkles.


## **Alternate Names**

- Amygdalic acid
- Phenylglycolic acid
- 2-phenyl-2-hydroxyacetic acid
- Benzene acetic acid
- **Brand Names:** Numerous brands incorporate mandelic acid into their skincare products, some containing it as the primary active ingredient.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Mandelic acid's primary effect is exfoliation of the stratum corneum (outermost skin layer). It loosens the connections between dead skin cells, facilitating their removal and revealing new, healthier skin. It also promotes collagen synthesis, contributing to improved skin texture, firmness, and reduced wrinkles. Its antibacterial action helps manage acne.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** When applied topically, mandelic acid is absorbed into the skin.  Its larger molecular size compared to other AHAs results in slower absorption, minimizing irritation. It is then metabolized and eliminated through normal bodily processes.
- **Mode of Action:** Mandelic acid's keratolytic action involves disrupting the desmosomal connections between corneocytes (dead skin cells) in the stratum corneum. This promotes cell turnover and exfoliation.  Its antibacterial properties are attributed to its lipophilicity, allowing it to penetrate the sebaceous glands and inhibit bacterial growth.  The specific mechanism underlying its collagen-stimulating effect is not fully elucidated but likely involves modulating cellular signaling pathways involved in collagen synthesis.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  The primary mechanism is not receptor-mediated.  Its exfoliating action relies on chemical breakdown of intercellular bonds.  The antibacterial effect does not involve specific receptor or enzyme inhibition, but rather its ability to disrupt bacterial membranes. There is no known neurotransmitter modulation.
- **Elimination Pathways:** The metabolic fate and elimination pathways of topically applied mandelic acid are not well characterized.  It is assumed to be metabolized and excreted through normal bodily processes.


## **Dosage**

Mandelic acid dosage depends on individual skin type, tolerance, and the specific product formulation.


### **Standard Dosage**  

#### **Adults:**

- Topical application as a serum, cream, or peel.
- Concentrations typically range from 5% to 40% depending on product type (serums and daily-use products tend to have lower concentrations, whereas peels typically have higher concentrations, sometimes up to 50%).
- Start with a lower concentration (e.g., 5%) and gradually increase as tolerated.
- Frequency of application varies by product and concentration, ranging from a few times a week to daily use for lower concentrations.


#### **Children:**

- Not typically recommended for use in children except under the guidance of a dermatologist.


#### **Special Cases:** 

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower concentrations and increase gradually as tolerated, considering potential age-related skin sensitivity.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are generally necessary for topical application.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific dosage adjustments are generally necessary for topical application.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution and consult a dermatologist if there are coexisting skin conditions or allergies.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  

Mandelic acid is not typically used in acute medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary use is in dermatological practice for aesthetic and non-life-threatening skin conditions.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dosage adjustments are based primarily on skin tolerance and the desired effect.
- Reduce concentration or frequency of application if irritation occurs.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**  

- Mild irritation
- Redness
- Itching
- Dryness
- Peeling


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects** 

- Allergic reactions (rare)


### **Long-Term Effects**

- No known long-term systemic effects from topical application.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe allergic reactions (rare) requiring medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to mandelic acid or any component of the formulation.
- Active skin infections or open wounds.
- Known nut allergies (as mandelic acid is derived from almonds).


## **Drug Interactions**

- Avoid concomitant use with other exfoliating agents (e.g., retinoids, other AHAs, BHAs) as this can increase irritation.
- Use sunscreen diligently as mandelic acid can increase photosensitivity.
- Some medications, such as sulfonamides, can interact with mandelic acid (specifically methenamine mandelate, which is metabolized into mandelic acid), forming precipitates in urine.
- Salicylates can increase serum levels when used concurrently with methenamine mandelate as the latter acidifies urine, reducing salicylate excretion.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Mandelic acid is generally considered safe for topical use during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but it is advisable to consult with a doctor before using any new skincare products.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Exfoliates skin, promotes collagen synthesis, and possesses antibacterial properties.
- **Side Effects:** Mild irritation, redness, itching, dryness, and peeling.  Rarely, allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, active skin infections, open wounds, and nut allergies.
- **Drug Interactions:** Avoid concurrent use with other exfoliating agents, use sunscreen diligently, and consult a doctor about potential interactions with other medications.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally considered safe for topical use, consult with a doctor before use.
- **Dosage:** Varies based on individual skin type, tolerance, and the product. Start with a lower concentration (e.g., 5%) and increase gradually as tolerated.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Observe for signs of irritation or allergic reactions.


## **Popular Combinations**

- Mandelic acid is sometimes combined with hyaluronic acid in skincare products to provide both exfoliation and hydration.
- Combination with niacinamide can address multiple skin concerns concurrently, such as acne, hyperpigmentation, and wrinkles.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Perform a patch test before applying to the entire face, especially for sensitive skin. Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes.
- **Specific Populations:**
    - **Pregnant Women:** Consult a doctor before use.
    - **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Consult a doctor before use.
    - **Children & Elderly:**  Use with caution and under the guidance of a dermatologist.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Protect skin from sun exposure by using sunscreen with at least SPF 30.
