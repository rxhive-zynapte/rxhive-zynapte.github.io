## **Usage**

- Manganese is an essential trace mineral crucial for various physiological processes, including bone formation, wound healing, metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and cholesterol, and as a cofactor for numerous enzymes.  It is primarily used to treat or prevent manganese deficiency.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Mineral Supplement.  It functions as a cofactor, specifically for enzymes like superoxide dismutase (MnSOD).

## **Alternate Names**

- Manganese citrate, manganese gluconate, manganese sulfate, MnCl2

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Manganese acts as a cofactor for several enzymes, including glycosyltransferases (involved in cartilage formation), arginase (urea cycle), pyruvate carboxylase (gluconeogenesis), and MnSOD. MnSOD is a crucial antioxidant enzyme that protects mitochondria and cell membranes by scavenging superoxide radicals. Manganese contributes to bone health, wound healing, and carbohydrate and protein metabolism.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Manganese absorption is regulated based on the body's needs; lower levels lead to higher absorption rates. It primarily accumulates in mitochondria-rich tissues like bone, liver, pancreas, and kidneys. It is bound to the transport protein transmanganin (a beta-1-globulin). Excretion mainly occurs through bile and, to a lesser extent, through the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:**  Manganese's primary mode of action is its role as an enzyme cofactor.  MnSOD catalyzes the conversion of superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide, providing antioxidant protection. In bone formation, manganese-dependent enzymes facilitate glycosaminoglycan synthesis.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily biliary excretion with minor renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Recommended Adequate Intake (AI):**
    - Men: 2.3 mg/day
    - Women: 1.8 mg/day
- **Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL):** 11 mg/day

#### **Children:**

- AI varies with age:
    - 0-6 months: 0.003 mg/day
    - 7-12 months: 0.6 mg/day
    - 1-3 years: 1.2 mg/day
    - 4-8 years: 1.5 mg/day
    - 9-13 years: 1.9 mg/day (males), 1.6 mg/day (females)
    - 14-18 years: 2.2 mg/day (males), 1.6 mg/day (females)

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific adjustments mentioned, but start at the lower end of the dosage range due to potential age-related organ dysfunction.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; dose reduction or withholding may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution; dose reduction or withholding may be necessary due to impaired biliary excretion.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Patients with liver disease should be cautious due to potential manganese accumulation.  Patients with iron deficiency anemia may absorb more manganese.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Manganese supplementation is not routinely recommended for the following, however research is ongoing into effectiveness:

- **Intubation:** Not applicable.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Not applicable.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not applicable.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** May be included in parenteral nutrition (PN) formulations for long-term critically ill patients to prevent deficiency.  Monitor manganese levels, especially in those with liver dysfunction. 
- **Emergency Situations:** Not applicable.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- Adjust dosage based on renal and hepatic function and monitor manganese levels.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:** 
Generally well-tolerated at recommended doses.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Manganese toxicity (at high doses, chronic inhalation, or in patients with liver disease):  Symptoms include neurological effects resembling Parkinson's disease (tremors, muscle rigidity, gait disturbances), neuropsychiatric changes (mood alterations, hallucinations), and other systemic issues (pancreatitis).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Chronic high-dose manganese exposure can lead to irreversible neurological damage.


## **Contraindications**

- Known hypersensitivity to manganese.
- Severe liver disease.
- Premature infants (due to aluminum content in some injectable forms).

## **Drug Interactions**

- Antacids (magnesium-containing): May reduce manganese absorption.
- Laxatives (magnesium-containing): May reduce manganese absorption.
- Iron supplements: May be affected by manganese intake.
- Some antipsychotic medications: May worsen manganese-related side effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Adequate intake crucial. Pregnant women have a slightly higher AI (2.0 mg/day). Avoid exceeding the UL (11 mg/day).  Inhaled manganese is potentially unsafe during pregnancy.
- **Breastfeeding:** Higher AI (2.6 mg/day) during lactation. Avoid exceeding the UL (11 mg/day). Inhaled manganese is potentially unsafe while breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Cofactor for enzymes, particularly MnSOD, contributing to antioxidant defense, bone health, and metabolic processes.
- **Side Effects:** Generally well-tolerated; toxicity at high doses can cause neurological, neuropsychiatric, and systemic effects.
- **Contraindications:**  Hypersensitivity, severe liver disease, prematurity (for injectable forms).
- **Drug Interactions:** Magnesium-containing antacids and laxatives, iron supplements, certain antipsychotics.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Safe at recommended intake levels.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 2.3 mg/day (men), 1.8 mg/day (women); pediatric doses vary with age.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** For patients on PN or with suspected toxicity, monitor blood manganese levels, liver function tests, and neurological status.


## **Popular Combinations:**
Often combined with calcium, zinc, and copper for bone health.


## **Precautions**

- Caution in patients with liver or biliary tract impairment.  
- Monitor aluminum content in injectable forms for renal impairment and premature infants.
