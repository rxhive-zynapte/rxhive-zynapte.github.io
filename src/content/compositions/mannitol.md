## **Usage**

- Mannitol is prescribed for the following medical conditions:
    - Reduction of elevated intracranial pressure and cerebral edema, particularly when the blood-brain barrier remains intact.
    - Reduction of elevated intraocular pressure when other methods are ineffective.
    - Promotion of diuresis in the prevention and/or treatment of the oliguric phase of acute renal failure before irreversible renal failure occurs.
    - Promotion of the elimination of renally excreted toxic substances in poisoning cases.  It is used in the treatment of rhabdomyolysis and cisplatin, and methotrexate-induced acute renal failure.
    - Prevention of acute tubular necrosis or acute kidney injury in high-risk patients (e.g. patients undergoing major surgery)
    - Transurethral prostatic resection using mannitol irrigation reduces the incidence of hemolysis and hyponatremia as a consequence of absorption of hypotonic irrigation fluid during the procedure.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Osmotic diuretic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Mannitol exerts its effects by increasing the osmolarity of various body fluids, primarily plasma and extracellular fluid. This creates an osmotic gradient that draws water out of tissues, including the brain and eyes, and into the vascular space. In the kidneys, mannitol increases the osmotic pressure within the renal tubules, inhibiting water reabsorption and thus promoting diuresis.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:** The generic name "mannitol" is generally consistent internationally.
- **Brand Names:** Osmitrol

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Mannitol primarily works by altering osmotic gradients, leading to fluid shifts.  It reduces intracranial and intraocular pressure by drawing water from these compartments into the vascular space and enhances urine output by limiting water reabsorption in the kidneys. It's action is rapid, observed within 15 to 30 minutes.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Mannitol is administered intravenously and does not undergo absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.
    - **Distribution:**  It is primarily distributed in the extracellular fluid and does not cross the blood-brain barrier under normal circumstances.
    - **Metabolism:** Mannitol is not metabolized.
    - **Elimination:** It is excreted unchanged primarily by the kidneys through glomerular filtration.  A small amount is eliminated through bile and intestinal mucosa. The duration of its effect is dose-dependent and can last from 2 to 6 hours following intravenous administration.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Acute Renal Failure:** 50 to 200 g/24 hours (maximum single dose of 50 g).  The infusion rate is adjusted to maintain a urine flow of at least 30-50 mL/hour.
- **Reduction of Intracranial Pressure:** 0.25 to 2 g/kg as a 15% to 25% solution infused over 30 to 60 minutes.
- **Reduction of Intraocular Pressure:** 1.5 to 2 g/kg as a 15% to 25% solution infused over 30 to 60 minutes.
- **Forced Diuresis (poisoning):** Initial loading dose: 25g; Maintenance: Adjust dose to maintain urine output of at least 100 mL/hour and positive fluid balance of 1-2 litres. 

#### **Children:**

- **Renal Insufficiency Test Dose:** 200 mg/kg over 3-5 minutes.
- **Renal Insufficiency Treatment Dose:** 0.5 to 1.5 g/kg.  This may be repeated once or twice, with an interval of 4-8 hours, if necessary.
- **Cerebral and Ocular Edema:** 1 to 2 g/kg infused over 30 to 60 minutes.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Similar to adults, adjust dose based on weight, clinical condition, renal function, and concomitant therapy.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Administer a test dose (200 mg/kg over 3-5 minutes) before initiating therapy to assess renal function.  If there is an inadequate response to a second test dose, mannitol should be discontinued. Careful monitoring of fluid and electrolyte balance is necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustment is typically required for patients with hepatic dysfunction as mannitol is not extensively metabolised by the liver.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate patient status, including fluid and electrolyte balance, renal, cardiac, and pulmonary function, and address any imbalances before and during mannitol administration. If any of these functions deteriorates during treatment, mannitol must be stopped.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation:** Not routinely indicated.
- **Surgical Procedures (to prevent acute renal failure):** 50 to 100 g as a 5%, 10%, or 15% solution.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not routinely indicated.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Monitor fluid and electrolyte balance, serum osmolarity, renal, cardiac, and pulmonary function closely.
- **Emergency Situations (e.g., raised ICP):** 0.25 to 1 g/kg IV infused over 20-30 min. Repeat doses can be given based on the osmolar gap.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Monitor urine output during infusion.
- Adjust dose based on patient response and side effects.
