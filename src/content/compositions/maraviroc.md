## **Usage**

- Maraviroc is prescribed for the treatment of CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection in adults and children aged 2 years and older. It is crucial to confirm CCR5-tropism before initiating therapy.  It is always used in combination with other antiretroviral medications.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** CCR5 antagonist, antiretroviral.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Maraviroc works by selectively and reversibly binding to the CCR5 co-receptor on the surface of CD4+ T-cells. This action blocks the HIV-1 virus from entering the host cell, thus inhibiting viral replication. It is effective only against HIV-1 strains that use the CCR5 co-receptor for cell entry (CCR5-tropic).

## **Alternate Names**

- International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Maraviroc.
- **Brand Names:** Selzentry, Celsentri.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Maraviroc prevents HIV-1 entry into CD4+ T-cells by allosterically blocking the CCR5 co-receptor. This inhibits the gp120 viral envelope protein from interacting with the co-receptor, preventing fusion and entry of the virus into the host cell.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Maraviroc is absorbed orally with a bioavailability of approximately 23% for the tablet and 33% for the oral solution. Food does not significantly affect absorption.
    - **Metabolism:**  Primarily metabolized in the liver, mainly by CYP3A4.
    - **Elimination:**  Excreted primarily in feces, with a smaller amount in urine. The half-life is approximately 14 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Maraviroc binds allosterically to the CCR5 receptor, inducing a conformational change that prevents interaction with the viral gp120 protein.
- **Receptor Binding:**  Specifically targets the CCR5 co-receptor on CD4+ T-cells.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism (CYP3A4) followed by fecal excretion; a smaller amount is excreted in urine.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The standard adult dose varies depending on concomitant medications due to drug interactions. It is usually 300 mg twice daily. Dose adjustments are needed depending on the co-administered antiretrovirals, especially CYP3A inhibitors and inducers.

#### **Children:**

- Children (2 years and older): Dosage is based on body weight and concomitant medications.  Oral solution and tablet formulations are available. Dose adjustments are made based on weight and co-administered drugs, particularly CYP3A inhibitors and inducers.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are recommended based on age alone, but consider renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Contraindicated in severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) when administered with potent CYP3A inhibitors or inducers.  Dosage modifications are required for lesser degrees of impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments are recommended, but monitor closely for hepatotoxicity.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised for patients with cardiovascular disease.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Maraviroc is not indicated for use in clinical scenarios such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  It is specifically indicated for the treatment of CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection in combination with other antiretrovirals.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are needed based on drug interactions, especially involving CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers, and renal function.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Cough, fever, upper respiratory tract infections, rash, dizziness, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, headache.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Hepatotoxicity (including life-threatening liver failure), severe skin reactions, allergic reactions, cardiovascular events.

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Increased risk of certain infections and malignancies associated with HIV infection itself, metabolic changes (e.g., dyslipidemia, insulin resistance).


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Hepatotoxicity, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, anaphylaxis.



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to maraviroc.
- Severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min) or ESRD in patients taking potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.


## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** Reduce maraviroc dose (e.g., protease inhibitors, azole antifungals, some macrolides).
- **CYP3A4 Inducers:** Increase maraviroc dose (e.g., rifampin, efavirenz, carbamazepine).
- Many other drug interactions exist; refer to a comprehensive drug interaction resource for detailed information.
- Interactions with food (e.g., grapefruit juice) and lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking) are not clinically significant.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Insufficient human data to establish safety; however, animal data do not indicate developmental toxicity.  Maraviroc levels may be decreased during pregnancy.
- **Breastfeeding:** Maraviroc should not be used during breastfeeding due to the risk of infant exposure and potential HIV transmission through breast milk.  Women with HIV should not breastfeed.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** CCR5 antagonist, blocks HIV-1 entry into CD4+ cells.
- **Side Effects:** Cough, fever, rash, dizziness, hepatotoxicity, severe skin reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe renal impairment with CYP3A modulators.
- **Drug Interactions:** Numerous, especially with CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Insufficient data, not recommended.
- **Dosage:** Adult: 300 mg BID (adjusted based on drug interactions); Pediatric: weight-based.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Liver function tests, HIV viral load, CD4+ cell count, renal function, signs of hypersensitivity reactions.



## **Popular Combinations**

Maraviroc is combined with other antiretroviral agents based on individual patient characteristics, including resistance testing and potential drug interactions.  No specific combinations are universally "popular."


## **Precautions**

- Assess for CCR5-tropism before starting therapy.
- Monitor liver function, renal function, and watch for signs of hypersensitivity reactions.
- Avoid in pregnancy and breastfeeding.
- Caution in patients with cardiovascular disease.
