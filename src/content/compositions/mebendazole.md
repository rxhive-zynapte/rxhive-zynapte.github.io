## **Usage**

Mebendazole is an anthelmintic (anti-worm) medication prescribed for the treatment of various parasitic worm infections, including:

*   Roundworm (Ascariasis)
*   Hookworm (Ancylostomiasis, Necatoriasis, Uncinariasis)
*   Pinworm (Enterobiasis, Oxyuriasis)
*   Whipworm (Trichuriasis)

Its pharmacological classification is anthelmintic.

Mebendazole works by selectively inhibiting the synthesis of microtubules in intestinal worms. This disruption of microtubules affects the worms' uptake of glucose, leading to energy depletion and ultimately their death.

## **Alternate Names**

Mebendazole is also known by various brand names, including Vermox®, Ovex®, and Emverm™.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Mebendazole acts locally in the intestine, with minimal systemic absorption.  It primarily targets the parasitic worms by binding to their beta-tubulin, a protein that forms microtubules.  These microtubules are essential for various cellular processes in the worms, including glucose uptake, intracellular transport, and cell division. By disrupting microtubule function, mebendazole leads to impaired glucose uptake, causing energy depletion and ultimately the death of the worm.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Mebendazole is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Food, especially high-fat meals, may increase absorption slightly. The small amount absorbed is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by the CYP450 enzymes. Mebendazole is mainly eliminated in the feces, with a small portion excreted in the urine. The elimination half-life of the parent drug and its metabolites is variable, ranging from 2.5 to 5.5 hours.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

A single dose of 100 mg is recommended for pinworm infections, and this dose can be repeated in 2-4 weeks if necessary. For other worm infections (roundworm, hookworm, whipworm), 100 mg twice daily (morning and evening) for three consecutive days is the typical dosage.

#### **Children:**

The dosage for children over 2 years of age is the same as for adults.  For children under 2 years old, the dosage and use should be determined by a doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are typically required.  Monitor for potential adverse events.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution is advised in patients with renal impairment.  Dose adjustments may be necessary.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Mebendazole is metabolized in the liver, so caution should be exercised in patients with hepatic impairment. Dosage adjustments might be required.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider any potential drug interactions with other medications the patient might be taking.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosages provided are for general treatment of worm infections and not specifically applicable to the scenarios listed (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, emergency situations).  These settings are not standard situations where Mebendazole would be indicated or require specific dosing.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

*   Diarrhea
*   Abdominal pain or discomfort
*   Nausea
*   Vomiting
*   Loss of appetite
*   Headache
*   Dizziness

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

*   Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, swelling)
*   Seizures
*   Fever and chills
*   Severe abdominal pain
*   Bloody stools
*   Unusual tiredness or weakness
*   Jaundice

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term side effects are uncommon with the usual short-term treatment of mebendazole.

## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to mebendazole or any of its components.
*   Pregnancy (first trimester; subsequent use should only be if clearly needed).
*   Concomitant use with metronidazole.

## **Drug Interactions**

*   Cimetidine: May increase mebendazole plasma concentrations.
*   Metronidazole: Concomitant use may increase the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis.
*   Phenytoin and Fosphenytoin: May decrease mebendazole levels.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Mebendazole is generally avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy.  Its use during the second and third trimesters should be considered only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus.  Limited data suggests it is excreted into breast milk in small amounts. However, it's generally considered safe to use while breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits microtubule synthesis in worms, leading to energy depletion and death.
*   **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, rare allergic reactions or seizures.
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, first trimester of pregnancy, concomitant use with metronidazole.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Cimetidine, metronidazole, phenytoin.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid in the first trimester; use with caution thereafter. Generally safe during breastfeeding.
*   **Dosage:** 100 mg single dose (pinworm) or 100 mg twice daily for 3 days (other worm infections).
*   **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for resolution of symptoms and recurrence of infection.  In prolonged therapy or high doses, monitor complete blood count (CBC) and liver function tests (LFTs).

## **Popular Combinations**

Mebendazole is typically used as a single agent. There are no widely recognized "popular" drug combinations.

## **Precautions**

*   Strict hygiene measures are crucial to prevent re-infection, including handwashing, cleaning of toilets, and laundering of bedding.
*   Monitor patients with liver disease carefully.
