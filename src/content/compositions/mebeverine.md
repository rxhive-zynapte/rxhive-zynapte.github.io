## **Usage**

- Mebeverine is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other gastrointestinal conditions characterized by smooth muscle spasms, such as abdominal pain, cramps, persistent non-specific diarrhea (with or without alternating constipation), and flatulence.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Antispasmodic, Musculotropic antispasmodic agent.
- Mebeverine acts directly on the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract, relaxing the muscle spasms without affecting normal gut motility. The exact mechanism is unknown, but multiple pathways may contribute to this effect.

## **Alternate Names**

- Mebeverine hydrochloride.
- **Brand Names:** Colofac®, Aurobeverine®, Duspatal® (international variations may exist).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Mebeverine exerts a direct relaxant effect on the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract.  It does not interfere with normal peristalsis.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Mebeverine is well-absorbed after oral administration.  It is metabolized in the liver, primarily by ester hydrolysis. The main metabolite is veratric acid. Excretion occurs through the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:** Mebeverine acts directly on the smooth muscle cells, potentially through calcium channel blockade, though the precise mechanism is still not fully elucidated.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation**: Although classified as an anticholinergic, it exhibits minimal antimuscarinic effects.
- **Elimination pathways:** Renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Standard-release tablets (135 mg):** One tablet three times daily, taken 20 minutes before meals.
