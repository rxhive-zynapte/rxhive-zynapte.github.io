      What should I do if my patient experiences vomiting after taking
      Mefloquine?**


      **A:** If vomiting occurs within 30 minutes of taking the medication,
      repeat the full dose. If vomiting occurs 30-60 minutes after dosing,
      repeat half the dose.  If vomiting persists, contact a physician for
      guidance.

      Can Mefloquine be used for all types of malaria?**


      **A:** No, Mefloquine is only effective against mefloquine-susceptible
      strains of *P. falciparum* and *P. vivax*. It is not effective against
      other malarial species (e.g., *P. ovale*, *P. malariae*) or against
      resistant strains of *P. falciparum*.

## **Usage**

- Mefloquine is prescribed for the *prevention and treatment of malaria*, caused by mefloquine-susceptible strains of *Plasmodium falciparum* (both chloroquine-susceptible and resistant strains) and *Plasmodium vivax*.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antimalarial.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Mefloquine destroys the malaria parasite within red blood cells by inhibiting heme polymerization.  It accumulates in infected red blood cells where it forms toxic complexes with heme, a substance released during hemoglobin digestion by the parasite. This build-up disrupts the parasite's metabolic processes and ultimately leads to its death.

## **Alternate Names**

- Mefloquine hydrochloride
- **Brand Name:** Lariam (no longer marketed in the US)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Mefloquine concentrates within parasitized red blood cells, interfering with the parasite's ability to detoxify heme, a byproduct of hemoglobin breakdown. This heme accumulation is toxic to the malaria parasite.  Mefloquine also appears to interfere with parasite DNA replication and protein synthesis, thus halting parasite growth and multiplication.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Well-absorbed orally, enhanced by food intake.
    - **Metabolism:**  Hepatic metabolism (mainly via CYP3A4), with a long elimination half-life (2-4 weeks).  
    - **Elimination:** Primarily biliary excretion, with minimal renal clearance.
- **Mode of Action:**  Blood schizonticide and some tissue schizonticidal activity.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** The precise molecular mechanisms of mefloquine's action are not fully elucidated. Although it appears to bind to parasite DNA, specific receptors have not yet been identified. 
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily biliary excretion, with a small fraction (<10%) excreted unchanged in urine.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Treatment:** 1250 mg (five 250 mg tablets or a single 1250 mg dose) orally as a single dose.  A divided dose (two doses 6-8 hours apart) may reduce gastrointestinal side effects.
- **Prevention:** 250 mg orally once a week, starting 1-3 weeks before travel to a malaria-endemic area. Continue weekly dosing during travel and for 4 weeks after leaving the area.

#### **Children:**

- **Treatment:** 20-25 mg/kg as a single dose or divided into two doses (6-8 hours apart). The doctor should always determine the dose.
- **Prevention:** Based on weight:
   -  >45 kg: Same as adult dose
   - 30-45 kg: 187.5 mg (¾ tablet) weekly
   - 20-30 kg: 125 mg (½ tablet) weekly
   - 10-19 kg: 62.5 mg (¼ tablet) weekly
- Children under 6 months: Use and dosage must be determined by a doctor.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be needed due to potential age-related decline in liver and kidney function. Monitor closely.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments usually not necessary due to minimal renal excretion.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution, as mefloquine is primarily metabolized by the liver. Close monitoring and dose adjustments may be required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Pre-existing psychiatric conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, psychosis) or seizure disorders are contraindications. Caution is advised in patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Mefloquine is specifically indicated for malaria prevention and treatment, not for the listed clinical settings (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations). These procedures are not relevant to mefloquine's therapeutic use.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modification is not usually required except for hepatic dysfunction and comorbid conditions mentioned above.

## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP450 Interactions:** Mefloquine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin) may increase mefloquine levels, while inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin) can decrease levels.
- **Other Interactions:**
    - Halofantrine, ketoconazole (contraindicated due to risk of cardiotoxicity)

    - Live attenuated vaccines (efficacy may be reduced)

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  While generally considered safe for all trimesters, mefloquine should only be used if the benefits outweigh the risks. Malaria infection poses significant risks during pregnancy. Consult a physician for thorough assessment and counseling.
- **Fetal Risks:** No evidence of increased risk of congenital malformations or adverse pregnancy outcomes.
- **Drug Excretion in Breast Milk:**  Mefloquine is excreted in breast milk in small amounts, but it is generally considered safe for breastfeeding.
- **Neonatal Side Effects:** Limited data on neonatal effects, but generally considered safe.
