## **Usage**

Megestrol acetate is a synthetic progestin, a drug that mimics the effects of the naturally occurring female hormone progesterone. It is primarily prescribed for the following conditions:

*   **Anorexia, cachexia, or significant weight loss in patients with AIDS:** Megestrol stimulates appetite and promotes weight gain, which can be particularly beneficial for individuals experiencing these symptoms due to AIDS.
*   **Palliative treatment of advanced breast cancer and endometrial cancer:** Although not a curative treatment, megestrol can help manage symptoms associated with these cancers.


Pharmacological classification: **Appetite stimulant, antineoplastic (for cancer treatment)**.

Mechanism of action: Megestrol's exact mechanism for stimulating appetite is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve interactions with the hypothalamus, a region of the brain that regulates appetite and metabolism. It also has anti-estrogenic and anti-androgenic effects, which contribute to its use in hormone-sensitive cancers.


## **Alternate Names**

*   Megestrol acetate

Brand names:

*   Megace
*   Megace ES


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Megestrol's primary effect is to increase appetite and promote weight gain. In cancer treatment, its anti-estrogenic and anti-androgenic properties inhibit tumor growth.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Megestrol is readily absorbed after oral administration.
*   **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver, potentially by CYP3A4 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs).
*   **Elimination:** Primarily excreted in urine (57-78% within 10 days with normal renal function).

**Mode of Action:** Megestrol likely interacts with hypothalamic neuropeptides involved in appetite regulation, although the exact mechanism remains unclear. It binds to progesterone receptors and exerts anti-estrogenic and anti-androgenic effects.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Binds to progesterone receptors. CYP3A4 may also be involved in its metabolism, leading to potential drug interactions.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion, with some hepatic metabolism.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   **Anorexia/Cachexia/Weight loss (AIDS):**
    *   Megace: 800 mg orally once daily (20 mL of 40 mg/mL suspension).
    *   Megace ES: 625 mg orally once daily (5 mL of 125 mg/mL suspension).
*   **Breast cancer:** 40 mg orally four times a day.
*   **Endometrial cancer:** 40-320 mg orally per day in divided doses. Treatment should be continued for at least two months to assess efficacy. Up to 800 mg/day may be used.

#### **Children:**

The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Use and dosage must be determined by a doctor. Off-label use for anorexia/cachexia: Up to 15 mg/kg/day or 800 mg/day.


#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Initiate therapy at the lower end of the dosing range due to the increased risk of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dosage adjustments may be necessary as megestrol is significantly excreted by the kidneys. Close monitoring of renal function is recommended.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution.  Dosage adjustments may be required due to potential metabolic changes.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions (Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease, etc.):** Monitor closely due to potential exacerbation of these conditions.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Megestrol acetate is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its primary use is for appetite stimulation and treatment of certain cancers as described above.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are based on patient-specific factors like renal or hepatic impairment, presence of comorbid conditions, and response to therapy. Monitor blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes.


## **Side Effects**

## **Drug Interactions**

*   Indinavir: Megestrol may significantly reduce indinavir exposure, requiring a dose adjustment of indinavir.
*   Diabetes medications (e.g., insulin, metformin): Megestrol may decrease the effectiveness of these medications, leading to increased blood sugar levels.
*   CYP3A4 substrates: Potential for interactions exists.
*   Consult drug interaction checkers for a complete list of potential interactions.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

*   Pregnancy Safety Category: X (Contraindicated)
*   Fetal Risks: Megestrol may cause fetal harm, including masculinization of female fetuses.
*   Breastfeeding: Megestrol is excreted in breast milk and may have adverse effects on the newborn. Breastfeeding should be discontinued if megestrol is required.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** Stimulates appetite, potentially via hypothalamic interactions. Exerts anti-estrogenic and anti-androgenic effects.
*   **Side Effects:** Weight gain, increased appetite, GI disturbances, impotence, rash, insomnia, thromboembolic events, adrenal insufficiency, hyperglycemia.
*   **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, hypersensitivity.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Indinavir, diabetes medications, CYP3A4 substrates.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy. Breastfeeding should be discontinued.
*   **Dosage:** Varies based on indication. See detailed dosage guidelines above.

## **Popular Combinations**

Megestrol is not typically used in combination therapies except when managing drug interactions (e.g., adjusting indinavir dose when co-administered).


## **Precautions**

Pre-screening for allergies, diabetes, adrenal disorders, and history of thromboembolic events is crucial. Monitor patients closely for side effects, particularly in elderly patients and those with renal or hepatic impairment. Advise patients about potential drug interactions. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception.
