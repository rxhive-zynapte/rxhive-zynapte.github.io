## **Usage**

- Melitracen is primarily prescribed for the treatment of depression and anxiety.  It is classified as a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA).
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Tricyclic Antidepressant (TCA)
- **Mechanism of Action:** Melitracen increases the levels of norepinephrine and serotonin, two neurotransmitters crucial for mood regulation, in the brain by inhibiting their reuptake at nerve synapses.  This leads to elevated concentrations of these neurotransmitters, alleviating symptoms of depression and anxiety.

## **Alternate Names**

- Melitracen hydrochloride is sometimes used to refer to the salt form of the drug used in formulations.
- While Melitracen itself is a generic name, it is often marketed in combination with Flupentixol under brand names like Deanxit and Melixol.  Other brand names may exist regionally.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Melitracen primarily exerts its antidepressant effect by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine at presynaptic nerve terminals. This action leads to increased concentrations of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft, potentiating their effects on postsynaptic receptors. It also exhibits some anticholinergic and antihistaminic properties, which contribute to some of its side effects.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Melitracen is well-absorbed orally. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within approximately 4 hours. It undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, primarily by CYP450 enzymes, and is subsequently excreted mainly through the kidneys. The half-life of Melitracen is approximately 19 hours, while the half-life of Flupentixol (when used in combination) is about 35 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Melitracen blocks the reuptake pumps for serotonin and norepinephrine, located on the presynaptic neuronal membrane.  This blockage prevents the removal of these neurotransmitters from the synapse, allowing them to interact with their receptors for a longer duration and increased effect.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Melitracen primarily inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. It may also have some affinity for histamine and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, contributing to its side-effect profile.  
- **Elimination Pathways:** Melitracen is metabolized in the liver via CYP450 enzymes and primarily eliminated renally.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Melitracen Hydrochloride: 25 mg two to three times daily. The dose can be gradually increased to a maximum of 225 mg daily if needed.
- Flupentixol + Melitracen combination: One tablet (containing 0.5 mg Flupentixol and 10 mg Melitracen) twice daily, in the morning and at noon. In severe cases, the morning dose may be increased to two tablets. The maximum daily dose is four tablets.


#### **Children:**

- Melitracen is generally not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate treatment with a reduced dose of 25-30 mg daily for Melitracen Hydrochloride or one tablet of the combination product once daily in the morning.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary. Specific guidelines based on eGFR are lacking in the provided sources.  Clinical judgment and close monitoring are advised.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution should be exercised, and dosage adjustment may be required. Specific recommendations are absent in the provided sources, so clinical monitoring is crucial.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, glaucoma, urinary retention, and a history of seizures. Adjust dosage as needed.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources primarily focus on Melitracen's use in depression and anxiety. There is no information on its use in intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It is not indicated for such settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on patient response, tolerability, and renal or hepatic function.  Gradual dose reduction is recommended when discontinuing Melitracen to minimize withdrawal symptoms.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Dry mouth
- Constipation
- Blurred vision
- Drowsiness/fatigue
- Dizziness
- Tremor
- Insomnia
- Restlessness/agitation
- Headache


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (when used with Flupentixol)
- Seizures
- Cardiac arrhythmias (including QT prolongation)
- Suicidal thoughts or behavior
- Extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g., tardive dyskinesia, akathisia)


### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Tardive dyskinesia (with prolonged Flupentixol combination use)


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Serotonin syndrome (especially with concurrent MAOI use)
- Allergic reactions
- Severe hypotension
- Cardiogenic shock



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to Melitracen or any component of the formulation
- Recent myocardial infarction
- Any degree of atrioventricular block or cardiac rhythm disorders
- Untreated narrow-angle glaucoma
- Concomitant use or within 14 days of discontinuing MAOIs
- Coma
- Blood disorders


## **Drug Interactions**

- MAOIs: Risk of serotonin syndrome and hypertensive crisis
- Alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants: Increased CNS depression
- Anticholinergic agents: Enhanced anticholinergic effects
- Adrenergic neuron blockers (e.g., guanethidine): Reduced antihypertensive effects
- Epinephrine and norepinephrine: Potentiates cardiovascular effects
- Levodopa: Reduced efficacy and increased cardiac side effects

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Not well-established. Use only if potential benefits outweigh the risks.  Risk of neonatal withdrawal symptoms if used near term.
- **Breastfeeding:** Melitracen is excreted in breast milk.  Use with caution, considering potential effects on the neonate.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine
- **Side Effects:** Dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, drowsiness, dizziness, tremor, insomnia. Serious side effects include cardiac arrhythmias and serotonin syndrome.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, recent MI, heart block, glaucoma, concurrent MAOI use.
- **Drug Interactions:** MAOIs, CNS depressants, anticholinergics, adrenergic blockers.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution; potential for fetal/neonatal effects.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 25 mg bid-tid up to 225 mg/day. Elderly: start with lower doses. Combination with flupentixol: 1 tablet bid, adjustable.
