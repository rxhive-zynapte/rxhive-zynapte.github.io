## **Usage**

- Melphalan is prescribed for the palliative treatment of multiple myeloma and nonresectable epithelial ovarian carcinoma. It is also used in high doses as a conditioning treatment prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma and other malignancies. It has been used in hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion for melanoma and soft tissue sarcoma.  It is also used to treat AL amyloidosis.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Alkylating antineoplastic agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Melphalan acts as a bifunctional alkylating agent, crosslinking DNA strands, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and RNA synthesis, which ultimately leads to cell death. Its action primarily targets rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells.

## **Alternate Names**

- Alkeran (brand name), L-PAM, L-phenylalanine mustard, phenylalanine mustard, L-sarcolysin.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Melphalan exerts its cytotoxic effect by alkylating DNA, which disrupts cell division and leads to apoptosis (programmed cell death) of malignant cells.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Oral absorption is variable and incomplete. IV administration bypasses absorption issues.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver to less active metabolites.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted primarily through the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:** Melphalan forms covalent bonds with DNA, primarily at the N7 position of guanine. This crosslinking prevents DNA replication and transcription, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** No specific receptor binding; acts directly on DNA.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion with some hepatic metabolism.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Multiple Myeloma (Oral):**
    - 6 mg orally once daily for 2-3 weeks, followed by a rest period of up to 4 weeks, or 0.15 mg/kg/day for 7 days followed by maintenance dosing of 2 mg daily or 0.05 mg/kg/day. May also be given in combination with other medications.
- **Multiple Myeloma (IV):** 16 mg/m² IV over 15-20 minutes every 2 weeks for 4 doses, then every 4 weeks. High-dose regimens (100-200 mg/m²) are used prior to stem cell transplantation.
- **Ovarian Cancer (Oral):** 0.2 mg/kg/day for 5 days, repeated every 4-5 weeks.

#### **Children:**

- Dosing is based on body surface area (BSA) and specific protocols, usually in conjunction with stem cell transplantation. Generally not indicated for standard treatment in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start at the lower end of the dosing range and monitor closely for myelosuppression and other toxicities.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce dosage based on the degree of impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments are typically recommended, but close monitoring is advised. 
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Adjust dosage based on individual patient factors.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Melphalan is primarily used for systemic chemotherapy and not typically for the specific medical settings listed below (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit [ICU] Use, Emergency Situations). For regional perfusion of the limbs in melanoma and sarcoma, please refer to the literature.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are based on hematologic toxicity, renal function, and other patient-specific factors.
