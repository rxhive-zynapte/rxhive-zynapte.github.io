## **Usage**

- Menadione, also known as Vitamin K3, is a synthetic form of Vitamin K. It's primarily indicated for the prevention and treatment of hypoprothrombinemia (a deficiency of prothrombin, a clotting factor) caused by Vitamin K deficiency.  It is also used in the prevention of anticoagulant-induced prothrombin deficiency.  It's crucial to remember that Menadione is not a nutritional supplement form of Vitamin K for humans due to potential toxicity.

- **Pharmacological classification:** Vitamin K analog, Hemostatic agent

- **Mechanism of action:** Menadione is a fat-soluble vitamin precursor. It's essential for the hepatic synthesis of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as anticoagulant proteins C and S.  It acts as a cofactor for the enzyme gamma-glutamyl carboxylase, which converts glutamic acid residues in precursor proteins into gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues. These Gla residues enable the clotting factors to bind calcium ions, which is necessary for their activation and participation in the coagulation cascade.


## **Alternate Names**

- Vitamin K3
- Menadione sodium bisulfite (water-soluble form)



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Menadione promotes blood clotting by facilitating the synthesis of essential clotting factors. Its effect is observed through a decrease in prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR), indicating improved coagulation.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Menadione is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and requires bile salts for optimal absorption. The water-soluble form (menadione sodium bisulfite) is administered parenterally and bypasses this requirement. It's primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted in bile and urine. The half-life is not clinically established.

- **Mode of action:** Menadione undergoes reduction to menaquinone, active form in the liver. It then serves as a cofactor for the gamma-glutamyl carboxylase enzyme, which carboxylates specific glutamic acid residues within the precursor molecules of clotting factors.

- **Receptor binding/enzyme inhibition:**  Menadione does not directly bind to receptors but acts as a cofactor for gamma-glutamyl carboxylase.

- **Elimination pathways:** Menadione is eliminated through hepatic metabolism and biliary/renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- For severe hypoprothrombinemia: 2.5-10 mg IM or IV daily. Oral administration: 10 mg 3-4 times/day.

#### **Children:**
- Infants (for vitamin K deficiency): 1-5 mcg/kg/day orally.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate therapy at the lower end of the dosing range.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised; dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised; dose adjustment may be necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- The provided sources do not offer dosage recommendations for the specified clinical scenarios (intubation, surgical procedures, etc.) for Menadione.  Its primary use is for Vitamin K deficiency. Consult hematology specialist for specific dosing guidance in these contexts.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modification might be necessary in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Monitor PT/INR and adjust doses accordingly.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Facial flushing
- Sweating
- Altered taste
- Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling)


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Hemolytic anemia (especially in newborns and patients with G6PD deficiency)
- Kernicterus (brain damage in newborns due to severe hyperbilirubinemia)
- Liver damage (with high doses or prolonged use)
- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)


### **Long-Term Effects**
- Liver and kidney damage (with prolonged high-dose therapy)


## **Contraindications**
- Hypersensitivity to Menadione or any components of the formulation
- Neonates (especially premature infants)
- G6PD deficiency
- Cholestatic liver disease


## **Drug Interactions**
- Anticoagulants (warfarin, coumarins): Menadione may reduce their effectiveness, increasing the risk of thromboembolic events.
- Orlistat: May decrease Menadione absorption.
- Drugs metabolized by the liver (anticonvulsants, antibiotics): Monitor for potential interactions.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Menadione is not recommended during pregnancy unless absolutely necessary due to potential risks to the fetus (hemolytic anemia, hyperbilirubinemia, kernicterus).
- Menadione use while breastfeeding is not recommended due to the unknown effects on the infant.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
