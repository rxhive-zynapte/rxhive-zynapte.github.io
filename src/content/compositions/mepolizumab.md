## **Usage**

Mepolizumab is prescribed as an add-on maintenance treatment for the following conditions:

* **Severe Eosinophilic Asthma:** In adults, adolescents, and children aged 6 years and older.
* **Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps (CRSwNP):** In adults with inadequate response to nasal corticosteroids.
* **Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA):** In adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older.
* **Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES):** In adults without an identifiable non-hematologic secondary cause.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Interleukin-5 (IL-5) antagonist monoclonal antibody.

**Mechanism of Action:** Mepolizumab binds to IL-5, a key cytokine responsible for the growth, differentiation, activation, and survival of eosinophils. By preventing IL-5 from binding to its receptor on the surface of eosinophils, mepolizumab reduces the production and survival of these cells. This leads to a decrease in eosinophil levels in the blood and tissues, mitigating inflammation and improving symptoms in eosinophilic-driven diseases.


## **Alternate Names**

Mepolizumab is the generic name.  A popular brand name is Nucala.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Mepolizumab reduces blood and tissue eosinophil levels, resulting in decreased airway inflammation and improved lung function in asthma, reduced nasal polyp size in CRSwNP, and controlled organ involvement in EGPA and HES.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Administered subcutaneously, with good bioavailability.
* **Metabolism:** Degraded by proteolytic enzymes found throughout the body, not specifically in the liver or kidneys.
* **Elimination:** Not renally or hepatically cleared. Elimination half-life is approximately 16-22 days.

**Mode of Action:** Binds directly to IL-5, preventing it from interacting with the IL-5 receptor alpha on the surface of eosinophils, thus inhibiting eosinophil activation and survival.

**Receptor Binding:** Specifically targets the IL-5 cytokine.

**Elimination Pathways:** Non-specific proteolytic degradation.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Severe Eosinophilic Asthma, CRSwNP:** 100 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks.
* **EGPA, HES:** 300 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks (administered as three separate 100 mg injections).

#### **Children:**

* **Severe Eosinophilic Asthma (6-11 years):** 40 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is typically required.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Close monitoring is advised, and dose adjustments may be necessary on a case-by-case basis.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Mepolizumab is not indicated for acute conditions like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  It is a *maintenance* treatment for chronic conditions.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific dose adjustments are recommended for renal or hepatic impairment. For other conditions, consult clinical guidelines and consider individual patient needs.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Headache
* Injection site reactions (pain, redness, itching)
* Back pain
* Fatigue


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm)
* Herpes zoster reactivation


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term effects are still being evaluated. Regular monitoring for potential complications is recommended.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any signs of hypersensitivity should be considered a serious ADR requiring immediate intervention.




## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to mepolizumab or any of its excipients.



## **Drug Interactions**

Limited data are available. Drug interactions via CYP450, efflux pumps, or protein binding are not expected. However, there is a theoretical risk of reduced efficacy with live vaccines. Consult clinical resources for updated information.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Limited data available.  While animal studies do not indicate reproductive toxicity, the potential risk to the fetus is unknown. Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk.  A pregnancy registry is available.

* **Breastfeeding:** Unknown if mepolizumab is excreted in human milk.  IgG is present in human milk, but the amount of mepolizumab, if any, is unknown.  A shared decision between the mother and healthcare provider is needed, weighing the benefits of breastfeeding against the potential risk to the infant.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** IL-5 antagonist monoclonal antibody that reduces eosinophil levels.
* **Side Effects:** Headache, injection site reactions, back pain, fatigue; rarely hypersensitivity.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to mepolizumab.
* **Drug Interactions:** Limited data available; minimal drug interactions expected.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Limited data, weigh benefit vs risk.
* **Dosage:** Varies based on indication and age; 100 mg q4w for adults (asthma, CRSwNP); 300mg q4w for adults (EGPA, HES); 40mg q4w for children (6-11 years) with asthma.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Eosinophil counts, asthma control, symptom improvement, adverse events.



## **Popular Combinations**

Mepolizumab is often used in combination with inhaled corticosteroids in severe eosinophilic asthma. Specific combination therapies should be based on individual patient needs and clinical guidelines.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Screen for allergies and relevant medical history before initiating treatment.
* **Specific Populations:**  As noted above, careful consideration of risks and benefits is needed for pregnant/breastfeeding women, children, and the elderly.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  No specific lifestyle restrictions are typically associated with mepolizumab.
