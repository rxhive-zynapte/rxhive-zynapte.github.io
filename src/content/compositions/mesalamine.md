      Are there different formulations of Mesalamine, and how do they differ?**


      **A:** Yes, mesalamine comes in various oral (tablets, capsules, granules)
      and rectal (suppositories, enemas) formulations.  The formulations are
      designed to release mesalamine in specific parts of the gastrointestinal
      tract to target the inflammation site effectively.  Different brands and
      formulations have varying release mechanisms (delayed-release,
      extended-release, pH-dependent release).

## **Usage**

Mesalamine is prescribed for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), primarily ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.  It belongs to the aminosalicylate classification and works by reducing inflammation in the intestinal lining.  Its mechanism of action is primarily topical, exerting its anti-inflammatory effects directly on the affected areas of the gut.

## **Alternate Names**

Mesalamine is also known as mesalazine (international nonproprietary name) or 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). Brand names for mesalamine include Asacol, Pentasa, Apriso, Lialda, Delzicol, Rowasa, and Canasa.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Mesalamine's primary action is anti-inflammatory, achieved by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase pathways, reducing the production of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes.  It also scavenges free radicals and may inhibit tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α).

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Mesalamine is available in oral and rectal formulations designed to release the drug throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Oral formulations are designed as delayed-release or extended-release to target specific areas of the intestine. Rectal formulations (suppositories and enemas) are used to treat distal colitis.  Absorption varies depending on the formulation and location of release within the GI tract.  It is metabolized in the intestinal wall and liver, primarily by N-acetylation to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid, and excreted in urine and feces. Elimination is primarily renal, with some hepatic excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Oral mesalamine dosage for adults typically ranges from 2.4 g to 4.8 g daily, administered in divided doses.  The specific dosage and formulation depend on the location and severity of the inflammation.  For maintenance of remission, lower doses may be sufficient.

#### **Children:**

Oral mesalamine is generally recommended for children older than 5 years.  Dosing is weight-based and should be determined by a physician. The typical dosage range is 27 to 71 mg/kg/day, divided into two doses, not exceeding the maximum daily limit (which varies by weight).  Rectal mesalamine can be considered for children over 12 years old, with dosing and administration guided by a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Dose adjustments are usually not necessary unless there is significant renal or hepatic impairment. Close monitoring for adverse effects is recommended.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Mesalamine should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Dose adjustments may be necessary based on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Mesalamine should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Dose adjustments may be necessary based on the severity of the impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments may be needed for patients with certain comorbid conditions, such as heart or lung disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Mesalamine's clinical use is mainly focused on IBD management. The use cases below relate to maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation, scenarios not directly related to Mesalamine's therapeutic indication:

* **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use/Emergency Situations:** Mesalamine does not have a direct role in these scenarios. The management of IBD in patients undergoing these procedures or in critical care settings requires careful consideration of the patient's IBD status and potential drug interactions.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on patient-specific factors such as renal or hepatic dysfunction, disease severity, and response to therapy.  Therapeutic drug monitoring can be helpful in optimizing the dose.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Headache, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence, dizziness, rash, flu-like symptoms (runny nose, sneezing, sore throat).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe allergic reactions, pancreatitis, pericarditis, nephritis, blood disorders (agranulocytosis, pancytopenia), worsening of colitis symptoms.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic kidney disease (rare), hair loss (rare), decreased male fertility (rare).


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Hypersensitivity reactions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug-induced lupus, myocarditis.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to mesalamine or salicylates, severe renal or hepatic impairment, pyloric stenosis, active peptic ulcer disease.


## **Drug Interactions**

Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, certain antacids, NSAIDs, warfarin, and other medications metabolized by CYP450 enzymes.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Mesalamine is generally considered safe during pregnancy (Pregnancy Category B or C, depending on the formulation).  Small amounts are excreted in breast milk. While generally considered safe, infants should be monitored for diarrhea.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits inflammatory pathways and scavenges free radicals in the intestinal mucosa.
* **Side Effects:** Headache, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, rash, rare serious reactions like blood disorders or nephritis.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to salicylates, severe renal/hepatic impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, NSAIDs, warfarin.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe, monitor infants for diarrhea during breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** 2.4-4.8 g/day for adults, weight-based for children.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Complete blood count, liver function tests, renal function tests (especially in children and patients with renal impairment).

## **Popular Combinations**

Mesalamine is often used in combination with other medications for IBD, such as corticosteroids or immunomodulators, for enhanced efficacy.

## **Precautions**

Monitor renal and hepatic function, particularly in patients with pre-existing impairment. Observe for signs of blood disorders or hypersensitivity reactions.  Caution is advised in patients with asthma or pulmonary disease.
