      How does Mesalazine differ from Sulfasalazine?**


      **A:** Both are aminosalicylates, but sulfasalazine contains a
      sulfapyridine component, which is responsible for many of its side
      effects.  Mesalazine lacks this component, leading to a better
      tolerability profile.

## **Usage**

Mesalazine is prescribed for the treatment of mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis (inflammation of the large intestine and rectum) and Crohn's disease. It is also used to maintain remission of these conditions.  Its pharmacological classification is anti-inflammatory, specifically an aminosalicylate. Mesalazine works by reducing inflammation in the intestinal tract, likely by inhibiting prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis.

## **Alternate Names**

Mesalazine is also known as mesalamine or 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). Brand names include Asacol, Pentasa, Lialda, Apriso, Delzicol, Rowasa, and others.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Mesalazine exerts its anti-inflammatory effects locally in the gut. The exact mechanism is unknown, but it is thought to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase, reducing the production of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and leukotrienes. It may also modulate inflammatory cytokines and immune cell function.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Absorption varies depending on the formulation.  Immediate-release mesalazine is absorbed extensively and rapidly, while modified-release formulations have lower and more localized absorption.  Mesalazine is rapidly metabolized in the colon wall and liver to N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (N-Ac-5-ASA).  Elimination is primarily through fecal excretion (72%), with some renal excretion (19-30%).

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral:**  For active ulcerative colitis: 2.4g to 4.8g daily, taken once daily or in divided doses. For maintenance of remission: 1.6g to 2.4g daily, once daily.
* **Rectal:**  1000 mg suppository or 4g enema once daily at bedtime.


#### **Children:**

Oral: 20-30mg/kg body weight daily, in divided doses. Dosage should be individualized based on age, weight, and disease severity. Use in children under 5 is not well established.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are usually necessary, but monitoring renal function is recommended.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. In severe renal impairment (GFR <30 ml/min), mesalazine is contraindicated. 
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Monitor liver function.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized dosing may be necessary.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Mesalazine is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary use is in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, or in those experiencing adverse effects.
