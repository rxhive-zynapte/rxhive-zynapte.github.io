## **Usage**

- Mesterolone is prescribed primarily for the treatment of male hypogonadism, a condition characterized by insufficient testosterone production. It is also used in cases of male infertility associated with low testosterone and delayed puberty in adolescent boys.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Androgen; Anabolic-Androgenic Steroid (AAS).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Mesterolone is an orally active synthetic androgen that binds to androgen receptors, mimicking the effects of natural testosterone.  It promotes the development and maintenance of male secondary sexual characteristics and stimulates spermatogenesis in some cases. Unlike testosterone, it is not significantly metabolized by 5-alpha reductase in the target tissues. 


## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional variations:** None explicitly stated.
- **Brand Names:** Proviron, Provironum


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Mesterolone binds to androgen receptors in target tissues, promoting the development and maintenance of male sexual characteristics.  It exerts a weaker anabolic effect compared to other AAS due to inactivation by 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD) in skeletal muscle. It does not aromatize to estrogen and exhibits some anti-estrogenic properties by competing with other steroids for aromatase binding.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Rapid and almost complete absorption after oral administration.
    - **Metabolism:** Rapidly metabolized in the liver, primarily to 1α-methylandrosterone and 1α-methyl-5α-androstane-3α, 17β-diol.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily via urine (80% as metabolites) and feces (13% as metabolites).
    - **Elimination Half-Life:** Approximately 12-13 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Binds to intracellular androgen receptors, leading to gene transcription and protein synthesis, mediating androgenic effects.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Androgen receptor agonist; weak aromatase inhibitor.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism with renal and fecal excretion of metabolites. Not a substrate for aromatase and is not 17α-alkylated, thus minimizing hepatotoxicity.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial: 25-50 mg two to three times a day (75-150 mg total daily dose) for several months.
- Maintenance: 25 mg two to three times a day (50-75 mg total daily dose).
- Male infertility: 50-100 mg per day for 90 days.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for use in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to increased risk of prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.  Dosage adjustments may be required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution, dosage adjustment may be needed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Generally well-tolerated, but use cautiously and monitor liver function tests.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, epilepsy, migraine, and diabetes.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Mesterolone is not typically indicated for use in acute clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its use is primarily for chronic androgen deficiency.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjust dosage based on patient response, tolerance, and clinical efficacy.
- Consider renal and hepatic function when determining the appropriate dosage.
