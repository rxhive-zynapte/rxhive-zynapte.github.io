## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Methdilazine is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of pruritus (itching) associated with various dermatoses (skin conditions) like urticaria (hives), eczema, and allergic reactions. It can also alleviate allergic symptoms like sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes associated with hay fever (allergic rhinitis). Additionally, it may be used to prevent and treat motion sickness and as a mild sedative for nausea, vomiting, and dizziness.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Methdilazine is classified as a first-generation phenothiazine antihistamine with anticholinergic properties.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Methdilazine primarily acts as an H1 receptor antagonist, blocking the action of histamine, a chemical mediator responsible for allergic symptoms.  Its anticholinergic properties contribute to its efficacy in treating motion sickness by inhibiting muscarinic receptors in the brain's vomiting center.


## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Other Brands:** Dilosyn, Tacaryl, Anergan, Antinaus, Histantil, Panectyl, Pentazine, Phenazine, Phencen, Phenergan, Phenerzine, Phenoject, Pro-Med, Promacot, Promet, Prorex, Prothazine, Shogan, Tacazyl, Tacryl, Temaril, V-Gan-25.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Methdilazine binds to H1 receptors, preventing histamine from binding and exerting its effects like itching, vasodilation, and increased mucus production.  Its anticholinergic action inhibits the effects of acetylcholine, reducing smooth muscle contractions and glandular secretions.  It also crosses the blood-brain barrier, resulting in sedative effects.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Methdilazine is well-absorbed after oral administration.
    - **Metabolism:**  Primarily metabolized in the liver.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted primarily through the kidneys and bile.

- **Mode of Action:** Competitive antagonism at histamine H1 receptors and muscarinic receptors.

- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Binds to H1 and muscarinic receptors.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 8-16 mg orally, two to four times daily.


#### **Children:**

- Dosage is based on the child's weight and age and should be determined by a physician. Typically lower than adult doses.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Start with the lowest dose and increase cautiously as needed, monitoring for side effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment is necessary in patients with severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised; dose adjustment may be required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, cardiovascular disease, asthma, or other respiratory disorders. Close monitoring and dose adjustment may be needed.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Specific dosage recommendations for clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations are not well-established and should be determined by a physician based on the individual patient's needs.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and patients with certain comorbid conditions. Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism should be considered.
