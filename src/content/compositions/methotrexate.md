      What is the mechanism of action of Methotrexate in cancer treatment?**


      **A:** At high doses, methotrexate exerts its anti-cancer effects
      primarily through inhibition of DHFR, which leads to the disruption of
      DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis in rapidly dividing cancer cells. 
      Leucovorin rescue is often used to minimize toxicity to normal cells.

## **Usage**

Methotrexate is prescribed for various medical conditions, including:

*   Certain cancers such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,  gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, and  osteosarcoma.
*   Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis,  psoriasis,  psoriatic arthritis, and Crohn's disease.
*   Ectopic pregnancy.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Antimetabolite, antineoplastic, immunosuppressant, antifolate.

**Mechanism of Action:** Methotrexate primarily inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme crucial for folate metabolism. This inhibition blocks DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, impacting rapidly dividing cells like cancer cells and immune cells.  It also has anti-inflammatory properties.

## **Alternate Names**

*   Amethopterin
*   4-amino-10-methylfolic acid


**Brand Names:**  Examples include Trexall, Otrexup, Jylamvo, Maxtrex, Methofill, Metoject, Nordimet, Zlatal.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Methotrexate's primary effect is the inhibition of cell proliferation. In cancer, this leads to tumor regression; in autoimmune diseases, it dampens the overactive immune response.  At higher doses used in cancer treatment, it has cytotoxic effects. At lower doses employed for inflammatory conditions, its immunosuppressant and anti-inflammatory effects predominate.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Oral absorption is variable and dose-dependent, decreasing at higher doses.  Subcutaneous and intramuscular routes provide more consistent absorption. Intrathecal administration bypasses the blood-brain barrier for CNS conditions.
*   **Metabolism:**  Partially metabolized in the liver, primarily by aldehyde oxidase, to inactive metabolites and polyglutamates, some of which also possess antifolate activity.
*   **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion. Dosage adjustment is necessary for renal impairment.

**Mode of Action:**  Methotrexate competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), ultimately halting thymidylate and purine nucleotide synthesis.  Polyglutamation of methotrexate within cells results in prolonged intracellular retention and enhanced inhibition of other folate-dependent enzymes.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Methotrexate's main mechanism involves DHFR inhibition.  It also inhibits other folate-dependent enzymes, including thymidylate synthase, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase, and AICAR transformylase.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion, with a small portion excreted in bile.  Polyglutamated forms may undergo enterohepatic recirculation, contributing to prolonged effects.


## **Dosage**

Dosage varies significantly depending on the condition, route of administration, and patient-specific factors.  It is crucial to individualize the dosage based on careful assessment and close monitoring.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** Starting dose is usually 7.5 mg orally once weekly, which can be gradually increased up to a maximum of 20-25 mg weekly, based on response and tolerance.
*   **Psoriasis:** Starting dose ranges from 10-25 mg orally once weekly, which may be adjusted to a maximum of 30 mg weekly.
*   **Crohn's disease:**  Maintenance dose is typically 10-25 mg orally once weekly.

#### **Children:**

*   **Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (pJIA):** Starting dose is often 10 mg/m² orally once weekly, titrated based on response and tolerance up to a maximum of 30 mg/m² weekly. 
*   Other conditions: Dosage calculations based on body surface area (BSA) are common in pediatrics and must be determined by a doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Start at lower doses and monitor closely for adverse reactions.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage reduction is necessary based on creatinine clearance.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Close monitoring and dosage adjustment are essential.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized dosing and careful consideration of potential drug interactions are required.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Methotrexate's use in scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations primarily relates to its role in managing underlying conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease during these critical periods.  Dosage modifications during these times often depend on the patient's stability and the impact of the acute situation on their overall health. Its use in high-dose chemotherapy regimens requires careful consideration and specific protocols, often including leucovorin rescue.  For instance, acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment might involve high-dose methotrexate followed by leucovorin.  Dosing in such cases needs to be tailored to the individual and disease protocol.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage modifications are based on patient response, renal and hepatic function, concomitant medications, and potential drug interactions.  Therapeutic drug monitoring and assessment of relevant laboratory parameters are essential.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhea, fatigue, alopecia, headache, myelosuppression (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia).


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**  Hepatotoxicity, pulmonary fibrosis, nephrotoxicity, opportunistic infections, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis.

### **Long-Term Effects:**  Liver cirrhosis, bone marrow suppression, infertility.
