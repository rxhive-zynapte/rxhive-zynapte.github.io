## **Usage**

- Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta is prescribed for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults and children aged 5-17 years on hemodialysis converting from another erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA).
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA).
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta stimulates erythropoiesis by interacting with erythropoietin receptors on progenitor cells in the bone marrow. This interaction promotes the proliferation and differentiation of erythroid precursor cells, leading to increased red blood cell production.

## **Alternate Names**

-  Mircera
-  Pegzerepoetin alfa
-  CERA


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta increases hemoglobin levels and red blood cell counts. It reduces the need for red blood cell transfusions in patients with CKD.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** After subcutaneous administration, absolute bioavailability is approximately 54% in patients not on dialysis and 62% in patients on dialysis.
    - **Metabolism:**  Limited information is available on the metabolism of methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta. However, being analogous to erythropoietin, it is believed to undergo catabolism within the cells of the reticuloendothelial system and kidneys after binding to erythropoietin receptors.
    - **Elimination:** The terminal elimination half-life is approximately 139-142 hours. It is presumably excreted via the kidneys, although detailed elimination pathways are not fully characterized.
- **Mode of Action:** Binds to erythropoietin receptors on erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow, stimulating their proliferation and differentiation, ultimately increasing red blood cell production.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Binds to erythropoietin receptors.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily renal excretion. However, since this drug is a complex molecule with a PEG chain, the exact mechanism of elimination and its distribution in the body requires further research.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **CKD not on dialysis:** 1.2 mcg/kg subcutaneously once monthly.
- **CKD on dialysis:** Initial dose of 0.6 mcg/kg intravenously or subcutaneously every 2 weeks. Once hemoglobin is stabilized, administer dose once monthly using a dose that is twice that of every-two-week dose. Further titration as needed.

#### **Children:**

- 5-17 years on hemodialysis converting from another ESA: Dose depends on total weekly ESA dose; administer intravenously every 4 weeks. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 5 years converting from an ESA, children not converting from another ESA, or children not on hemodialysis.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are required, as described above.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No information on dose adjustments is available. Use with caution.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or history of seizures.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations is not specifically provided in the source material.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments may be required based on hemoglobin response, iron status, and other factors.
- Renal impairment necessitates dose adjustments, as outlined above. Limited information is available on dose adjustments for hepatic dysfunction or genetic polymorphisms.
