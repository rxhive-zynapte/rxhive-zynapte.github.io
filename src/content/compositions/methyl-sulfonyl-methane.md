## **Usage**

- Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is primarily used for osteoarthritis, potentially reducing pain, swelling, and improving joint function.  It is also used for other conditions like allergic rhinitis, interstitial cystitis, muscle soreness after exercise, and skin conditions such as rosacea and scar tissue, although more research is needed to confirm these uses.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Dietary supplement, sometimes classified as a "nutraceutical."  It doesn't fit neatly into traditional drug classifications like analgesics or anti-inflammatories, although it exhibits some effects similar to these categories.
- **Mechanism of Action:** The precise mechanism isn't fully understood. It is thought to contribute to the formation of collagen and glucosamine, crucial for joint health.  It also possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, possibly influencing immune responses and reducing oxidative stress.

## **Alternate Names**

- Dimethyl sulfone (DMSO2)
- Crystalline DMSO (Note:  While sometimes called crystalline DMSO, MSM is distinct from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).)
- Brand names: OptiMSM®, Triflex®, Osteo BiFlex® (often in combination with other supplements)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** MSM may reduce inflammation by modulating cytokine activity and inhibiting NF-κB pathways.  Its antioxidant effects are attributed to scavenging free radicals and increasing glutathione levels.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  MSM is readily absorbed orally and distributes throughout the body, crossing the blood-brain barrier. It's metabolized to methylsulfonylmethane sulfoxide and sulfate and primarily excreted in urine.
- **Mode of Action (Cellular/Molecular):**  Contributes sulfur for the synthesis of crucial structural components like collagen and glycosaminoglycans. Exact receptor binding, enzyme interactions, or neurotransmitter modulation aren't fully elucidated.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly renal excretion, with some hepatic metabolism.  Specific CYP enzyme involvement is unknown.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Osteoarthritis:** 2 to 6 grams daily, divided into 2-3 doses, taken with meals. Treatment typically continues for 6 to 12 weeks.
- **Allergic Rhinitis:** 2.6 grams as a single dose or 3 grams daily for 4-6 weeks.
- **Other conditions:** Dosages vary, usually within the range of 1 to 6 grams daily.

#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy not established.  Consult a pediatrician before considering MSM for children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments, but start with a lower dose and monitor closely.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No specific guidelines, but caution advised due to renal excretion. Monitor renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific adjustments, but caution is recommended.  Monitor liver function.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  No specific adjustments for conditions like diabetes or cardiovascular disease, but individualized assessment is crucial.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations:**  No established dosages or recommendations for these clinical settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
