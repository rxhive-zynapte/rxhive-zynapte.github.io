## **Usage**

Methylcellulose is primarily prescribed for the treatment of constipation and to promote regular bowel movements. It is classified as a bulk-forming laxative. It works by absorbing water in the intestines, which increases stool bulk and softens its consistency, thereby facilitating easier passage.

## **Alternate Names**

Methylcellulose is also known by various brand names, including Citrucel, Citrucel SF, Citrucel Food Pack, Citrucel Clear Mix, Citrucel Lax, and Foster and Thrive Fiber Laxative.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Methylcellulose exerts its laxative effect by absorbing water in the intestinal tract, increasing fecal mass and promoting peristalsis. This leads to softer, bulkier stools that are easier to pass.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Methylcellulose is not absorbed systemically. It remains within the intestinal lumen where it absorbs water and forms a viscous gel. It is eventually eliminated from the body through the feces. The onset of action is typically 12-72 hours.

**Mode of Action:** As a bulk-forming agent, methylcellulose does not bind to receptors, inhibit enzymes, or modulate neurotransmitters. Its action is primarily physical, based on its water-absorbing properties within the gut.

**Elimination:** Methylcellulose is eliminated via fecal excretion.  It is not metabolized by CYP enzymes.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard dose is 2 tablets (1000 mg) or 1 heaping tablespoon (19 g) of powder with 8 oz of liquid, taken up to six times per day. The maximum daily dose is 12 tablets or 3 tablespoons of powder.

#### **Children:**

* **6-12 years:**  1 tablet (500 mg) or ½ to 1 tablespoon (5-10g) powder with 8 oz of liquid, up to six times daily. The maximum is 6 tablets. Pediatric safety considerations emphasize the importance of adequate fluid intake to avoid choking.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments are usually not required, but monitor for adequate hydration.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments may not be necessary as methylcellulose isn't systemically absorbed.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor patients with irritable bowel syndrome for possible exacerbations.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Methylcellulose is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, the ICU, or emergency situations. Its primary use is for managing constipation and promoting regularity.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are not routinely made based on renal or hepatic function, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms. Adequate hydration is vital to prevent esophageal or intestinal obstruction.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Flatulence
* Abdominal cramping
* Bloating

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Allergic reactions (hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Fecal impaction (especially with inadequate fluid intake)
* Esophageal obstruction or intestinal blockage
* Rectal bleeding

### **Long-Term Effects**

No significant long-term side effects have been reported.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions and intestinal obstruction are ADRs requiring urgent medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to methylcellulose
* Known or suspected bowel obstruction, appendicitis, acute surgical abdomen
* GI ulceration or adhesions
* Fecal impaction
* Dysphagia
* Rectal bleeding

## **Drug Interactions**

Methylcellulose can decrease the absorption of other medications taken orally.  It is advisable to administer other oral drugs at least 2 hours before or after methylcellulose. Clinically significant interactions with commonly prescribed medications, OTC drugs, supplements, or food (except potential interference with medication absorption) are not commonly reported.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Methylcellulose is not absorbed systemically and is considered unlikely to pose a risk to the fetus or breastfed infant. However, consult with a doctor before use during pregnancy or breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Bulk-forming laxative that increases stool mass and water content, promoting peristalsis.
* **Side Effects:** Flatulence, abdominal cramping, bloating; rarely, allergic reactions, fecal impaction, obstruction.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, bowel obstruction, GI issues, dysphagia, fecal impaction, rectal bleeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** May reduce absorption of other orally administered medications.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally considered safe but consult a physician before use.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 2 tablets or 1 tbsp up to 6 times/day (max 12 tablets/day); Children (6-12): 1 tablet or ½-1 tbsp up to 6 times/day.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor bowel movements and hydration status.

## **Popular Combinations**

Methylcellulose is not typically used in combination with other drugs for synergistic effects.


## **Precautions**

* Ensure adequate fluid intake to prevent choking and esophageal or intestinal obstruction.
* Monitor patients with pre-existing GI conditions.
* Be aware of potential allergic reactions.
