## **Usage**

- Methylcobalamin, a naturally occurring and active form of Vitamin B12, is primarily prescribed for the treatment of Vitamin B12 deficiency and associated neurological conditions, such as peripheral neuropathy.  It is also used to manage diabetic neuropathy and other neuropathies.  Some studies suggest its use in improving sperm count and motility, and in reversing neuropsychiatric symptoms, although more research is needed in these areas.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Vitamin,  hematopoietic, neurotrophic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Methylcobalamin acts as a coenzyme in various metabolic processes, crucial for DNA synthesis, red blood cell production, and nerve cell maintenance.  It plays a critical role in the formation of myelin, the protective sheath around nerve fibers.  It also participates in the conversion of homocysteine to methionine, reducing potentially harmful homocysteine levels.

## **Alternate Names**

- Mecobalamin, MeB12, MeCbl, Cobalamin, Vitamin B12.
- **Brand Names:** Methyl B-12, Vitamin B12 Methylcobalamin, Methycobal, Neurocobal.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Methylcobalamin promotes DNA synthesis, red blood cell formation, and nerve cell maintenance by acting as a coenzyme for methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. It facilitates the conversion of homocysteine to methionine and methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. These actions are essential for normal hematopoiesis and neuronal function.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Actively absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, enhanced by intrinsic factor.
    - **Distribution:** Distributed widely in the body, crosses the placenta, and enters breast milk. Primarily bound to transcobalamins.
    - **Metabolism:** Undergoes extensive enterohepatic recycling.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted primarily in urine with a half-life varying based on administration route (oral: ~12.5 hours, injection: ~27-29 hours).
- **Mode of Action:** Methylcobalamin acts as a coenzyme for methionine synthase in the cytoplasm and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in the mitochondria.  It is involved in the synthesis of myelin, methylation reactions, and DNA synthesis. It promotes nerve cell growth and replication.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** It acts as a coenzyme for methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase rather than binding to receptors or inhibiting enzymes directly.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Oral:** 500 mcg three times daily for peripheral neuropathy and megaloblastic anemia due to B12 deficiency.  Dosages can range from 1500-6000 mcg/day, though doses exceeding 6000 mcg offer no additional benefit.
- **Intramuscular/Intravenous:** 500 mcg three times weekly for peripheral neuropathy.  For megaloblastic anemia, 500 mcg three times weekly for two months, followed by a maintenance dose of 500 mcg every 1-3 months.

#### **Children:**

- **Sublingual Spray:**
    - <1 year: 500 mcg/day
    - ≥1 year: 1000 mcg/day
- Administer daily for the first week and then every other day for seven weeks for nutritional B12 deficiency.  Doses may be adjusted depending on age and severity of symptoms.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Standard adult doses are generally recommended, but close monitoring for adverse effects is advisable.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment. Monitor renal function regularly.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution is advised. Monitor liver function regularly.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Individualized dosing based on the specific condition.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources primarily discuss Methylcobalamin usage in the context of Vitamin B12 deficiency and associated neurological conditions.  Dosage recommendations for specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations are not explicitly covered.  Such usage should be based on specific patient needs and clinical judgment.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, other underlying medical conditions, or interacting medications.  Consultation with a specialist is recommended for optimal dose adjustment.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, headache, and GI discomfort.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, hives, swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat, difficulty breathing),  liver toxicity (elevated liver enzymes),  fluid retention (swelling in legs, sudden weight gain).

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term adverse effects are rare with appropriate usage.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs requiring immediate intervention include severe allergic reactions, liver toxicity, and anemia.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to methylcobalamin or cobalt.
- Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy.

## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP450 Interactions:**  Not a substrate of CYP450 enzymes.
- **Other Interactions:**
    - Medications that reduce stomach acid (e.g., proton pump inhibitors, H2 blockers): May decrease B12 absorption.
    - Metformin: May reduce B12 absorption.
    - Chloramphenicol: May interfere with the hematological response to B12.
    - Colchicine, aminosalicylic acid, neomycin: May reduce absorption.
    - Oral contraceptives: May decrease serum B12 levels.
    - Alcohol: May impair absorption.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** A (generally considered safe at recommended doses). Adequate B12 levels are crucial during pregnancy.
- **Fetal Risks:**  B12 deficiency during pregnancy can cause neural tube defects and other developmental problems.
- **Breastfeeding:** B12 is excreted in breast milk.  Supplementation is recommended to maintain adequate levels in both mother and infant.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Coenzyme involved in DNA synthesis, red blood cell production, and nerve cell maintenance.
- **Side Effects:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, allergic reactions (rare).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to methylcobalamin or cobalt, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy.
- **Drug Interactions:** Medications affecting stomach acid, metformin, chloramphenicol.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Safe at recommended doses.

## **Popular Combinations**

Methylcobalamin is sometimes combined with other B vitamins, especially folate (B9) and pyridoxine (B6), particularly for managing neuropathic pain.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Evaluate for pre-existing allergies, liver disease, or kidney disease.
- **Specific Populations:** As mentioned earlier, pregnant and breastfeeding women require adequate intake.  Pediatric and geriatric dosages may need adjustments.
