## **Usage**

- Methyldopa is primarily prescribed for the treatment of **hypertension (high blood pressure)**, especially in patients who are pregnant or have chronic kidney disease. It is considered safe to use during all trimesters of pregnancy and during breastfeeding. However, it is no longer a first-line treatment for most other patients with hypertension.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Centrally acting antihypertensive, adrenergic receptor agonist (specifically, alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Methyldopa is converted to alpha-methylnorepinephrine in the central nervous system.  Alpha-methylnorepinephrine stimulates central alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, leading to a decrease in sympathetic outflow, reduced peripheral vascular resistance, and lowered blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Methyldopa
- **Other Names:**  Methyldopate hydrochloride (IV formulation)
- **Brand Name:** Aldomet

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Methyldopa lowers blood pressure by decreasing peripheral vascular resistance while having little effect on heart rate or cardiac output. It does not usually reduce glomerular filtration rate or renal blood flow. It has sedative effects related to its central mechanism of action.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Methyldopa is well-absorbed orally. Peak plasma concentrations occur in 3-6 hours.
    - **Metabolism:** It is extensively metabolized in the liver. The active metabolite, alpha-methylnorepinephrine, is responsible for its antihypertensive effect.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily excreted in the urine, both as unchanged drug and metabolites. The elimination half-life is about 2 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Methyldopa's metabolite, alpha-methylnorepinephrine, acts as an agonist at central alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the brainstem. Stimulation of these receptors inhibits sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system to the heart and blood vessels.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, reduces sympathetic outflow.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Initial:** 250 mg orally 2-3 times a day for the first 48 hours.
- **Maintenance:** 500 mg to 2 g orally daily, divided into 2-4 doses.
- **Maximum:** 3 g orally daily.

#### **Children:**

- **Initial:** 10 mg/kg orally daily, divided into 2-4 doses.
- **Maximum:** 65 mg/kg or 3 g daily, whichever is less.
- **Pediatric Safety Considerations:**  Monitor for hypotension and sedation.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose (e.g., 125 mg twice daily) and titrate slowly. Maximum dose: 2 g/day. Monitor closely for syncope.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Adjust dosage frequency based on creatinine clearance (CrCl). CrCl < 15 mL/min: every 12-24 hours. CrCl 15-50 mL/min: every 8-12 hours.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in active hepatic disease. Use with caution in patients with a history of liver problems.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with severe cerebrovascular disease, depression, or those undergoing surgery.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation:** No specific dosage adjustments.
- **Surgical Procedures:**  May require dosage adjustments of concomitant antihypertensive agents.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** No specific dosage adjustments.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** No specific dosage adjustments.
- **Emergency Situations:**  Hypertensive emergency: 250-500 mg IV every 6 hours up to a maximum of 1 g every 6 hours or 4 g/day. Switch to oral administration once blood pressure is controlled.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
