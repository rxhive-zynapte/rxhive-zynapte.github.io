## **Usage**

Methylene blue is prescribed for the treatment of acquired methemoglobinemia in both pediatric and adult patients.  It is also used in the treatment of ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy, vasoplegic syndrome, and cyanide poisoning. Additionally, it finds application in diagnostic procedures like sentinel lymph node biopsy, fistula detection, and parathyroid gland identification during surgery.

It can be classified as an antidote, a diagnostic aid, and depending on the application, other classifications may also be accurate.

Its mechanism of action primarily involves the reduction of methemoglobin (MetHb) to hemoglobin, restoring the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.

## **Alternate Names**

Methylene blue is also known as methylthioninium chloride. Some brand names include PROVAYBLUE, PROVEBLUE, and Urolene Blue.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Methylene blue acts as an oxidation-reduction agent. After intravenous administration, it enters red blood cells and undergoes reduction to leucomethylene blue.  Leucomethylene blue then reduces methemoglobin (MetHb), which contains ferric iron (Fe3+), back to hemoglobin, containing ferrous iron (Fe2+), thereby restoring the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. At higher doses, it can paradoxically oxidize hemoglobin to methemoglobin.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Methylene blue is administered intravenously, orally, or intra-amniotically (although this route is contraindicated due to serious risks).  It is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. It is extensively metabolized in the liver, and approximately 40% is excreted in the urine, primarily as leucomethylene blue. The half-life is around 5 hours, but it can be prolonged in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

**Mode of Action:** Methylene blue's mode of action at the cellular level involves a non-enzymatic redox reaction. Inside red blood cells, NADPH methemoglobin reductase converts methylene blue to leucomethylene blue. Leucomethylene blue then reduces the ferric iron (Fe3+) in methemoglobin to ferrous iron (Fe2+) in hemoglobin.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** While methylene blue's primary action doesn't involve receptor binding, it does inhibit monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A).  This MAOI activity contributes to the risk of serotonin syndrome when combined with serotonergic drugs.  It also inhibits nitric oxide synthase, contributing to its effects in vasoplegic syndrome.

**Elimination Pathways:** Methylene blue is primarily eliminated via renal excretion (approximately 40%), with the remaining amount excreted through other routes, including biliary excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Methemoglobinemia:** 1-2 mg/kg IV over 5-30 minutes. A repeat dose of up to 1 mg/kg may be given after one hour if MetHb levels remain above 30% or symptoms persist. Maximum dose: 7 mg/kg.

#### **Children:**

* **Methemoglobinemia:** 1-2 mg/kg IV over 5-30 minutes.  A repeat dose may be given after one hour if needed. Maximum dose: 7 mg/kg. Not recommended for infants under 4 months of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dose adjustment is mentioned in current literature, but caution is advised due to potential age-related decline in organ function. Monitor renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in patients with severe renal impairment. Dose reduction may be considered.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Monitor closely for toxicity and drug interactions due to potential delayed clearance.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised for patients with G6PD deficiency due to the risk of hemolytic anemia. Methylene blue is contraindicated in these patients.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:** Dosages are adjusted based on the specific clinical situation and the indication for methylene blue.
* **Emergency Situations (e.g., cyanide poisoning):** Specific protocols exist and should be followed.

### **Dosage Adjustments:** Dose adjustments might be necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, as well as for those taking interacting medications.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Blue-green discoloration of urine and feces
* Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain
* Dizziness, headache
* Profuse sweating

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Serotonin syndrome (when combined with serotonergic drugs)
* Hemolytic anemia (especially in patients with G6PD deficiency)
* Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis
* Seizures
* Hypotension

### **Long-Term Effects:**  Long-term effects are not well-studied, but chronic use may lead to anemia.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** Serotonin syndrome and severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

* Known hypersensitivity to methylene blue or thiazine dyes
* G6PD deficiency
* Pregnancy (except in life-threatening situations)
* Severe renal impairment

## **Drug Interactions**

Methylene blue interacts with a large number of medications.  Clinically significant interactions include:

* **Serotonergic drugs (SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs, TCAs):** Increased risk of serotonin syndrome.
* **CYP450 substrates:** Methylene blue inhibits various CYP enzymes and can affect the metabolism of other drugs.
* **Other:**  Interactions with other medications, such as those metabolized by CYP enzymes, require careful consideration and potential dose adjustments.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Methylene blue is contraindicated in pregnancy except in life-threatening situations.  It is classified as FDA Pregnancy Category X.  It can cause fetal harm, including intestinal atresia and fetal death.

It is unknown if methylene blue is excreted in breast milk.  Breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment and for up to 8 days after the last dose.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Reduces methemoglobin to hemoglobin.
