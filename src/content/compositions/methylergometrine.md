## **Usage**

Methylergometrine is prescribed for the prevention and control of postpartum hemorrhage (excessive bleeding after childbirth) caused by uterine atony (failure of the uterus to contract adequately).  It belongs to the pharmacological classification of ergot alkaloids and is categorized as an oxytocic or uterotonic agent.

Methylergometrine works by stimulating smooth muscle contraction in the uterus. This increases the tone, rate, and strength of uterine contractions, helping to constrict blood vessels and reduce bleeding.

## **Alternate Names**

Methylergometrine is also known as methylergonovine. A common brand name is Methergine.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Methylergometrine directly stimulates uterine smooth muscle, leading to strong, sustained contractions. It also exhibits some vasoconstrictive properties on peripheral blood vessels.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Methylergometrine is rapidly absorbed following intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) administration, and well-absorbed orally.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver.
* **Elimination:** Excreted mainly through the biliary system (feces) with some renal excretion. The elimination half-life is approximately 2-3 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Methylergometrine acts as a partial agonist at alpha-adrenergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic receptors. Its primary effect on uterine smooth muscle is attributed to its action on serotonin (5-HT2) receptors, causing strong, sustained contractions.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion, with some renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral:** 0.2 mg every 6-8 hours for up to 1 week postpartum.
* **IM:** 0.2 mg after delivery of the anterior shoulder, placenta, or during the postpartum period.  May be repeated every 2-4 hours as needed, not to exceed 5 doses.
* **IV:** 0.2 mg administered slowly over at least 60 seconds, only in emergencies due to risk of hypertension and stroke.

#### **Children:** Use and dose must be determined by a doctor. Pediatric safety and efficacy haven't been firmly established.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to potential age-related decline in organ function. Dose adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dose reduction may be needed.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dose reduction may be needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with hypertension, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, sepsis, and pre-eclampsia.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Methylergometrine's primary clinical use is for the prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage due to uterine atony. It's not generally indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use outside the context of postpartum care. In emergency situations of postpartum hemorrhage unresponsive to other measures, IV administration may be life-saving.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are required based on patient-specific factors such as renal or hepatic impairment, comorbid conditions, and other medications.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, diarrhea, increased sweating, unpleasant taste in mouth, tinnitus (ringing in ears), stuffy nose.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Hypertension, stroke, seizures, myocardial infarction, coronary artery spasm, shortness of breath, chest pain, allergic reactions (rash, itching, hives, swelling), peripheral vasoconstriction (cold hands/feet, pain/redness/swelling of limbs).

### **Long-Term Effects**

Ergotism (with prolonged use), pleural fibrosis, retroperitoneal fibrosis.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction, seizures, anaphylaxis.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to methylergometrine or other ergot alkaloids; pregnancy; pre-eclampsia or eclampsia; hypertension; severe hepatic or renal impairment; sepsis; coronary artery disease; peripheral vascular disease.

## **Drug Interactions**

Methylergometrine interacts with numerous medications, including:

* **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** (e.g., azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics, HIV protease inhibitors) increase methylergometrine levels.
* **Vasoconstrictors:** (e.g., other ergot alkaloids, sympathomimetics, triptans) enhance vasoconstricting effects and increase hypertension risk.
* **Other Uterotonics:** (e.g., oxytocin, prostaglandins) additive effects can increase risk of uterine rupture.
* **Beta-blockers:**  may enhance vasoconstriction.

Interactions also exist with certain antidepressants, antifungals, antihypertensives, and medications for migraine headaches. Alcohol, smoking, and grapefruit juice may affect drug metabolism.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (IM/IV/Oral).  Contraindicated during pregnancy.  Use only after delivery of the baby.

**Fetal Risks:** Uterine contractions can lead to fetal distress or demise if administered during pregnancy.

**Breastfeeding:** Avoid breastfeeding for at least 12 hours after the last dose.  Drug is excreted in breast milk and may cause adverse effects in infants.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Stimulates uterine contraction and vasoconstriction.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, headache, hypertension, stroke (rare).
* **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, hypertension, pre-eclampsia.
* **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors, vasoconstrictors, other uterotonics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy. Avoid breastfeeding for 12 hours post-dose.
* **Dosage:** 0.2 mg IM/IV/oral; dosage varies postpartum.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, heart rate, uterine response, vaginal bleeding.

## **Popular Combinations**

Methylergometrine is sometimes used in combination with oxytocin for postpartum hemorrhage but this practice is not recommended as it can increase the risk of hypertension.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Monitor blood pressure and uterine response closely.  Screen for pre-existing medical conditions.
* **Specific Populations:**  Contraindicated in pregnancy. Avoid breastfeeding for 12 hours post-dose. Use cautiously in the elderly and those with renal/hepatic impairment.
