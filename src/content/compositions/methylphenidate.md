## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Methylphenidate is primarily prescribed for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy.  It may also be used off-label for treatment-resistant depression, particularly in geriatric patients.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Central nervous system (CNS) stimulant.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Methylphenidate blocks the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine into presynaptic neurons, increasing their concentrations in the synaptic cleft and enhancing neurotransmission in the brain.

## **Alternate Names**

- **Alternate Names/Regional Variations:**  Methylphenidate hydrochloride.
- **Brand Names:** Ritalin, Concerta, Metadate, Methylin, Daytrana, Quillivant XR, Aptensio XR, Jornay PM.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Methylphenidate's primary effect is to increase the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, leading to improved attention, focus, and wakefulness. It also affects other neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, to a lesser extent.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations reached in 1-3 hours for immediate-release formulations and 4-7 hours for extended-release formulations. Food can delay absorption but does not significantly affect bioavailability. The transdermal patch (Daytrana) provides a slower, more sustained release over 9 hours.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver by carboxylesterase 1 to ritalinic acid, an inactive metabolite.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily excreted in the urine as ritalinic acid, with a half-life of 2-3 hours for immediate-release and 3-8 hours for extended-release formulations.

- **Mode of Action:** Methylphenidate blocks the dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET), preventing the reuptake of these neurotransmitters into presynaptic neurons. This increases their concentration in the synaptic cleft, thereby enhancing dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex and other brain regions involved in attention, executive function, and arousal.

- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Methylphenidate primarily acts by inhibiting DAT and NET. It has negligible affinity for other receptors or enzymes.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of ritalinic acid.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (ADHD):**

- **Immediate-Release:** 5-10 mg orally two to three times a day, 30-45 minutes before meals.  Maximum dose: 60 mg/day.
- **Extended-Release:** 18-36 mg orally once daily in the morning. Maximum dose: 72 mg/day.

#### **Adults (Narcolepsy):**

- **Immediate-Release:** 10-60 mg/day in divided doses.
- **Extended-Release:**  Dosage as per individual response and tolerability.

#### **Children (ADHD, 6 years and older):**

- **Immediate-Release:**  Starting dose: 5 mg orally twice daily before breakfast and lunch. Increase by 5-10 mg weekly. Maximum dose: 60 mg/day.
- **Extended-Release:**  Starting dose: 18 mg orally once daily. Increase by 18 mg weekly as needed. Maximum dose: 54 mg/day (children 6-12 years) or 72 mg/day (adolescents 13-17 years).

#### **Children (ADHD, younger than 6 years):**

- Dosage must be determined by the doctor.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Lower starting doses are recommended (e.g., 10-20 mg/day), with careful titration based on response and tolerability due to increased sensitivity to cardiovascular and neurotoxic effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustments may be necessary. Monitor closely.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments may be necessary due to reduced metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider potential interactions and adjust dosage accordingly. Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, anxiety, or glaucoma.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Methylphenidate is not typically indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest. Its primary clinical uses are ADHD and narcolepsy management.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments should be individualized based on patient response, tolerability, and the presence of comorbidities or drug interactions. Start with a low dose and titrate upwards as needed.
