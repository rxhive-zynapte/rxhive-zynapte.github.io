## **Usage**

Metoclopramide is prescribed for the relief of symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis (delayed gastric emptying), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), nausea, and vomiting (including post-operative nausea and vomiting and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting).  It is also used to facilitate small bowel intubation and to aid in radiological examinations of the stomach and small intestine.

It is pharmacologically classified as a prokinetic agent and antiemetic.

Metoclopramide primarily acts as a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the brain, which reduces nausea and vomiting. It also enhances acetylcholine activity in the gut, increasing gastrointestinal motility and promoting gastric emptying.


## **Alternate Names**

International and regional variations of the name include Metoclopramidum and MÃ©toclopramide.

Brand names: Reglan, Maxolon, Maxeran.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Metoclopramide exerts its prokinetic and antiemetic effects through dopamine D2 receptor antagonism and cholinergic agonism. It increases the resting tone of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), improves antral and duodenal contractions, accelerates gastric emptying, and reduces small intestinal transit time. Its antiemetic action is primarily mediated by blocking dopamine D2 receptors in the CTZ.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Metoclopramide is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations reached within 1-2 hours.
* **Metabolism:** It undergoes hepatic metabolism via conjugation and oxidation, primarily by CYP2D6.
* **Elimination:** Metoclopramide is primarily eliminated renally, with a half-life of approximately 4-6 hours.


**Mode of Action:** At the cellular level, metoclopramide blocks dopamine D2 receptors in the CTZ, which reduces the sensitivity of this area to emetogenic stimuli.  In the gastrointestinal tract, it enhances acetylcholine activity by increasing its release and sensitivity, leading to increased motility.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Metoclopramide is a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist. While it does not directly inhibit specific enzymes related to its therapeutic effects, its metabolism is influenced by CYP2D6.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Metoclopramide is primarily excreted by the kidneys (approximately 85%), with the remaining amount excreted in bile.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Diabetic Gastroparesis:** 10 mg orally four times daily, 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime, for 2-8 weeks. Maximum dose: 40 mg/day.
* **GERD:** 10-15 mg orally four times daily, 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime, for 4-12 weeks. Maximum dose: 60 mg/day.
* **Nausea and Vomiting:** 10 mg orally/IM/IV up to three times daily. Maximum dose: 30 mg/day or 0.5 mg/kg/day. Maximum treatment duration: 5 days.

#### **Children:**  Dosing is weight-based and should be determined by a doctor. Pediatric safety is a crucial consideration due to the increased risk of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Start with a lower dose (5 mg four times daily) and titrate based on response and tolerability. The maximum daily dose should be reduced, considering age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Reduce the dose in moderate or severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution should be exercised in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases:**

* **Intubation:** 10 mg IV.
* **Surgical Procedures:**  Dosage varies depending on the specific procedure.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** Dosage is determined by the patient's needs and clinical status.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Dosage is individualized based on patient response.
* **Emergency Situations:** Dosage depends on the specific emergency.


### **Dosage Adjustments:** Dose modification is necessary based on renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms (especially CYP2D6) affecting drug metabolism.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:** Drowsiness, fatigue, restlessness, headache, dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, extrapyramidal symptoms (dystonia, akathisia, parkinsonism).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:** Tardive dyskinesia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), seizures, methemoglobinemia, supraventricular tachycardia, hypotension, QT prolongation.

### **Long-Term Effects:** Tardive dyskinesia can be irreversible.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** Any extrapyramidal symptoms, NMS, hypersensitivity reactions, cardiac arrhythmias.



## **Contraindications**

Absolute contraindications include: pheochromocytoma, gastrointestinal obstruction, perforation, hemorrhage, seizure disorder, history of tardive dyskinesia or dystonic reactions to metoclopramide, concomitant use with drugs that increase EPS risk, and infants <1 year of age. Relative contraindications include Parkinson's disease, depression, and breastfeeding.


## **Drug Interactions**

Metoclopramide interacts with numerous medications, including anticholinergics, dopamine agonists, MAO inhibitors, antipsychotics, CNS depressants (alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids), digoxin, cyclosporine, levodopa, tetracycline. Interactions can also occur with OTC drugs, supplements, and food (alcohol, grapefruit juice).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category:  While generally considered safe during pregnancy, metoclopramide should be used cautiously and only when the benefits outweigh the risks.
Drug excretion in breast milk can occur, with potential for neonatal side effects such as drowsiness or gastrointestinal upset.  The decision to continue or discontinue breastfeeding during metoclopramide therapy should be individualized.
