## **Usage**

Metoprolol Tartrate is prescribed for:

* **Hypertension:**  Managing high blood pressure, often in combination with other antihypertensives.
* **Angina Pectoris:**  Long-term prevention of angina attacks (chest pain).
* **Myocardial Infarction:** Treatment and prevention of heart attacks, both in the acute phase and for long-term management.
* **Heart Failure:**  Managing stable, symptomatic heart failure.
* **Cardiac Arrhythmias:** Controlling certain types of irregular heartbeats.
* **Hyperthyroidism:** As an adjunctive therapy to manage symptoms.
* **Migraine Prevention:** Prophylactic treatment to reduce the frequency and severity of migraine headaches.
* **Other conditions such as anxiety, tremors and alcohol withdrawal.**

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Metoprolol is classified as a **beta-adrenergic blocking agent**, specifically a **selective beta-1 blocker** (cardioselective).  At higher doses, the selectivity for beta-1 receptors decreases.

**Mechanism of Action:** Metoprolol primarily blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors located in the heart. This action reduces heart rate, myocardial contractility, and cardiac output, thereby lowering blood pressure and reducing the workload on the heart.

## **Alternate Names**

**International and Regional Variations:**  The generic name "metoprolol tartrate" is widely recognized.

**Brand Names:** Lopressor is a common brand name for the immediate-release formulation of metoprolol tartrate.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Metoprolol's primary effect is on the cardiovascular system. It reduces heart rate, myocardial contractility, and cardiac output. This leads to a decrease in blood pressure and myocardial oxygen demand.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Metoprolol tartrate is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration.  The presence of food may enhance bioavailability.
* **Metabolism:** It undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver, primarily by the CYP2D6 enzyme. This results in significant interindividual variability in plasma concentrations.
* **Elimination:** Metoprolol and its metabolites are primarily eliminated by the kidneys.


**Mode of Action:** Metoprolol competitively binds to beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, preventing the binding of catecholamines (such as adrenaline and noradrenaline).  This inhibits the sympathetic stimulation of the heart, leading to the observed cardiovascular effects.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Metoprolol is a competitive antagonist at beta-1 adrenergic receptors. It does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of metabolites. Some hepatic metabolism via CYP2D6.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Hypertension:** Initial dose is 100 mg per day, given in single or divided doses.  The dose can be increased at weekly (or longer) intervals up to a maximum of 450 mg per day for immediate-release tablets and 400 mg per day for extended-release formulations.
* **Angina Pectoris:** Initial dose of immediate-release metoprolol tartrate is 50 mg twice daily. For extended-release, 100 mg once daily.  May be increased weekly up to 400 mg per day.
* **Myocardial Infarction (Early Treatment):**  5 mg IV every 2 minutes for three doses, followed by 50 mg orally every 6 hours for 48 hours. Transition to 100 mg twice daily for maintenance.

#### **Children:**

* **Hypertension (Extended-release formulation only):**  For children 6 years and older, the initial dose is 1 mg/kg once daily (maximum 50 mg). May be increased to a maximum of 2 mg/kg (or 200 mg) once daily.  Immediate-release tablets are not recommended for children.
* **Other indications:** Use and dose must be determined by a doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Initiate with a low dose and titrate cautiously.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No dosage adjustment is typically needed.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Start with low doses and titrate very carefully due to increased risk of adverse effects.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized dosing is essential. Close monitoring is required, especially in patients with diabetes, other cardiovascular diseases, or respiratory conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing for these cases should be individualized based on patient status, hemodynamics, and co-existing medical conditions. Consult specialized resources and institutional protocols for specific guidance.

* **Intubation:** Premedication with metoprolol may be considered to attenuate the hemodynamic response. Dosage needs careful titration.
* **Surgical Procedures:** Metoprolol may be used perioperatively to manage blood pressure and heart rate.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** Use with caution due to potential for bradycardia and hypotension.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Dosing is highly patient-specific. Continuous hemodynamic monitoring is crucial.
* **Emergency Situations:** IV administration is preferred for rapid control of heart rate and blood pressure in situations like hypertensive emergencies.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

* Dosage adjustments are based on patient response, tolerability, and renal/hepatic function.
* CYP2D6 genetic polymorphisms can influence metoprolol metabolism, potentially requiring dose adjustments. Slow metabolizers are at increased risk of side effects with standard doses.

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

* Dizziness, fatigue, bradycardia, hypotension, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, shortness of breath, cold hands and feet.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Worsening heart failure, severe bradycardia or heart block, bronchospasm, Raynaud's phenomenon.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

* Some studies suggest potential long-term risks like weight gain, sexual dysfunction. Close monitoring is advised.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

* Severe hypotension, bronchospasm, heart block.


## **Contraindications**

* **Absolute:** Severe bradycardia, second- or third-degree heart block (without a pacemaker), cardiogenic shock, decompensated heart failure, sick sinus syndrome, severe peripheral artery disease.
* **Relative:**  Asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Prinzmetal's angina.


## **Drug Interactions**

Metoprolol interacts with numerous medications. Consult a comprehensive drug interaction resource.  Some clinically significant interactions include:

* **CYP450 Inhibitors:**  Fluoxetine, paroxetine, and other CYP2D6 inhibitors can increase metoprolol levels.
* **CYP450 Inducers:** Rifampin, phenytoin, and other CYP2D6 inducers can reduce metoprolol levels.
* **Calcium Channel Blockers:** Verapamil and diltiazem can enhance bradycardia and hypotension.
* **Digoxin:** Can increase the risk of bradycardia.
* **Clonidine:** Concurrent use may increase rebound hypertension upon discontinuation.
* **Insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents:** Metoprolol can mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia and prolong its effects.
* **MAO inhibitors:**  May result in severe hypertension.
* **Alcohol, smoking, grapefruit juice**: Consumption can be detrimental and potentially dangerous when used concomitantly.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  C (US FDA).  Metoprolol crosses the placenta. Use only if clearly needed and with careful monitoring.  Potential fetal risks include bradycardia, intrauterine growth restriction.
* **Breastfeeding:** Metoprolol is excreted in breast milk.  While generally considered safe, monitor infants for potential side effects such as bradycardia.
