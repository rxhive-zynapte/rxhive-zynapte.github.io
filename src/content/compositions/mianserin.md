      What is the mechanism of action of Mianserin?**


      **A:** Mianserin is a tetracyclic antidepressant that enhances
      noradrenergic and serotonergic transmission. It also blocks
      α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors (both autoreceptors and
      heteroreceptors) and antagonizes 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, and
      H<sub>1</sub> receptors.

## **Usage**

- Mianserin is prescribed for the treatment of major depressive disorder. It may also be used off-label for insomnia at lower doses.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Tetracyclic antidepressant (TeCA).
- **Mechanism of action:** Mianserin enhances noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission by blocking presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic autoreceptors and α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic heteroreceptors located on serotonergic neurons. It also acts as an antagonist at 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, and H<sub>1</sub> receptors.  Mianserin's antidepressant effect is primarily thought to be related to its noradrenergic effects and 5-HT<sub>2</sub> antagonism.


## **Alternate Names**

- Mianserin hydrochloride
- **Brand Names:**  Tolvon, Lumin, Norval


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Mianserin increases noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission by blocking presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic autoreceptors and heteroreceptors.  It also antagonizes 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, and H<sub>1</sub> receptors. Its therapeutic effect in depression is believed to be mediated through the noradrenergic effects and 5-HT<sub>2</sub> antagonism.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Well-absorbed orally.
    - **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6.  Desmethylmianserin is the major active metabolite.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism and subsequent renal excretion. The half-life is prolonged in the elderly.
- **Mode of action:** Antagonism of presynaptic α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic autoreceptors on noradrenergic neurons increases noradrenaline release. Antagonism of α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic heteroreceptors on serotonergic neurons increases serotonin release.  Antagonism of 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors is thought to contribute to its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. 5-HT<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonism likely contribute to side effects such as sedation and weight gain.
- **Receptor binding:** α<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic autoreceptor and heteroreceptor antagonist, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, and H<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist.
- **Elimination pathways:** Hepatic metabolism (CYP2D6) and renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial: 30-40 mg daily, taken as a single dose at bedtime or in divided doses.
- Maintenance:  30-90 mg daily.  May increase up to a maximum of 120-200 mg daily in divided doses.
- The bedtime dose may improve sleep.


#### **Children:**

- Mianserin is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age due to increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initial dose not to exceed 30 mg daily, titrated gradually as needed. A lower maintenance dose may be sufficient.  A single bedtime dose is preferred.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution is advised; dosage adjustments may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment. Monitor renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment. Caution and dose adjustments are necessary in mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution in patients with epilepsy, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, and history of suicidal ideation.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Mianserin is not typically indicated for use in situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its primary indication is for the treatment of major depressive disorder.


### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- Adjust dosage based on patient response and tolerability.
- Reduce dosage in renal or hepatic impairment.
- Consider drug interactions and comorbidities when adjusting the dosage.

- **Antiepileptics:** May lower seizure threshold; reduced efficacy of mianserin with enzyme-inducing antiepileptics (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital).
- **Antihypertensives:** May enhance hypotensive effects (e.g., diazoxide, hydralazine, nitroprusside).
- **CYP2D6 inhibitors:** May increase mianserin levels (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine).
- **CYP2D6 inducers:** May decrease mianserin levels (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Limited human data.  Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.
- **Breastfeeding:** Mianserin is present in breast milk. Use with caution and monitor the infant for adverse effects.
