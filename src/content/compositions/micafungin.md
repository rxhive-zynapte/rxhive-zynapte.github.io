      Can Micafungin be used to treat infections caused by fungi other than

      **A:** The efficacy of micafungin against infections caused by fungi other
      than *Candida* has not been established. While it shows some in vitro
      activity against *Aspergillus*, clinical data supporting its routine use
      for aspergillosis is lacking. It may be considered in cases of refractory
      aspergillosis or in combination with other antifungals, based on expert
      guidance.

      **A:** Treatment duration depends on the infection being treated and
      clinical response.  For invasive candidiasis, treatment should continue
      for at least 14 days.  For prophylaxis in HSCT patients, treatment is
      continued for at least one week after neutrophil recovery.

## **Usage**

Micafungin is an antifungal medication primarily used to treat and prevent invasive *Candida* infections. This includes candidemia, acute disseminated candidiasis, *Candida* peritonitis, abscesses, and esophageal candidiasis. It's also used prophylactically in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) who are at high risk of developing *Candida* infections.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Echinocandin antifungal.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Micafungin noncompetitively inhibits the synthesis of 1,3-β-D-glucan, an essential component of the fungal cell wall. This leads to cell wall instability and fungal cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Micafungin

- **Brand Name:** Mycamine


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Micafungin exerts its antifungal activity by disrupting the fungal cell wall. By inhibiting 1,3-β-D-glucan synthase, it prevents the formation of 1,3-β-D-glucan, a crucial polysaccharide in the fungal cell wall. This weakens the structural integrity of the cell wall, leading to cell lysis and death. Micafungin exhibits fungicidal activity against some *Candida* species at higher concentrations and fungistatic activity at lower concentrations, particularly against *Aspergillus*.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Administered intravenously, therefore 100% bioavailability.
    - **Distribution:** Highly protein-bound (>99%). Micafungin demonstrates dose-dependent penetration into the central nervous system (CNS).
    - **Metabolism:** Limited hepatic metabolism.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily through biliary excretion; a small portion is renally excreted. The elimination half-life allows for once-daily dosing.

- **Mode of Action:** Micafungin targets the fungal cell wall by inhibiting 1,3-β-D-glucan synthase. This enzyme is critical for the synthesis of 1,3-β-D-glucan, a major structural component of the fungal cell wall.

- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Micafungin acts through noncompetitive inhibition of 1,3-β-D-glucan synthase.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily biliary excretion with minimal renal excretion.  It is not dialyzable due to high protein binding.


## **Dosage**
