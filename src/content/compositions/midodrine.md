## **Usage**

Midodrine is primarily prescribed for the treatment of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, a condition characterized by a drop in blood pressure upon standing, leading to dizziness, lightheadedness, and even syncope. It can also be used off-label to treat certain types of urinary incontinence (stress incontinence) and for weaning patients off intravenous vasopressors in intensive care unit settings.  It is classified as a **vasopressor** and an **α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic agonist**.

Midodrine's mechanism of action involves its conversion to the active metabolite, desglymidodrine, which stimulates alpha-1 adrenergic receptors in arterioles and veins. This stimulation causes vasoconstriction, increasing peripheral vascular resistance and venous return, thereby raising blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

Midodrine hydrochloride is the chemical name. Brand names include ProAmatine and Orvaten.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Midodrine itself is inactive but is rapidly converted to desglymidodrine, its active metabolite. Desglymidodrine acts as an agonist at α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction in both arteries and veins. This leads to an increase in peripheral vascular resistance and venous return, elevating blood pressure. It has minimal effect on beta-adrenergic or dopaminergic receptors.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Midodrine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. It undergoes rapid hepatic conversion to desglymidodrine. Peak plasma concentrations of desglymidodrine are reached in approximately 1-2 hours. The elimination half-life is about 3-4 hours. It's primarily excreted by the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** Desglymidodrine binds to α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells, activating intracellular signaling pathways that result in vasoconstriction. This increased vascular tone leads to the observed pressor effect.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Desglymidodrine is an α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor agonist and does not directly inhibit enzymes or modulate neurotransmitters.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of desglymidodrine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Orthostatic Hypotension:** Initial dose: 2.5 mg orally two to three times daily. The dose can be increased weekly by 2.5 mg increments until an optimal response is achieved, usually up to 10 mg three times a day.  Maximum dose is 30mg/day.
* **Intravenous Vasopressor Weaning:** 5-40 mg orally every 8 hours.


#### **Children:**

Limited data available. Use with caution and initiate at lower doses.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Initiate with a lower dose (2.5 mg twice or thrice daily) and titrate cautiously.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Start with 2.5 mg every 8 hours and adjust based on response.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Exercise caution and monitor closely. Data limited.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring is necessary for patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other relevant conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**


The use of Midodrine in clinical settings like Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, and Emergency Situations (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest) is off-label and requires careful monitoring. The common dosage range for weaning off intravenous vasopressors is 5–40 mg every 8 hours


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments should be made based on patient-specific factors, including renal or hepatic dysfunction and other comorbid conditions.

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

* Piloerection (goosebumps)
