## **Usage**

- Milk of Magnesia is prescribed for the relief of occasional constipation and to treat symptoms of heartburn, upset stomach, and acid indigestion.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Saline laxative and antacid.
- **Mechanism of Action:** As a laxative, Milk of Magnesia works by drawing water into the intestines, softening the stool and promoting bowel movements. As an antacid, it neutralizes stomach acid.

## **Alternate Names**

- Magnesium hydroxide
- Magnesium milk
- **Brand Names:** Phillips' Milk of Magnesia, Milk of Magnesia (various manufacturers)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Milk of Magnesia acts as an osmotic laxative by increasing osmotic pressure within the intestinal lumen, drawing water into the bowel, and stimulating peristalsis. As an antacid, it neutralizes gastric acid, increasing the pH of stomach contents. This action relieves the symptoms of heartburn and acid indigestion.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Orally administered magnesium hydroxide is poorly absorbed systemically. The unabsorbed portion exerts its laxative effect within the intestine. Some absorption of magnesium ions can occur, especially with higher doses or frequent use. Absorbed magnesium is primarily excreted by the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:** In constipation, the osmotic action of Milk of Magnesia increases water content in the stool and stimulates intestinal motility. In heartburn, it directly neutralizes gastric hydrochloric acid. No receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation are involved in its primary mechanisms of action.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion; unabsorbed magnesium is eliminated in feces.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Constipation:** 30-60 mL orally per day, preferably at bedtime.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lower end of the dose range and adjust as needed. Monitor renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Avoid Milk of Magnesia due to the risk of magnesium accumulation and toxicity.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dose adjustment may not be necessary, but caution is advised.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider underlying conditions and potential drug interactions.
