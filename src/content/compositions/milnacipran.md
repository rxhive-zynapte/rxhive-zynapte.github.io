## **Usage**

- Milnacipran is prescribed for the management of fibromyalgia in adults.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Milnacipran increases the levels of both serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain by inhibiting their reuptake at nerve terminals. This action is believed to contribute to its analgesic and mood-improving effects in fibromyalgia.

## **Alternate Names**

-  International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Milnacipran
- **Brand names:** Savella

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Milnacipran's primary effect is to increase the synaptic concentrations of serotonin and norepinephrine, neurotransmitters involved in pain signaling and mood regulation. The precise mechanism by which this alleviates fibromyalgia symptoms is not fully understood but it is believed that altered pain processing in the central nervous system is a major factor.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Milnacipran is well-absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations reached within 2-3 hours. Food intake may slightly delay absorption but does not significantly affect overall bioavailability.
    - **Metabolism:** Milnacipran undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver, primarily via conjugation. Cytochrome P450 enzymes play a minor role in its metabolism.
    - **Elimination:**  Milnacipran is primarily eliminated through renal excretion, with a small portion excreted in the feces. The elimination half-life is approximately 8 hours, which supports twice-daily dosing.
- **Mode of Action:** Milnacipran inhibits the reuptake transporters for serotonin and norepinephrine, increasing their availability in the synaptic cleft. This leads to enhanced neurotransmission in pathways relevant to pain modulation and mood.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Primarily inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake transporters. It has a three-fold higher selectivity for norepinephrine reuptake inhibition compared to serotonin.
- **Elimination pathways:** Predominantly renal excretion of unchanged drug and metabolites.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial: 12.5 mg orally once daily on day 1.
- Days 2-3: 12.5 mg orally twice daily.
- Days 4-7: 25 mg orally twice daily.
- Maintenance: 50 mg orally twice daily.
- Maximum: 200 mg orally per day (100 mg twice daily) if tolerated.
- Administration: Oral, with or without food. Food intake may improve tolerability.

#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy not established in patients younger than 18 years. Not recommended for pediatric use.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: Renal function should be assessed prior to initiation.  Consider lower starting doses due to age-related decline in renal function. Monitor for hyponatremia.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**:
    - Mild (CrCl 50-80 mL/min): No dosage adjustment necessary.
    - Moderate (CrCl 30-49 mL/min): Use with caution.
    - Severe (CrCl 5-29 mL/min): Reduce maintenance dose by 50% (25 mg twice daily). May increase to 50 mg twice daily if tolerated.
    - End-stage renal disease (ESRD): Not recommended.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**:
    - Mild to moderate impairment: No adjustment required.
    - Severe impairment: Use with caution.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Caution should be exercised in patients with uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or seizure disorders. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate regularly.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Milnacipran is specifically indicated for fibromyalgia management. It is not indicated for other clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

## **Contraindications**

- Concurrent or recent (within 14 days) use of MAOIs.
- Concurrent use of linezolid or intravenous methylene blue.
- Uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma.

## **Drug Interactions**

- **MAOIs:** Contraindicated due to the risk of serotonin syndrome and hypertensive crisis.
- **Serotonergic drugs (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, buspirone, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, St. John's wort):** Increased risk of serotonin syndrome.
- **Drugs that impair serotonin metabolism (e.g., linezolid, methylene blue):** Increased risk of serotonin syndrome.
- **Drugs that affect blood pressure or heart rate:**  Caution advised as milnacipran can cause hypertension and tachycardia.
- **CYP450 interactions:** Limited potential. 
- **Alcohol:** Moderate consumption is advised.
- **Anticoagulants/NSAIDs:** Increased risk of bleeding.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C.  Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus. Neonates exposed in the third trimester may experience withdrawal symptoms or serotonin syndrome.
