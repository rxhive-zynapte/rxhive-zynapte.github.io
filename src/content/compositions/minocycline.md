## **Usage**

Minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, is prescribed for various infectious and non-infectious conditions.  Its primary use is to treat infections caused by susceptible gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including *Acinetobacter*, *Actinomyces*, *Chlamydia*, *Mycoplasma*, *Rickettsia*, and *Streptococcus* species. It is also effective against some protozoa.  Beyond its antimicrobial action, minocycline exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and immunomodulatory properties, rendering it useful in managing acne, rosacea, rheumatoid arthritis, and even showing potential in neurodegenerative diseases due to its neuroprotective effects.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Tetracycline antibiotic

**Mechanism of Action:** Minocycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, preventing the attachment of aminoacyl-tRNA to the mRNA-ribosome complex. This bacteriostatic action halts bacterial growth and allows the immune system to eliminate the pathogens.

## **Alternate Names**

Minocycline hydrochloride (salt form), 7-dimethylamino-6-demethyl-6-deoxytetracycline

**Brand Names:** Minocin, Dynacin, Solodyn, Ximino, Vectrin

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Minocycline exerts its primary effect by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. Its anti-inflammatory effects are mediated through suppression of matrix metalloproteinases and other inflammatory mediators.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 2-4 hours.  Absorption is reduced by divalent and trivalent cations (e.g., calcium, iron, magnesium, aluminum) found in antacids, dairy products, and supplements.
* **Distribution:** Widely distributed throughout the body, including tissues, fluids, and bones. It penetrates the cerebrospinal fluid, making it effective against central nervous system infections.
* **Metabolism:** Partially metabolized in the liver.
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted in urine and feces.  Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with renal impairment.

**Mode of Action (Cellular/Molecular):** Binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria, blocking aminoacyl-tRNA binding and inhibiting protein synthesis.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Primarily inhibits bacterial protein synthesis; also inhibits matrix metalloproteinases and other inflammatory mediators.

**Elimination Pathways:** Renal and hepatic excretion; some biliary excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral:** 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours.  Alternatively, 50 mg four times daily. For acne: 50-100 mg twice daily.  For rosacea (Emrosi): 40 mg once daily.
* **IV:** 200 mg initially, followed by 100 mg every 12 hours (infused over 60 minutes).  Maximum daily dose: 400 mg.

#### **Children (8 years and older):**

* **Oral:** 4 mg/kg initially, followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours (not to exceed adult dose).
* **IV:**  4 mg/kg initially, followed by 2 mg/kg every 12 hours (infused over 60 minutes; not to exceed adult dose).

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Use standard dosage with caution. Monitor renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce dosage and/or extend dosing intervals.  No specific guidelines are available, but consider reducing the total daily dose to 200 mg or less.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution; monitor liver function tests.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate potential drug interactions and adjust dosage accordingly for conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular disease.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for these scenarios generally align with the standard adult dosages.  IV administration may be preferred initially in critically ill patients:

* **Intubation:** Standard dosage.
* **Surgical Procedures:** Standard dosage.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** Standard dosage.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Standard dosage.
* **Emergency Situations:** Standard dosage.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary for patients with renal impairment. Reduce the total daily dose and/or extend dosing intervals. Monitor drug serum levels during prolonged therapy.  Adjustments may also be needed based on drug interactions, comorbid conditions, and individual patient response.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, skin discoloration (especially with long-term use), photosensitivity.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Drug-induced lupus, autoimmune hepatitis, serum sickness, pseudomembranous colitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, intracranial hypertension, hepatotoxicity, hypersensitivity reactions (angioedema, anaphylaxis).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Tooth discoloration in children under 8 years of age, thyroid discoloration, drug-induced lupus.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Anaphylaxis, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, intracranial hypertension, severe hepatotoxicity.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to tetracyclines.
* Pregnancy (Category D).

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Antacids, iron supplements, calcium supplements, magnesium-containing laxatives:** Reduced minocycline absorption.
* **Oral contraceptives:** Reduced efficacy of oral contraceptives.
* **Anticoagulants (warfarin):** Enhanced anticoagulant effect.

* **Methotrexate:** Increased methotrexate toxicity.
* **Penicillins:** Reduced bactericidal activity of penicillins.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy Safety Category:** D

Minocycline is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of permanent tooth discoloration and skeletal development issues in the fetus.

Minocycline is excreted in breast milk.  Its use during breastfeeding is generally not recommended due to potential risks to the infant, such as tooth discoloration.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, skin discoloration, photosensitivity; rarely, serious reactions like drug-induced lupus and intracranial hypertension.
