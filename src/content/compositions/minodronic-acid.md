## **Usage**

- Minodronic acid is prescribed for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men. It helps increase bone mass and reduce the risk of fractures.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Bisphosphonate
- **Mechanism of action:** Minodronic acid inhibits bone resorption by acting on osteoclasts (cells that break down bone tissue). This leads to an increase in bone mineral density and strengthens bones, making them less prone to fractures.

## **Alternate Names**

- Minodronate
- **Brand names:** Bonoteo, Recalbon

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Minodronic acid binds to hydroxyapatite crystals in bone, inhibiting osteoclast activity and reducing bone resorption. This leads to increased bone mineral density and improved bone strength.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Oral bioavailability is low (around 1%). Food, especially high-fat meals, further reduces absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Minodronic acid is not extensively metabolized.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine. The elimination half-life is relatively short.
- **Mode of action:** Minodronic acid inhibits farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, an enzyme crucial for osteoclast function. This disruption of the mevalonate pathway in osteoclasts leads to their apoptosis (programmed cell death) and reduces bone resorption.
- **Receptor binding/Enzyme inhibition:** Binds to hydroxyapatite in bone and inhibits farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 50 mg orally once every 4 weeks, taken in the morning upon waking with a full glass of water (approximately 180 mL). Patients should remain upright for at least 30 minutes after administration and avoid food, beverages (other than plain water), and other medications during this period.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is generally required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary in patients with severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment is generally required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution should be exercised in patients with esophageal disorders or hypocalcemia.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Minodronic acid is specifically indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis. Its use in other clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations is not established.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments may be required based on renal function.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Stomach discomfort
- Abdominal pain
- Gastritis

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Esophageal irritation or ulceration
- Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ)
- Atypical femoral fractures
- Hypocalcemia

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Long-term use may be associated with an increased risk of atypical femoral fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Esophageal reactions, ONJ, atypical femoral fractures, and severe hypocalcemia require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to minodronic acid or any other bisphosphonates.
- Esophageal abnormalities that delay esophageal emptying (e.g., stricture, achalasia).
- Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes.
- Hypocalcemia.
- Severe renal impairment.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Calcium supplements and antacids can reduce the absorption of minodronic acid. Administer these several hours apart.
- NSAIDs and aspirin may increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects.
- Drugs affecting renal function (e.g., aminoglycosides, diuretics) may require monitoring and dosage adjustments.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Not established.  Not recommended for use during pregnancy unless absolutely necessary.
- **Breastfeeding:** Not recommended. Excretion in breast milk is unknown, and potential effects on infants are not well studied.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, increasing bone density.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, stomach/abdominal discomfort, esophageal irritation (rare), ONJ (rare), atypical femoral fractures (rare).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, esophageal abnormalities, inability to remain upright, hypocalcemia, severe renal impairment.
- **Drug Interactions:** Calcium supplements, antacids, NSAIDs, drugs affecting renal function.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Not recommended.
- **Dosage:** 50 mg oral once every 4 weeks.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Serum calcium, renal function tests, bone mineral density.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Calcium and vitamin D supplementation may be recommended to ensure adequate calcium intake.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess renal function, esophageal function, and calcium levels before initiating therapy. Maintain good oral hygiene during treatment.
- **Specific Populations:** Use with caution in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Not recommended in children.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Patients should maintain adequate hydration.
