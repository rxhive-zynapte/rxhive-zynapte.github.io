## Usage

Minoxidil is primarily prescribed for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia (male and female pattern baldness) and severe, resistant hypertension.  It is classified as a vasodilator (for hypertension) and a hair growth stimulant (for alopecia).  The exact mechanism of action in hair regrowth isn't fully understood, but it is thought to stimulate hair follicle growth and prolong the anagen phase (growth phase) of the hair cycle by widening blood vessels and opening potassium channels in cells, potentially improving follicular blood flow.  For hypertension, minoxidil acts as a direct arterial vasodilator, reducing peripheral vascular resistance and lowering blood pressure.

## Alternate Names

Minoxidil is also known as 2,4-diamino-6-piperidinopyrimidine-3-oxide. Common brand names include Rogaine, Loniten, and Headway.  Regaine is a popular brand specifically for topical minoxidil solutions or foam.


## How It Works

**Pharmacodynamics:** Minoxidil's primary action is vasodilation, leading to increased blood flow. In hair follicles, this vasodilation may stimulate hair growth by providing better nutrient supply and oxygenation.  In hypertension treatment, the vasodilatory effect reduces peripheral vascular resistance, thus lowering blood pressure.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Topical minoxidil has limited systemic absorption.  Orally administered minoxidil is well-absorbed, with a bioavailability of nearly 100%. It is metabolized in the liver, primarily by conjugation with glucuronic acid, and excreted mainly through the kidneys.  Cytochrome P450 enzymes are not significantly involved in its metabolism.

**Mode of Action:** Minoxidil acts by opening potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells. This hyperpolarizes the cell membrane, inhibiting calcium influx and leading to vasodilation.  The exact mechanism for hair growth stimulation is not fully understood, but it is believed to be linked to potassium channel opening and improved follicular blood supply. Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation have not been definitively linked to minoxidil's hair growth effects.


## Dosage

### Standard Dosage

#### Adults:

* **Oral (for hypertension):** Initial dose: 5 mg/day,  May be gradually increased up to 40 mg/day, Maximum: 100 mg/day (in divided doses).
* **Topical (for alopecia):**  1 ml of 2% or 5% solution applied twice daily, or half a capful of 5% foam applied twice daily to affected areas.

#### Children:

* **Oral (for hypertension):** Initial dose: 0.2 mg/kg/day, may be increased in increments of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg/day every 3 days, Maximum: 50 mg/day. Pediatric use should be closely supervised by a specialist due to potential side effects.
* **Topical (for alopecia):** Not typically recommended for children. Usage and dosage should be determined by a doctor.


#### Special Cases:

* **Elderly Patients:** Initial oral dose of 2.5 mg/day for hypertension, with careful titration.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be necessary for oral minoxidil in cases of renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution advised, but no specific dose adjustments provided. Close monitoring needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor carefully for drug interactions and adjust accordingly.


### Clinical Use Cases

Minoxidil's clinical use in situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like cardiac arrest primarily pertains to its intravenous formulation used for hypertensive emergencies. Dosage in these situations is titrated to effect under close monitoring, often starting at low doses and gradually increasing until the desired blood pressure is achieved. This is beyond the scope of this guide, and clinicians should refer to specific hospital protocols for the management of hypertensive emergencies.

### Dosage Adjustments

Dose adjustments may be required in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  Metabolic disorders and genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism should be considered.


## Side Effects

### Common Side Effects

* Topical: Local irritation, itching, redness, dryness, unwanted hair growth on adjacent skin.
* Oral: Dizziness, drowsiness, headache, peripheral edema, tachycardia, palpitations, increased hair growth.

### Rare but Serious Side Effects

* Topical: Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing), chest pain, rapid heartbeat, swelling in hands or feet, rapid weight gain, fainting.
* Oral:  Fluid retention and heart failure, pericardial effusion, angina pectoris, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.


### Long-Term Effects

Prolonged oral minoxidil use can lead to hirsutism (excessive hair growth), hypertrichosis, and changes in hair texture or color.


### Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)

Clinically significant ADRs needing immediate intervention include allergic reactions, severe hypotension, angina, pericardial effusion, and heart failure.

## Contraindications

* Hypersensitivity to minoxidil or any component of the formulation.
* Pheochromocytoma (oral minoxidil).
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding (oral minoxidil use is generally avoided).
* Active scalp inflammation or infection (topical).


## Drug Interactions

* Guanethidine: Can cause severe orthostatic hypotension.
* Diuretics:  Used concurrently to manage fluid retention.
* Beta-blockers: Often co-administered to control reflex tachycardia.
* Other antihypertensives: Additive effects can occur.

Refer to a comprehensive drug interaction database for a complete list of potential drug interactions, especially for oral minoxidil, which has many interactions. Interactions with OTC drugs, supplements, food, and lifestyle factors like alcohol and smoking are less documented but should be considered.

## Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

* **Pregnancy:** Topical minoxidil use is generally not recommended. Oral minoxidil is contraindicated due to potential fetal harm.
* **Breastfeeding:** Both topical and oral minoxidil can be excreted in breast milk.  While data on infant exposure is limited, use during breastfeeding is not recommended.

## Drug Profile Summary

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Vasodilator (hypertension); stimulates hair follicle growth (alopecia).
* **Side Effects:** Topical: local irritation, unwanted hair growth. Oral: fluid retention, dizziness, tachycardia, hypertrichosis.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, pheochromocytoma (oral), pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** Guanethidine, other antihypertensives, diuretics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Not recommended.
* **Dosage:**  See section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, heart rate, weight, signs of fluid retention, hair growth.

## Popular Combinations

For hypertension, minoxidil is often prescribed with a beta-blocker to control reflex tachycardia and a loop diuretic to manage fluid retention.

## Precautions

* Pre-existing cardiovascular, renal, or hepatic disease necessitates careful monitoring.
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding require careful consideration of risks and benefits.
* Monitor for hypertrichosis and other side effects.
