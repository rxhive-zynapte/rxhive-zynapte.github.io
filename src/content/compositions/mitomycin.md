      **A:** Extravasation is a serious complication that can occur if mitomycin
      leaks out of the vein and into surrounding tissues. Signs of extravasation
      include pain, burning, swelling, redness, and blistering at or near the
      injection site. If extravasation is suspected, immediately stop the
      infusion and consult extravasation guidelines for appropriate management
      which may include local injection of an antidote and application of cold
      compresses.

## **Usage**

Mitomycin is an antineoplastic/antibiotic medication primarily used in palliative chemotherapy for various advanced or metastatic cancers.  These include:

* Advanced metastatic gastric carcinoma
* Advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer
* Non-small cell bronchial carcinoma
* Advanced pancreatic carcinoma

It is also administered intravesically for relapse prevention in superficial urinary bladder carcinoma after transurethral resection. Additionally, it is used as an adjunct in ophthalmic surgery, specifically glaucoma filtration surgery.  The pharmacological classification of mitomycin is an alkylating agent antibiotic.

Mitomycin's mechanism of action involves bioreductive activation within cells, leading to the formation of alkylating metabolites. These metabolites cross-link DNA strands, inhibiting DNA synthesis and function, and ultimately leading to cell death. This activity is particularly pronounced in hypoxic tumor environments.


## **Alternate Names**

Mitomycin-C,  Mutamycin (brand name), Jelmyto (brand name, for intravesical use in upper tract urothelial cancer) and Mitosol (ophthalmic).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Mitomycin exerts its cytotoxic effects primarily through DNA crosslinking.  This disrupts cellular processes, including DNA replication and transcription, ultimately leading to cell death. This effect is more pronounced in hypoxic conditions often found in solid tumors.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Mitomycin is rapidly distributed throughout the body after intravenous administration. It is metabolized primarily in the liver, with minor contributions from other tissues, including the kidneys.  Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination for mitomycin and its metabolites. Metabolism involves reduction by various enzymes to active metabolites, while hepatic pathways involving CYP enzymes may also contribute.

**Mode of Action:** Mitomycin undergoes enzymatic reduction within cells to become activated. These reduced metabolites form covalent bonds with DNA, primarily at guanine residues.  This cross-linking hinders DNA replication and transcription, triggering cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (programmed cell death).

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Mitomycin's primary action is through direct DNA damage and doesn't typically involve receptor binding, specific enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

**Intravenous:** 10-20 mg/m² body surface area every 6-8 weeks, 8-12 mg/m² every 3-4 weeks, or 5-10 mg/m² every 1-6 weeks depending on the regimen. The maximum cumulative dose is 60 mg/m².  Doses greater than 20 mg/m² are associated with increased toxicity without added therapeutic benefit.  Combination therapy uses lower doses. Mitomycin is administered as an intravenous bolus injection or infusion.

**Intravesical (Bladder):** 20-40 mg in 20-40 ml of phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) or sodium chloride 0.9% solution instilled weekly into the bladder for 8-12 weeks. Alternative regimens include 4-10 mg (0.06-0.15 mg/kg) instilled once or three times per week. The solution should be retained for 1-2 hours. For prophylaxis, 20mg every two weeks or 40 mg every month or every three months.

**Intravesical (Upper Tract Urothelial Cancer):** 4 mg/mL, with a maximum of 60 mg mitomycin, administered once weekly for six instillations. Maintenance therapy may be given monthly for up to 11 months in responding patients. Sodium Bicarbonate should be given to patients the day before, day of, and 30 minutes before instillation.

**Ophthalmic:** 0.2 mg/mL applied topically during glaucoma filtration surgery for two minutes using saturated sponges.



#### **Children:**

The safety and efficacy of mitomycin in children have not been established.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose reduction might be necessary due to potential age-related decline in organ function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are required, and use is generally avoided in severe renal dysfunction (serum creatinine > 1.7 mg/dL or creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min).
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, although specific dose adjustments are not well-defined.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Careful consideration and dose modification may be necessary based on the specific comorbidity, especially in patients with pre-existing myelosuppression.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Mitomycin is *not* indicated for intubation, general surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or general emergency situations like cardiac arrest or status epilepticus.  Its use is specifically restricted to cancer treatment as indicated above and as an adjunct in glaucoma filtration surgery.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based primarily on hematological parameters (leukocyte and platelet counts), renal function, prior chemotherapy regimens, and the presence of other toxicities.  Dosage should be reduced or withheld if myelosuppression occurs, or if other significant organ toxicities are observed.  Specific guidelines for dose reductions based on blood counts and renal function are available (See source data).



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, anorexia (loss of appetite), fever, fatigue, myelosuppression (decreased blood cell counts), alopecia (hair loss), stomatitis (mouth sores), skin reactions.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Pulmonary toxicity (pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease), hemolytic uremic syndrome, renal toxicity, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia,  interstitial nephritis.


### **Long-Term Effects**

Cumulative myelosuppression, secondary malignancies, pulmonary fibrosis, renal insufficiency.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),  severe myelosuppression requiring transfusions, extravasation injury (tissue necrosis at injection site if administered outside the vein).



## **Contraindications**

Absolute contraindications include hypersensitivity to mitomycin, severe myelosuppression (pancytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia), hemorrhagic diathesis (bleeding disorders), and active infections. Relative contraindications include impaired renal function, pre-existing lung disease, and recent or concurrent radiotherapy. Perforation of the bladder wall is an absolute contraindication for intravesical use, and cystitis is a relative contraindication.  Pregnancy is a contraindication for mitomycin except in life-threatening situations.


## **Drug Interactions**

Mitomycin interacts with numerous medications, including other myelosuppressive agents (additive bone marrow toxicity),  vinca alkaloids (increased risk of pulmonary toxicity), and vaccines (reduced efficacy). It can also interact with drugs metabolized by CYP450 enzymes, potentially affecting their clearance. Consult drug interaction resources for a comprehensive list. Concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs is not recommended.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Mitomycin is contraindicated during pregnancy (Pregnancy Category X) due to its teratogenic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic potential. It should also be avoided during breastfeeding due to the risk of transmission to the infant through breast milk.
