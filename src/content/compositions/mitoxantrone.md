## **Usage**

Mitoxantrone is an antineoplastic agent, specifically an anthracenedione, primarily indicated for:

* **Multiple Sclerosis (MS):** Reducing neurologic disability and/or the frequency of clinical relapses in patients with secondary (chronic) progressive, progressive relapsing, or worsening relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.
* **Acute Nonlymphocytic Leukemia (ANLL):**  Used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for the initial treatment of ANLL in adults.
* **Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer:** Used to treat pain associated with hormone-refractory prostate cancer, often in combination with corticosteroids.

Its pharmacological classification is antineoplastic/immunosuppressant.  Mitoxantrone's mechanism of action involves intercalation into DNA, disrupting DNA synthesis and repair, and inhibiting topoisomerase II, an enzyme essential for DNA replication. This leads to cell death, impacting rapidly dividing cells like cancer cells and immune cells.

## **Alternate Names**

* Novantrone (brand name, now discontinued in the US)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Mitoxantrone exerts its cytotoxic effects by intercalating between DNA base pairs, disrupting DNA and RNA synthesis, and inhibiting topoisomerase II, thereby preventing DNA repair. It leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in rapidly dividing cells, affecting both cancer and immune cells.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Administered intravenously, achieving peak plasma concentrations rapidly.
* **Distribution:** Widely distributed, with high protein binding (primarily to albumin).
* **Metabolism:** Hepatically metabolized, but specific pathways remain undetermined. Active and inactive metabolites exist.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through biliary excretion into feces, with a smaller portion through renal excretion in urine. The terminal half-life is variable (23-215 hours) and may be prolonged in patients with hepatic impairment.

**Mode of Action:** Mitoxantrone intercalates into DNA, causing strand breaks and inhibiting DNA and RNA synthesis.  It also inhibits topoisomerase II, preventing DNA repair. This ultimately leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Primarily topoisomerase II inhibition and DNA intercalation.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Multiple Sclerosis:** 12 mg/m² as a short intravenous infusion every 3 months. The maximum lifetime cumulative dose is 140 mg/m².
* **Acute Nonlymphocytic Leukemia (ANLL):** 12 mg/m²/day IV on days 1-3, often in combination with cytarabine.  A second induction course might be given at adjusted doses if the response is incomplete and there is no severe non-hematologic toxicity.
* **Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer:** 12-14 mg/m² as a short intravenous infusion every 3 weeks.

#### **Children:**

Safety and efficacy not established.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  May require dose reduction due to age-related decline in organ function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No dose adjustment is typically required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction (e.g., 50% in mild to moderate impairment) is necessary.  Mitoxantrone is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring for cardiac events is crucial for patients with prior anthracycline exposure, mediastinal radiation, or pre-existing heart disease. Dosage adjustments might be needed.

### **Clinical Use Cases**
