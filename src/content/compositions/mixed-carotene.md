      Can Mixed Carotene turn my skin orange?


      **A:** High doses of beta-carotene, a component of mixed carotene, can
      cause carotenodermia, a harmless yellowing of the skin.  This effect is
      usually reversible with dose reduction.

## Usage

Mixed carotene is primarily used as a dietary supplement to increase the intake of carotenoids, particularly when dietary intake is insufficient. It is also utilized for its potential antioxidant properties and photoprotective effects against UV radiation.  It is classified as a nutritional supplement. The mechanism of action involves the scavenging of free radicals and the absorption of UV light, reducing oxidative stress and sun-induced skin damage, respectively.

## Alternate Names

- Mixed Carotenes
- E160a (ii) (as a food additive)
- Provitamin A carotenoids (partially referring to carotenoids that can be converted to vitamin A)


## How It Works

**Pharmacodynamics:** Mixed carotenes exhibit antioxidant activity by neutralizing reactive oxygen species. Some components, like beta-carotene, act as precursors to vitamin A, essential for vision, cell growth, and immune function. Specific carotenoids, such as lutein and zeaxanthin, accumulate in the macula of the eye and provide protection against age-related macular degeneration. Lycopene contributes to antioxidant defense and may have specific protective effects against certain cancers. 

**Pharmacokinetics:** Carotenoids are absorbed with dietary fats in the small intestine. They are then incorporated into chylomicrons and transported to the liver. Further distribution occurs through lipoproteins.  The conversion of some carotenoids to vitamin A occurs in the intestine and liver. Excretion occurs via bile and feces.



## Dosage


### Standard Dosage

#### Adults:

The recommended dosage for mixed carotene varies depending on the specific formulation and intended use. As a dietary supplement, a typical dose might range from 6 to 15 mg of beta-carotene equivalents per day.  However, individualized dosages should be determined based on dietary intake, health status, and specific product formulations.


#### Children:

Pediatric dosing should be determined based on age, weight, and specific product formulations.  Consulting a healthcare professional is advised.  Lower doses than adults are typically recommended, ranging from 3 to 6 mg of beta-carotene equivalents per day. Pediatric safety considerations include ensuring age-appropriate formulations and avoiding exceeding safe upper intake levels.

#### Special Cases:

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are generally recommended for elderly patients, but individual needs and tolerances should be considered.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are generally necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are generally necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Patients with specific health conditions should consult a healthcare professional for personalized dosage guidance.

### Clinical Use Cases

Mixed carotene supplements are not typically indicated for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### Dosage Adjustments

Dose adjustments might be necessary based on individual dietary intake, specific health conditions, or as advised by a healthcare professional.


## Side Effects

### Common Side Effects

Supplementation with high doses of beta-carotene may cause a temporary harmless yellowing of the skin, particularly noticeable on the palms and soles. This discoloration, known as carotenodermia, usually disappears when the intake is reduced.


### Rare but Serious Side Effects

At very high doses, beta-carotene supplementation may have been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer in smokers and individuals exposed to asbestos.


### Long-Term Effects

Long-term effects of mixed carotene supplementation require further research, but generally, carotenoids are considered safe within recommended intake ranges.




## Contraindications

Smokers and those with a history of asbestos exposure should avoid high-dose beta-carotene supplementation.  Individuals with specific health conditions should consult with a healthcare professional before starting mixed carotene supplementation.



## Drug Interactions

Limited specific drug interactions have been reported with mixed carotene.  However, it's important to be aware of potential interactions with other medications, particularly those affecting vitamin A metabolism.  It is advisable to disclose any supplement use, including mixed carotene, to healthcare providers.


## Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Mixed carotene supplementation within recommended dietary ranges is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, excessive vitamin A intake should be avoided during pregnancy due to potential teratogenic risks.
