## **Usage**

- Molnupiravir is an antiviral medication prescribed for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in non-hospitalized adult patients who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19 (e.g., hospitalization, death), or in patients for whom alternative COVID-19 treatment options are not accessible or clinically appropriate.  It should be administered within 5 days of symptom onset.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antiviral agent, specifically a nucleoside analogue.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Molnupiravir introduces errors into the SARS-CoV-2 virus's RNA during replication. These errors accumulate, ultimately inhibiting viral replication.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Molnupiravir.
- **Brand Name:** Lagevrio.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Molnupiravir is a prodrug that is metabolized to its active form, N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC). NHC acts as a ribonucleoside analogue, resembling cytidine and uridine.  During viral RNA replication, NHC can be incorporated in place of either cytidine or uridine. This leads to an accumulation of mutations in the viral genome, impairing viral replication.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - **Absorption:**  Administered orally; rapidly absorbed.
    - **Metabolism:** Converted to active NHC triphosphate.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion, with minimal hepatic metabolism.

- **Mode of Action:**  Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase incorporation of NHC. Lethal mutagenesis of SARS-CoV-2. 
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Not applicable to Molnupiravir's mechanism.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 800 mg (four 200 mg capsules) every 12 hours for 5 days. Administer orally with or without food.  Treatment duration should not exceed 5 days.

#### **Children:**

- Not authorized for use in patients under 18 years of age.  Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric populations. Molnupiravir may affect bone and cartilage growth.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific dose adjustments based on comorbidities are indicated, but clinical judgment should be applied considering the patient's overall condition.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Molnupiravir is indicated only for *outpatient* treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19.  It is **not** indicated for use in hospitalized patients or for pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- No dose adjustments based on renal or hepatic function, age, or other factors are required.


## **Side Effects**
