## **Usage**

Mosapride is prescribed for the symptomatic treatment of functional dyspepsia (also known as chronic gastritis) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).  It alleviates symptoms such as heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and upper abdominal discomfort. Pharmacologically, it is classified as a gastroprokinetic agent, specifically a selective serotonin 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor agonist. Mosapride's mechanism of action involves stimulating 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to increased release of acetylcholine and enhanced gastrointestinal motility and gastric emptying.

## **Alternate Names**

Mosapride is also known as Mosapride Citrate or Mosapride Citrate Hydrate. Brand names include Gasmotin, Gutmovin,  GASTIIN CR, mosar®, mosar® plus, Mazt and MT PRIDE 5 among others.  International variations exist, such as Agimosarid (VN), Anamotin (KR, PH), and Biotonus (PE).

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Mosapride acts as a selective 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor agonist, primarily in the enteric nervous system of the gastrointestinal tract.  This action results in increased acetylcholine release, enhancing gastric emptying and promoting coordinated peristaltic activity in the stomach and small intestine.  

**Pharmacokinetics:** Mosapride is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 0.5 to 1.4 hours. It has a volume of distribution of 1.7 to 3.5 L/kg and is approximately 97-99% bound to plasma proteins.  Mosapride is metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP3A4, with its main metabolite being the des-4-fluorobenzyl compound.  It is eliminated through both renal and hepatic pathways, with approximately 1% excreted unchanged in urine and 10% excreted as the active metabolite. The elimination half-life of mosapride is 1.4–2.5 hours, and around 4.3 hours for the metabolite.

**Mode of Action:** Mosapride selectively binds to and activates 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors located on presynaptic cholinergic neurons in the myenteric plexus. This activation enhances acetylcholine release, causing increased gastric motility and peristalsis.

**Elimination Pathways:** Excretion occurs via both urine and feces. Less than 1% of an administered dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug, while around 7% is excreted as its main metabolite (des-4-fluorobenzyl mosapride).


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
The standard adult dosage is 5 mg three times daily, taken orally before or after meals.  The maximum daily dosage should not exceed 15 mg.

#### **Children:**
The safety and efficacy of Mosapride in pediatric patients have not been established.  There are no officially established pediatric dosage recommendations.  Unofficial sources suggest 0.3 mg/kg/day in 2-3 divided doses, but this should be approached cautiously.  


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Due to potential age-related decline in hepatic and renal function, a lower starting dose of 2.5 mg three times daily (7.5mg/day) is recommended for elderly patients.  Close monitoring is essential, and further dose adjustments may be necessary.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  In patients with renal impairment, caution is warranted, and starting dose should not exceed 2.5 mg three times a day. Closely monitor for adverse effects. Specific dosage recommendations are limited.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** In patients with hepatic impairment, a reduced starting dose of 2.5 mg three times daily (7.5mg/day) is recommended. Closely monitor the patient's condition, since mosapride is metabolized in the liver.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  In patients with comorbid conditions, exercise caution and adjust the dosage as needed.


### **Clinical Use Cases**
There are no specific dosage recommendations for the listed clinical scenarios (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, and Emergency Situations). Mosapride's primary use is for functional dyspepsia and GERD. It is occasionally used as an adjunct treatment prior to barium enema X-ray examinations. The dosage in such cases would generally align with the standard adult dose, with adjustments made based on patient-specific factors.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modification is crucial for elderly patients, those with renal or hepatic dysfunction, and those with specific metabolic disorders or genetic polymorphisms that may affect drug metabolism.  Start with a lower dose and titrate based on clinical response and tolerance.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
Diarrhea, dry mouth, abdominal pain/cramps, headache, dizziness, malaise, insomnia, nausea, unusual tiredness and weakness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Fulminant hepatitis, serious hepatic dysfunction (accompanied by a marked increase in AST, ALT, and γ-GTP), jaundice (some cases fatal), QT interval prolongation, irregular heartbeat.

### **Long-Term Effects**
Data on long-term complications from prolonged Mosapride use is limited, but rodent studies have shown an increased risk of liver (hepatocellular adenoma) and thyroid (follicular cell adenoma) tumors at very high doses. Therefore, prolonged use without clear clinical benefit is not advised.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Serious ADRs include fulminant hepatitis, hepatic dysfunction, and jaundice, which may be fatal. QT interval prolongation and severe hypersensitivity reactions are also possible.


## **Contraindications**

Mosapride is contraindicated in patients with:

- Known hypersensitivity to Mosapride or any component of the formulation.
- Gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction, or perforation.
- Patients with a history of QT interval prolongation or other significant cardiac arrhythmias.



## **Drug Interactions**

Mosapride is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin) may increase Mosapride plasma levels. Concomitant administration with CYP3A4 inducers may decrease its efficacy.  Anticholinergic agents may attenuate Mosapride's prokinetic effects. Monitor closely when using with drugs that prolong the QT interval (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol). Interactions with some antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol) have also been reported. Avoid alcohol, smoking, and grapefruit juice as these may alter drug levels or increase the risk of side effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
The safety of Mosapride during pregnancy has not been established.  Use only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the fetus. Mosapride is excreted in breast milk.  Avoid Mosapride during breastfeeding or discontinue breastfeeding if Mosapride therapy is essential.
