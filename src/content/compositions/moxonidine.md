## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Moxonidine is primarily prescribed for the treatment of essential or primary hypertension (high blood pressure).
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Centrally acting antihypertensive agent, Imidazoline receptor agonist.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Moxonidine acts by stimulating imidazoline receptors in the brainstem.  This leads to a decrease in sympathetic nervous system activity, reducing peripheral vascular resistance and lowering blood pressure.  It does not affect cardiac output or impair hemodynamic reflexes.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely used alternate generic names.
- **Brand Names:** Physiotens, Moxogamma, Moxonidin


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Moxonidine decreases sympathetic nervous system activity, leading to vasodilation and reduced peripheral vascular resistance, thereby lowering blood pressure. It does not significantly affect heart rate or cardiac output.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Moxonidine is well absorbed after oral administration. Food does not affect its absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Moxonidine undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily excreted unchanged through renal tubular secretion with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 2.5 hours. 
- **Mode of Action:** Moxonidine is a selective agonist of imidazoline I<sub>1</sub>-receptors in the rostral ventrolateral medulla of the brainstem. Stimulation of these receptors inhibits sympathetic outflow, leading to vasodilation and reduced blood pressure. It has minimal binding affinity for Î±<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors, which contributes to its reduced incidence of side effects like sedation and dry mouth compared to other centrally acting antihypertensives.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Initial dose:** 200 mcg once daily in the morning.
- **Titration:** If the therapeutic effect is insufficient after 3 weeks, the dose can be increased to 400 mcg daily, either as a single morning dose or divided into two doses (morning and evening).  
- **Maximum dose:** After another 3 weeks, if further blood pressure control is needed, the dose can be increased to a maximum of 600 mcg/day, administered in divided doses (morning and evening). The maximum single dose should not exceed 400 mcg, and the maximum daily dose is 600 mcg.

#### **Children:**

- Moxonidine is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 16 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Same as adult dosing, provided renal function is not impaired. Close monitoring is recommended.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    - **Moderate impairment (GFR 30-60 mL/min):** Initial dose 200 mcg daily, maximum dose 400 mcg daily.
    - **Severe impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min):** Initial dose 200 mcg daily, maximum dose 300 mcg daily.  Moxonidine is contraindicated in patients with a creatinine clearance <30 mL/min. 
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended, but caution should be exercised.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with 1st-degree AV block, severe coronary artery disease, angina pectoris, poor circulation or heart failure.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  
Moxonidine's clinical use is limited to the treatment of essential hypertension. It is not indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary in patients with renal impairment as described above. Careful monitoring of blood pressure and side effects is crucial, especially at the start of therapy and during dose titration.


## **Side Effects**

- Vomiting
- Orthostatic hypotension

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Bradycardia
- Severe hypotension
- Syncope
- Angioedema
- Atrioventricular block
- Skin reactions (rash, itching, swelling)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Limited data available on long-term effects.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Angioedema

- Atrioventricular block


## **Contraindications**

- 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular block
- Bradycardia (resting heart rate < 50 bpm)
- Severe heart failure (NYHA Class I-IV)
- Severe renal impairment (GFR < 30 mL/min)
- History of angioneurotic edema

## **Drug Interactions**

- **Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs):** May reduce the antihypertensive effect of moxonidine.
- **Benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants:** May enhance the sedative effects of moxonidine.
- **Beta-blockers:**  Concurrent use may lead to excessive bradycardia and hypotension.  If discontinuing combination therapy, beta-blockers should be withdrawn first, followed by moxonidine a few days later to minimize the risk of rebound hypertension.
- **Other antihypertensive medications:** Additive hypotensive effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  There is no adequate data for the use of moxonidine in pregnant women. Animal studies have shown potential risks.  Moxonidine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.
- **Breastfeeding:** Moxonidine is excreted in breast milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking moxonidine.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Imidazoline I<sub>1</sub> receptor agonist, reducing sympathetic outflow.
- **Side Effects:** Dry mouth, dizziness, headache, fatigue, sleepiness, nausea, vomiting. Rarely, bradycardia, hypotension, syncope, angioedema, AV block.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, sick sinus syndrome, 2nd/3rd degree AV block, bradycardia, severe heart failure, severe renal impairment, angioedema history.
- **Drug Interactions:** TCAs, benzodiazepines, beta-blockers, other antihypertensives.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Avoid use unless absolutely necessary.
- **Dosage:**  Initial 200 mcg/day, titrate to maximum 600 mcg/day in divided doses.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, heart rate, renal function, symptoms of hypotension.


## **Popular Combinations**

Moxonidine can be combined with other antihypertensive agents like thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers when monotherapy is insufficient. However, dose adjustments and close monitoring are necessary. Co-administration with beta-blockers should be approached with caution. 

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess renal function, cardiac history and current medication use before initiating therapy. Monitor blood pressure regularly, especially during dose titration.
- **Specific Populations:**  See above for dosage adjustments in patients with renal impairment and elderly individuals.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Alcohol may potentiate the sedative effects of moxonidine.
