      How does Mulberry extract help manage blood sugar levels?**


      **A:**  It inhibits alpha-glucosidase, slowing down carbohydrate digestion
      and absorption, which helps prevent post-meal blood sugar spikes.

## **Usage**

- Mulberry extract, derived from the leaves of the *Morus alba* (white mulberry) tree, is primarily used for its potential antidiabetic properties, aiding in the management of type 2 diabetes by helping to regulate blood sugar levels. It's also explored for its potential benefits in managing cholesterol and weight, and for its antioxidant properties.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Hypoglycemic agent, antioxidant.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Mulberry extract inhibits alpha-glucosidase, an enzyme that breaks down complex carbohydrates into glucose in the small intestine. This action slows down glucose absorption, preventing postprandial hyperglycemia (a spike in blood sugar levels after meals).

## **Alternate Names**

- White Mulberry Leaf Extract
- *Morus alba* Leaf Extract
- Sang-Ye
- Sohakuhi
- Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Mulberry extract primarily exerts its effect by inhibiting alpha-glucosidase, reducing postprandial glucose absorption.  It also exhibits antioxidant activity.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** While precise pharmacokinetic data is limited, studies suggest that mulberry leaf extract's active components, including 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract.  The metabolic fate and elimination pathways are not fully elucidated.
- **Mode of Action:** DNJ is a potent inhibitor of alpha-glucosidase. It competitively binds to the enzyme's active site, preventing the breakdown of complex carbohydrates into absorbable glucose.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Not fully elucidated.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- 0.8-1 gram of white mulberry leaf powder or extract three times daily, taken before meals, has been used in studies.
- 250-750 mg of mulberry leaf extract once or twice daily is a common dosage recommendation for supplements.


#### **Children:**
- Not enough information is available to establish a standard dosage for children. Use with caution.

#### **Special Cases:**

### **Clinical Use Cases**
-  The current evidence primarily supports the use of mulberry extract as an oral supplement for managing blood sugar in type 2 diabetes. Dosage in other clinical settings is not established.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
- Dosage modifications should be based on individual patient response, blood glucose control, and potential drug interactions. Consult with a healthcare professional.
