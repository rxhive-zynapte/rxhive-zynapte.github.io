## **Usage**

Mycobacterium w (Mw), also known as Mycobacterium indicus pranii, is an immunotherapeutic agent primarily used in the treatment of leprosy, particularly in lepromin-negative patients.  It is also used as an adjuvant therapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing chemotherapy with paclitaxel and cisplatin, and for the treatment of sepsis.

## **Alternate Names**

* Mycobacterium indicus pranii
* Sepsivac (brand name)

## **How It Works**

Mycobacterium w is a heat-killed preparation of the bacterium. Its mechanism of action involves modulating the host's immune response.  Specifically, it acts as a toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 agonist, stimulating innate immunity and reducing the inflammatory response.  It is thought to enhance bacterial clearance and restore immune system function, especially in immunocompromised individuals.  Pharmacokinetic studies on its absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion haven't been widely conducted as it is administered intradermally by a healthcare professional, primarily in hospital settings.  Information regarding receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation is not available in the provided literature.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**  

#### **Adults:**  

* **Leprosy:** 0.1 mL intradermally in the deltoid region of each arm initially, followed by 0.1 mL in one deltoid region every 3 months for 2 years (total 8 doses) along with multi-drug therapy (MDT).
* **NSCLC:** 0.2 mL intradermally (0.1 mL in each arm) one week before chemotherapy initiation, followed by 0.1 mL in the deltoid region during the 2nd and 3rd week of each chemotherapy cycle (Paclitaxel and Cisplatin) for a total of four cycles. Continue monthly administration until 12 months from treatment start.
* **Severe Sepsis:** 0.3 mL intradermally (0.1 mL in three different sites) daily for three days (total 0.9 mL). Recommended age range is 18-65 years.

#### **Children:**  

Pediatric dosage information is not explicitly mentioned in the provided literature.

#### **Special Cases:**  

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments are not specifically mentioned in the provided literature, although intravenous administration has been found to be safe in elderly patients with sepsis.
* **Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment:** Dosage modifications haven't been provided in the current sources.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Contraindicated in patients undergoing chemotherapy other than the recommended regimen for NSCLC.  Caution advised in patients with skin conditions. Choose a site free from lesions if eczema exists.



### **Clinical Use Cases**  

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, and ICU use, beyond sepsis, have not been provided in the given literature.

### **Dosage Adjustments**  

Specific dosage adjustments based on individual patient factors have not been mentioned in the provided literature.

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**  
Injection site reactions: erythema, induration, ulceration, nodule formation, local hypersensitivity. Systemic effects: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pain, weakness, loss of appetite.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**  
Large ulcers, abscesses at the injection site (mostly due to improper injection technique), generalized granulomatous dermatitis.



### **Long-Term Effects**  
Atrophic scarring at the injection site.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Anaphylactic reactions, though rare, have been reported.



## **Contraindications**

* History of allergic reactions to Mycobacterium w or its excipients.
* Fever.
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* Generalized septic skin conditions.
* Chronic debilitating conditions other than the indicated conditions.
* Concurrent chemotherapy (other than the specified regimen for NSCLC).

## **Drug Interactions**
No significant drug-drug interactions have been reported.  It has been administered concurrently with cytotoxic and anti-leprosy drugs without known interactions.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding. It is unknown if Mycobacterium w is excreted in breast milk.


## **Drug Profile Summary**  

* **Mechanism of Action:** Immunomodulator, TLR-2 agonist.
* **Side Effects:** Injection site reactions, gastrointestinal issues, hearing impairment.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, fever, pregnancy, breastfeeding, skin conditions, concurrent chemotherapy.
* **Drug Interactions:** None reported.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
* **Dosage:** See detailed dosage section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor injection site, vital signs, and symptoms of infection.


## **Popular Combinations**
* Paclitaxel and Cisplatin (in NSCLC)
* Multi-drug therapy (MDT) in leprosy

## **Precautions**
* Administer strictly intradermally.
* Ensure appropriate training for administration.
* Monitor injection site for reactions.
* Screen for contraindications.
