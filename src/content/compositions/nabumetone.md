## **Usage**

Nabumetone is prescribed for the relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.  It is pharmacologically classified as a Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID). Specifically, it's a non-acidic NSAID prodrug. Nabumetone itself has minimal direct effects; its active metabolite, 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (6-MNA), inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and thereby diminishing inflammation and pain.

## **Alternate Names**

While "nabumetone" is the generic name, it's marketed under various brand names such as Relafen®, Relafen DS®, and others internationally.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Nabumetone is a prodrug; after oral administration, it undergoes rapid hepatic metabolism to 6-MNA. 6-MNA exerts its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, thus suppressing prostaglandin synthesis.  This action reduces inflammation and pain at the peripheral sites of injury or inflammation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:**  Nabumetone is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Food may slightly delay absorption but does not affect overall bioavailability.
* **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily via oxidation by CYP1A2 and CYP2C9, to 6-MNA, its active metabolite.
* **Elimination:** 6-MNA is primarily eliminated via renal excretion (approximately 80%), and a small portion undergoes biliary excretion. The elimination half-life of 6-MNA is approximately 24 hours in young adults, and may be prolonged in elderly patients (around 30 hours).


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Initial dose: 1000 mg orally once a day, preferably at bedtime.
Maintenance dose: 1500 mg to 2000 mg orally per day, as a single daily dose or in two divided doses (every 12 hours).
Maximum dose: 2000 mg/day.

#### **Children:**

Nabumetone is generally not recommended for pediatric patients under 18 years of age.  Limited research suggests 30 mg/kg/day (up to a maximum of 2000 mg/day) may be used in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, but this is not a standard approved indication.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lowest effective dose (e.g., 1000 mg/day) and titrate cautiously. Close monitoring for adverse events is crucial due to increased risk in elderly individuals.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** 
    * Mild renal impairment (CrCl ≥ 50 mL/min): No dosage adjustment is typically needed.
    * Moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30-49 mL/min): Initial dose: 750 mg/day; maximum dose: 1500 mg/day.
    * Severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min): Initial dose: 500 mg/day; maximum dose: 1000 mg/day.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Start with the lowest effective dose and titrate cautiously. Close monitoring is recommended.  In severe hepatic impairment or active liver disease, nabumetone is contraindicated.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with heart disease, hypertension, history of GI bleeding, or other relevant conditions.  Individualized dosage adjustments may be required.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Nabumetone is not typically indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary indication is for managing chronic pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Other NSAIDs or analgesics may be more appropriate for acute pain management in these settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment as outlined above.  Consider lower initial doses and cautious titration in elderly patients. In patients with certain comorbid conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes), careful monitoring and potential dosage adjustments are necessary. Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism are not routinely tested for, but may influence individual responses and necessitate tailored dosing.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Diarrhea, indigestion/heartburn, abdominal pain, constipation, dizziness, edema (swelling), flatulence, headache, nausea, positive stool guaiac, skin itching, rash, tinnitus, dry mouth, fatigue.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, heart failure, gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation,  hepatotoxicity, serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome), anaphylaxis, renal impairment.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic use of nabumetone can contribute to gastrointestinal issues, including ulcers and bleeding, cardiovascular complications, and renal dysfunction.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Clinically significant ADRs include GI bleeding, acute renal failure, severe allergic reactions, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, hepatotoxicity, myocardial infarction, and stroke.  These require immediate medical intervention.



## **Contraindications**

* **Absolute:**  Aspirin allergy or hypersensitivity to other NSAIDs; severe renal impairment; perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery; severe hepatic impairment or active liver disease; pregnancy (third trimester).
* **Relative:** History of peptic ulcer disease; gastrointestinal bleeding; stomatitis; systemic lupus erythematosus; ulcerative colitis; congestive heart failure; hypertension; asthma; fluid retention; coagulopathies; pregnancy (first and second trimesters); breastfeeding.


## **Drug Interactions**

Nabumetone can interact with numerous medications.
* **Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin):** Increased risk of bleeding.
* **Antihypertensives (e.g., ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, diuretics):** Reduced antihypertensive effect.
* **Aspirin and other NSAIDs:** Increased risk of GI adverse events.
* **Corticosteroids:** Increased risk of GI ulceration and bleeding.
* **Lithium:** Increased lithium levels.
* **Methotrexate:** Increased methotrexate toxicity.
* **Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs):** Increased risk of GI bleeding.
* **CYP450 interactions:** Nabumetone is metabolized by CYP1A2 and CYP2C9.  Inhibitors of these enzymes (e.g., fluconazole, ciprofloxacin) can increase nabumetone levels, while inducers (e.g., rifampin, smoking) can decrease levels.

It's also important to be aware of potential interactions with OTC drugs, supplements (e.g., herbal remedies), alcohol, and certain foods (e.g., grapefruit juice). Always review a patient's full medication list and assess for potential interactions before prescribing nabumetone.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Nabumetone is contraindicated during the third trimester due to the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and potential complications during delivery.  Use during the first and second trimesters should be carefully considered and only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:**  It is unknown if nabumetone is excreted in breast milk. Due to potential adverse effects in nursing infants, it is generally recommended to avoid nabumetone during breastfeeding. If use is deemed essential, an alternative safer option or discontinuation of breastfeeding may be considered.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  NSAID prodrug; active metabolite 6-MNA inhibits COX-1 and COX-2, reducing prostaglandin synthesis.
* **Side Effects:** Common: GI upset, dizziness, headache. Serious: GI bleeding, cardiovascular events, renal impairment.
