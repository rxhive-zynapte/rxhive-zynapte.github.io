## **Usage**

- Nadifloxacin is prescribed for the topical treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris (papulopustular acne, grades I-II) and bacterial skin infections like impetigo and folliculitis. It can also treat secondary infections in chronic dermatoses such as eczema and dermatitis.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Topical Fluoroquinolone antibiotic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Nadifloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and transcription. This inhibition prevents bacterial growth and multiplication, effectively managing bacterial skin infections.

## **Alternate Names**

- Acuatim
- Nadiflox
- Nadoxin
- Nadixa
- Activon

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Nadifloxacin exerts a bactericidal effect by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.  This prevents bacterial DNA replication and transcription. It also exhibits some anti-inflammatory properties.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Following topical application, systemic absorption is minimal. After a single topical application of 10g of 1% cream, the peak plasma concentration is around 107 ng/mL, with a half-life of approximately 19.4 hours.  About 0.09% of the applied dose is excreted in urine within 48 hours. With repeated application (5g twice daily for 7 days), steady-state plasma concentration is reached around day 5, with a peak of 4.1 ng/mL and a half-life of 23.2 hours. Urinary excretion reaches about 0.16% by day 7.
- **Mode of Action:**  Nadifloxacin targets bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, inhibiting their activity and preventing bacterial DNA replication and transcription, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily metabolized hepatically and excreted in the urine.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer to the affected area twice daily (morning and evening) or as directed by a physician.

#### **Children:** Not recommended for use in children younger than 14 years.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are typically necessary. However, caution should be exercised due to the potential for age-related decline in hepatic and renal function.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No specific dosage adjustments are indicated based on current data.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments are indicated based on current data. However, monitor for potential QT prolongation due to metabolic disturbances related to hepatic insufficiency.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution should be exercised in patients with conditions that might exacerbate skin reactions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Not typically indicated for systemic use, therefore, it is not relevant in cases of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
- No dose adjustments are generally required based on patient-specific factors other than renal/hepatic impairment and age.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

- Itching
- Burning sensation
- Dryness
- Irritation
- Redness

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, or swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)

### **Long-Term Effects:**
- Not well established, as the medication is typically used for short-term treatment.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
- Severe allergic reactions as described above.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to nadifloxacin, other quinolones, or any component of the formulation.
- History of tendonitis or tendon rupture associated with fluoroquinolone use.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Topical medications with irritant properties like benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid may exacerbate skin irritation.
- Due to minimal systemic absorption, interactions with systemically administered drugs are unlikely.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Not formally categorized. Animal studies haven't revealed teratogenic effects, but human data is limited. Use only if absolutely necessary and after careful risk-benefit assessment by a physician.
- **Breastfeeding:** Nadifloxacin is excreted in breast milk.  Avoid use during breastfeeding or discontinue breastfeeding if nadifloxacin is necessary.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.
- **Side Effects:** Itching, burning, dryness, irritation, redness. Rarely, allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to nadifloxacin or other quinolones, history of fluoroquinolone-associated tendinopathy.
- **Drug Interactions:**  Topical irritants. Systemic interactions unlikely.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution.  Limited human data. Excreted in breast milk.
- **Dosage:**  Topical application twice daily.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor the affected skin area for signs of improvement or adverse reactions.



## **Popular Combinations**

- Typically not used in combination with other topical agents due to the risk of increased irritation.  Combination with corticosteroids may be prescribed in certain cases of infected inflammatory dermatoses, under strict medical supervision.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Avoid contact with eyes, mucous membranes, and broken skin. Wash hands thoroughly after application.
- **Specific Populations:**
    - **Pregnant Women:** Use only if absolutely necessary and under close medical supervision.
    - **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Avoid use or discontinue breastfeeding.
    - **Children & Elderly:**  Not recommended for children under 14.  Use with caution in the elderly.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** No specific lifestyle restrictions, except for sun exposure, which should be limited due to a potential risk of photosensitivity.
