## **Usage**

- Naftopidil is prescribed for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland.  It is specifically indicated for the relief of dysuria (painful urination) in men with BPH.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist (alpha-blocker).

- **Mechanism of Action:** Naftopidil selectively blocks alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, predominantly the alpha-1D subtype located in the prostate and bladder. This action relaxes the smooth muscles in the lower urinary tract, thus improving urine flow and reducing BPH-related symptoms.  It also exhibits some affinity for 5-HT1A serotonin receptors, which can suppress bladder contractions and improve nocturia.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely used alternate names exist.

- **Brand Names:**  Nafodil, Flivas, etc. (Brand names can vary regionally.)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Naftopidil relaxes the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck by blocking alpha-1A adrenergic receptors, primarily the alpha-1D subtype, reducing urethral pressure and improving urine flow. Its secondary action on 5-HT1A receptors contributes to further alleviation of storage symptoms like nocturia.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Naftopidil is administered orally and well-absorbed.  It is metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 enzymes and excreted mainly in the bile.

- **Mode of Action:** Naftopidil competitively binds to alpha-1A adrenergic receptors, inhibiting the binding of norepinephrine and preventing smooth muscle contraction.

- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Alpha-1A adrenergic receptor blockade and some 5-HT1A receptor agonism.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism via CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, followed by biliary excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial: 25 mg once daily after a meal.
- Maintenance:  May be increased gradually (at 1-2 week intervals) to 50-75 mg once daily, adjusting according to symptoms.  Maximum dose is 75 mg/day.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary, starting with a lower dose and titrating cautiously.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised, especially in severe renal impairment.  Dose reduction might be considered.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.  Caution is advised in moderate hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, orthostatic hypotension, or salt imbalance.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Naftopidil is not typically indicated for use in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its primary indication is for BPH/LUTS management in an outpatient setting.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjust dosage based on individual response and tolerability.
- Consider renal and hepatic function, cardiovascular status, and concomitant medications.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Dizziness/Lightheadedness
- Orthostatic Hypotension
- Headache
- Nausea/Vomiting
- Gastrointestinal discomfort
- Nasal congestion
- Fatigue


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, hives, angioedema)
- Severe hypotension
- Syncope

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Limited data available on long-term effects.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Severe allergic reactions
- Hepatic dysfunction (rare)


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to naftopidil
- Severe hepatic impairment
- Use in women (especially pregnant or breastfeeding)

## **Drug Interactions**

- Other alpha-blockers (increased risk of hypotension)
- Antihypertensives (additive hypotensive effects)
- CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin) - may increase naftopidil levels
- CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampicin, carbamazepine) - may decrease naftopidil levels
- Alcohol (may increase dizziness and drowsiness)

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Not established, contraindicated in women.
- Naftopidil is present in semen. Men should use condoms, especially if their partner is pregnant.

- **Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Alpha-1A adrenergic receptor antagonist, especially alpha-1D subtype, relaxing smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder.
- **Side Effects:** Dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, headache, nausea, fatigue.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe hepatic impairment, use in women.
- **Drug Interactions:** Other alpha-blockers, antihypertensives, CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers, alcohol.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
- **Dosage:** 25-75 mg once daily.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, liver function tests (if indicated).


## **Popular Combinations**

- Not typically used in combination therapy for BPH.  May be used with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors in some cases, though clinical benefits of the combination are not fully established.


## **Precautions**

- Monitor blood pressure, especially at initiation and after dose adjustments.
- Evaluate hepatic and renal function in patients with existing impairments.
- Advise patients about potential for dizziness and orthostatic hypotension, especially when standing up from a lying or sitting position.
- Caution patients about operating machinery or driving.
