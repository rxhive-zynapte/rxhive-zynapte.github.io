## **Usage**

- Nalidixic acid is prescribed for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by susceptible gram-negative bacteria like *E. coli*, *Proteus*, *Klebsiella*, *Enterobacter*, *Salmonella*, and *Shigella* spp. It is also used to treat shigellosis (bacillary dysentery).
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Quinolone antibiotic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Nalidixic acid inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair. This inhibition leads to bacterial cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:**  The name Nalidixic Acid itself is widely recognized.
- **Brand Names:** NegGram, WIN 18,320, Nadix, Dix, Negamet, Negadix KT, Abdogyl-N, Gramoneg.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Nalidixic acid exerts its bactericidal effect by inhibiting bacterial DNA synthesis. Its primary target is DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) and topoisomerase IV, enzymes crucial for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, and repair.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1-2 hours. Food can delay absorption but not bioavailability.
    - **Distribution:** Distributed widely in the body and crosses the placenta. It also enters breast milk.  93% protein bound (nalidixic acid), 63% protein bound (hydroxynalidixic acid).
    - **Metabolism:** Partially metabolized in the liver to its active metabolite, hydroxynalidixic acid, which accounts for a significant portion of the drug's antibacterial activity in the urine.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated via renal excretion (80-90% as inactive metabolites). A small amount is excreted in feces. Elimination half-life is 1-2.5 hours in individuals with normal renal function, but it can be prolonged in patients with renal impairment.
- **Mode of Action:** Nalidixic acid's active metabolite, hydroxynalidixic acid, binds strongly, but reversibly, to bacterial DNA. This interaction interferes with the action of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, ultimately blocking DNA replication and transcription, leading to bacterial cell death.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Nalidixic acid primarily acts through enzyme inhibition (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV).
- **Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly renal excretion, with some fecal excretion.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Initial Therapy:** 1 g orally four times daily for 1-2 weeks (total daily dose 4 g).
- **Long-Term Therapy:** 2 g orally daily (total daily dose) after the initial treatment period.

#### **Children (over 3 months):**

- **Initial Therapy:** 55 mg/kg/day orally in four divided doses for 1-2 weeks. Maximum dose not to exceed adult dose of 4g/day.
- **Long-Term Therapy:** 33 mg/kg/day orally in four divided doses after initial therapy. Maximum dose not to exceed adult dose of 2g/day.
- **Prophylaxis:** 15 mg/kg twice daily.



#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose reduction may be necessary due to age-related decline in renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce dosage based on creatinine clearance. If creatinine clearance is greater than 20 mL/minute, use the standard dose. If less than 20 mL/minute, halve the standard dosage.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction may be considered.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  Dosage guidelines specifically for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations are not explicitly defined for Nalidixic Acid.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustment should be based on renal function, hepatic function, and age.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
- Photosensitivity reactions (sunburn)
- Headache, dizziness, drowsiness
- Rash, pruritus, urticaria


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Convulsions, intracranial hypertension (particularly in infants and young children)
- Toxic psychoses, hallucinations
- Peripheral neuropathy, muscular weakness, myalgia
- Cholestatic jaundice
- Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia
- Erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, anaphylactoid reactions

### **Long-Term Effects**

With prolonged use, the risk of some side effects like peripheral neuropathy might increase. 



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to nalidixic acid or any quinolone antibiotic

## **Drug Interactions**

- Antacids (containing calcium, magnesium, or aluminum), sucralfate, multivitamins with zinc, iron supplements: Reduce absorption of nalidixic acid. Administer 2 hours before or after these medications.
- Warfarin: Nalidixic acid can potentiate warfarinâ€™s anticoagulant effects. Monitor INR closely.
- Probenecid: May reduce renal clearance of nalidixic acid, increasing the risk of toxicity.
- Didanosine: Chewable/buffered tablets and pediatric powders for oral solution reduce nalidixic acid absorption. Co-administration is contraindicated.
- Other drugs metabolized by the liver: Potential for altered metabolism.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Should be avoided, especially during the first trimester. There is a potential risk of cartilage damage.
- **Breastfeeding:** Nalidixic acid is excreted in breast milk.  The risk-benefit ratio should be carefully considered before use in lactating mothers.
