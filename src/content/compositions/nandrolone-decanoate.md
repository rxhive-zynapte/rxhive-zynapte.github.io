## **Usage**

Nandrolone Decanoate is an anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) primarily prescribed for:

* **Osteoporosis** (loss of bone tissue) in postmenopausal women
* **Certain types of anemia**, such as anemia of chronic renal failure and aplastic anemia
* **Wasting syndromes** (cachexia) associated with chronic illness or severe injury, including AIDS-related wasting
* **In the past**: Palliative treatment of inoperable breast cancer (in women)

It has also been used off-label for promoting muscle growth and strength, but these uses are not generally recommended due to the potential for adverse effects.

**Pharmacological Classification**: Anabolic-androgenic steroid.

**Mechanism of Action**: Nandrolone Decanoate binds to androgen receptors in target tissues, including bone and skeletal muscle. This binding promotes protein synthesis, leading to increased muscle mass and bone growth. It also stimulates erythropoiesis (red blood cell production) in the bone marrow.


## **Alternate Names**

* **Generic Name**: Nandrolone Decanoate
* **Other Names**: 19-Nortestosterone decanoate,  Deca
* **Brand Names**: Deca-Durabolin, Rolon, others.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics**: Nandrolone Decanoate exerts its effects by binding to androgen receptors. This binding leads to increased protein synthesis, nitrogen retention, and calcium deposition in bone. In the bone marrow, it stimulates erythropoietin production, which in turn promotes red blood cell formation.

**Pharmacokinetics**:
* **Absorption**: After intramuscular injection, the drug is slowly released from the oily depot and absorbed into the systemic circulation.
* **Metabolism**: Nandrolone decanoate is converted to its active metabolite, nandrolone. Nandrolone is further metabolized in the liver primarily via 5Î±-reductase to 3-norandrosterone and other metabolites.
* **Elimination**: Metabolites are excreted primarily in the urine, with a small amount eliminated in the feces. The elimination half-life is approximately 6 days.


**Mode of Action**:
Binds to androgen receptors in target cells, translocates to the nucleus, and interacts with DNA to regulate gene expression, promoting protein synthesis and other anabolic effects.

**Receptor Binding**:  Androgen receptor agonist.

**Elimination Pathways**: Primarily hepatic metabolism with renal excretion of metabolites.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Anaemia associated with Chronic Renal Failure**:
    * Females: 50-100 mg intramuscularly once a week.
    * Males: 100-200 mg intramuscularly once a week.
* **Osteoporosis**: 50mg intramuscularly every 2-4 weeks.
* **Other indications**: 25-50mg every 2-3 weeks. Higher dosages may be initiated and gradually reduced as needed.

Discontinue if no hematologic improvement is seen in anemia within six months.

#### **Children:**

* **2-13 years (anemia associated with chronic renal disease)**: 25-50 mg intramuscularly every 3-4 weeks.
* **Safety and efficacy not well-established in children**. Prepubertal children should be monitored carefully for potential effects on growth and development. Not recommended in children below the age of 3 years due to presence of benzyl alcohol as an excipient.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Dosage adjustments may be required depending on organ function and individual response. Start with lower doses.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution advised. Close monitoring is necessary. Dose adjustments may be required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution advised. Close monitoring of liver function is essential. Dose reduction may be required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Individualized dosing is required. Consider potential drug interactions and the patient's overall health status.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Nandrolone Decanoate is **not typically used** in the clinical settings of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on patient response, renal or hepatic function, and other factors. Therapy should ideally be intermittent to minimize the risk of adverse effects.

## **Drug Interactions**

Nandrolone Decanoate can interact with several medications, including:

* **Anticoagulants** (e.g., warfarin): Increased risk of bleeding.
* **Antidiabetic agents** (e.g., insulin):  May alter blood glucose control.
* **Corticosteroids**: Increased risk of fluid retention.
* **CYP3A4 substrates**: May affect the metabolism of these drugs.

Interactions may also occur with other drugs, OTC medications, supplements, and food. Consult a comprehensive drug interaction database for a detailed list. Alcohol consumption should be avoided or limited.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category**: X (Contraindicated). Nandrolone Decanoate can cause virilization of the female fetus.
