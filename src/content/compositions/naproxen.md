## **Usage**

Naproxen is prescribed for various medical conditions, primarily to alleviate pain and reduce inflammation. These include:

* Osteoarthritis
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Ankylosing spondylitis
* Acute gout
* Bursitis
* Tendonitis
* Dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation)
* Acute musculoskeletal disorders
* Fever
* Headache, including migraine (off-label use)
* Postoperative pain

**Pharmacological Classification:** Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).

**Mechanism of Action:** Naproxen inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX), an enzyme responsible for producing prostaglandins, which mediate inflammation and pain. By reducing prostaglandin synthesis, naproxen diminishes pain signals and inflammatory responses.

## **Alternate Names**

Naproxen sodium (the sodium salt of naproxen)

**Brand Names:** Naprosyn, Anaprox, Aleve, Naprelan, and others.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Naproxen's primary therapeutic effects are analgesic (pain-relieving) and anti-inflammatory. It achieves this by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis via COX inhibition.  It may also have antipyretic (fever-reducing) effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Naproxen is well-absorbed orally.  The sodium salt (naproxen sodium) is absorbed more rapidly than naproxen base.  Naproxen is highly protein-bound in plasma.  It is metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 enzymes, and eliminated via renal excretion.  Naproxen has a relatively long half-life (around 12-15 hours), allowing for once or twice-daily dosing.

**Mode of Action:** Naproxen reversibly inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms. COX-1 is constitutively expressed and involved in physiological functions like protecting the gastric mucosa, while COX-2 is induced during inflammation. Inhibiting both contributes to naproxen's therapeutic and adverse effects.

**Elimination Pathways:** Naproxen is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism followed by renal excretion of the metabolites.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis:** 250-500 mg twice daily or 375-500 mg (delayed-release) twice daily.  May increase to 1500 mg/day for limited periods, if tolerated. Extended-release formulations: 750-1000 mg once daily; may increase to 1500 mg/day for limited periods.
* **Acute Musculoskeletal Disorders, Dysmenorrhea, Pain:** 500 mg initially, then 250 mg every 6-8 hours or 500 mg every 12 hours as needed. Maximum: 1250 mg on day 1, then 1000 mg/day. Extended-release: 750-1000 mg once daily, may increase to 1500 mg/day for a limited duration.
* **Acute Gout:** 750 mg initially, then 250 mg every 8 hours until the attack subsides. Or, 825 mg naproxen sodium initially followed by 275 mg every 8 hours.

#### **Children:**

* **Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (over 5 years):** 10 mg/kg/day divided twice daily.
* Use and dosage for other indications in children must be determined by a doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses due to increased risk of adverse effects and age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Lower doses are advised. Contraindicated in severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min).
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Lower doses are recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, or other relevant comorbidities. Dose adjustments might be necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of naproxen in clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, and ICU settings varies based on the patient's specific needs for pain and inflammation management, while considering the potential risks of NSAIDs in critically ill patients. Dosage should be determined based on the patient's condition. For specific dosage recommendations, consultation with resources like EMCrit (emcrit.org) is helpful. The information on EMCrit can be particularly relevant to Indian doctors who want to stay updated on the best practices in critical care management.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are required for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, elderly patients, and those with certain comorbid conditions.  Consider genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism, especially CYP2C9.  Always start with the lowest effective dose and titrate up based on patient response and tolerance.
