## Usage

- Naratriptan is prescribed for the **acute treatment of migraine attacks**, with or without aura. It is not intended for preventative use.
- **Pharmacological classification:**  Naratriptan is a 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptor agonist, belonging to the **triptan** class of antimigraine medications.
- **Mechanism of action:** Naratriptan selectively binds to 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors, primarily located on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves. This binding leads to vasoconstriction of cranial blood vessels and inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides, thus relieving migraine pain.


## Alternate Names

- **International or regional variations:** Naratriptanum (Latin).
- **Brand names:** Amerge, Naramig.


## How It Works

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Naratriptan's primary effect is the constriction of cranial blood vessels, reducing vasodilation believed to contribute to migraine pain. It also inhibits the release of vasoactive and pro-inflammatory neuropeptides like calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), further mitigating the migraine process.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Naratriptan is well-absorbed orally, with a bioavailability of approximately 70%. Food does not significantly affect absorption.
    - **Metabolism:**  Primarily metabolized in the liver, with a small contribution from CYP450 enzymes, making significant metabolic drug interactions unlikely.
    - **Elimination:** Mainly eliminated via renal excretion (approximately 60%), with about 30% as unchanged drug and 30% as inactive metabolites. The elimination half-life is approximately 6 hours.
- **Mode of action:** Naratriptan acts by selectively agonizing 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors.  This leads to:
    - **Vasoconstriction:**  Decreasing the dilation of cranial blood vessels, a key factor in migraine pain.
    - **Inhibition of trigeminal nerve activation:**  Blocking the release of CGRP and other pro-inflammatory neuropeptides that mediate pain transmission.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Primarily 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptor agonism. Minimal CYP450 enzyme involvement.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion, with some hepatic metabolism.



## Dosage

### Standard Dosage

#### Adults:

- Initial dose: 1 mg or 2.5 mg orally as a single dose.
- Repeat dose: If migraine returns, a second dose may be taken after 4 hours.
- Maximum dose: 5 mg in any 24-hour period.

#### Children:

- Naratriptan is not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established in this population.


#### Special Cases:

- **Elderly Patients (over 65 years):** Not recommended.  Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal and hepatic function and are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease, thus increasing the risk of adverse events.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    - Mild to moderate impairment: Initial dose of 1 mg, maximum daily dose of 2.5 mg.
    - Severe impairment (creatinine clearance <15 mL/min): Contraindicated.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
    - Mild to moderate impairment (Child-Pugh A or B): Initial dose of 1 mg, maximum daily dose of 2.5 mg.
    - Severe impairment (Child-Pugh C): Contraindicated.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or other significant cardiovascular risk factors.  Pre-treatment cardiovascular evaluation is recommended.


### Clinical Use Cases

Naratriptan is specifically indicated for the acute treatment of migraine headaches.  It is not indicated or recommended for the following:

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations** (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest)



### Dosage Adjustments

- Dose adjustments are necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment as described above.
- In elderly patients, careful dose selection is recommended, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, due to the higher likelihood of reduced organ function and concomitant diseases.



## Side Effects

### Common Side Effects:

- Dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue
- Paresthesia (numbness, tingling)
- Flushing
- Nausea
- Jaw, neck, or throat pain/tightness

### Rare but Serious Side Effects:

- Allergic reactions (angioedema, anaphylaxis)
- Myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary vasospasm
- Serotonin syndrome
- Peripheral vascular ischemia
- Ischemic bowel disease


### Long-Term Effects:

- Medication overuse headache can occur with frequent or excessive use of triptans.

### Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):

- Severe allergic reactions (requiring immediate medical attention)
- Chest pain, shortness of breath, irregular heartbeat (possible cardiac ischemia)
- Neurological symptoms (confusion, seizures, visual disturbances)


## Contraindications

- Hypersensitivity to naratriptan
- Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C)
- Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <15 mL/min)
- Ischemic heart disease, coronary vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina)
- History of stroke, TIA, hemiplegic or basilar migraine
- Peripheral vascular disease, ischemic bowel disease
- Uncontrolled hypertension
- Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders
- Concomitant use of ergot-containing drugs or other 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> agonists (within 24 hours)


## Drug Interactions

- **Ergot-containing drugs:** Contraindicated due to increased risk of vasospasm.
- **Other 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> agonists (triptans):** Contraindicated within 24 hours of naratriptan administration.
- **SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs:** Increased risk of serotonin syndrome. Close monitoring is required.
- **CYP450 interactions:** Minimal interaction anticipated due to limited metabolism via CYP450 enzymes.
- **Oral contraceptives:** May decrease naratriptan clearance.
- **Smoking:** May increase naratriptan clearance.


## Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (US FDA); B3 (Australian TGA). Animal studies have shown developmental toxicity. No adequate and well-controlled studies in humans. Use only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
- **Fetal risks:** Potential for embryolethality, fetal abnormalities, and growth retardation.
- **Breastfeeding:** Limited information available.  Breastfeeding should be avoided for 24 hours after administration. Consider alternate medications if possible.


## Drug Profile Summary

- **Mechanism of Action:** 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptor agonist, leading to vasoconstriction and inhibition of neuropeptide release.
- **Side Effects:** Dizziness, drowsiness, paresthesia, flushing, nausea, jaw/neck/throat pain.  Rarely: allergic reactions, cardiac events, serotonin syndrome.
