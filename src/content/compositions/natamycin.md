## **Usage**

Natamycin is an antifungal medication primarily used to treat fungal infections of the eye, including:

* **Fungal Keratitis:**  An infection of the cornea.
* **Fungal Blepharitis:** Inflammation of the eyelids.
* **Fungal Conjunctivitis:** Inflammation of the conjunctiva (the membrane lining the eyelids and covering the white part of the eye).

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antifungal Agent (Polyene macrolide antifungal)

**Mechanism of Action:** Natamycin binds to ergosterol, a major component of fungal cell membranes. This binding disrupts the integrity and function of the membrane, leading to cell death and effectively eliminating the fungal infection.

## **Alternate Names**

* **Pimaricin** (International Nonproprietary Name - INN)

**Brand Names:** Natacyn

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Natamycin exerts its antifungal action by binding to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane.  It does not bind to cholesterol in human cell membranes, resulting in selective toxicity against fungi.  This binding alters membrane permeability, causing leakage of essential cellular components and ultimately fungal cell death.  Natamycin is primarily fungicidal (kills fungi) but can be fungistatic (inhibits fungal growth) at lower concentrations.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Negligible systemic absorption after topical ophthalmic administration.
* **Metabolism:** Not applicable due to minimal systemic absorption.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated unchanged in the tears; minimal systemic elimination occurs.


**Mode of Action:** Binds to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane, altering permeability and leading to cell death.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Binds specifically to ergosterol.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily eliminated unchanged in tears after topical ophthalmic administration. Minimal systemic absorption occurs; therefore, systemic elimination pathways are not clinically relevant.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Fungal Keratitis:** Initially, 1 drop in the affected eye every 1-2 hours.  After 3-4 days, the frequency can be reduced to 1 drop 6-8 times daily.
* **Fungal Blepharitis/Conjunctivitis:** 1 drop in the affected eye 4-6 times daily.

Treatment duration is typically 14-21 days or until the infection is resolved.  In keratitis, a gradual dosage reduction over 4-7 days is often recommended.

#### **Children:**  Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients have not been established.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustments are generally needed.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustments are needed.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustments are needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific dosage adjustments based solely on comorbid conditions are generally required, but clinical judgment should be applied depending on the specific condition.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosages provided under "Standard Dosage" apply to typical clinical scenarios including intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific adjustments are needed for renal or hepatic impairment.  For other conditions, dosage adjustments may be considered based on individual patient factors and clinical judgment.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Eye irritation (redness, stinging, burning)
* Eye discomfort
* Foreign body sensation
* Increased tearing
* Blurred vision

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Allergic reactions (e.g., hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat)
* Worsening of eye infection



### **Long-Term Effects**

No specific long-term adverse effects have been reported with topical natamycin.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions represent a significant ADR and necessitate immediate discontinuation of the drug and appropriate medical management.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to natamycin or any component of the formulation.
* Concurrent use with topical corticosteroids may increase the spread of the fungal eye infection and should be avoided.

## **Drug Interactions**

No clinically significant drug interactions have been reported with topical ophthalmic natamycin due to its minimal systemic absorption.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Pregnancy Category C. While systemic absorption is minimal with topical ophthalmic use, it's unknown whether natamycin can cause fetal harm. It should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

* **Breastfeeding:** It is unknown if natamycin is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when administered to a nursing woman.  Discuss with the patient the risks and benefits of treatment vs. breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Binds to ergosterol in fungal cell membranes, causing cell death.
* **Side Effects:** Eye irritation, discomfort, tearing, blurred vision; rarely, allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to natamycin; concurrent use with topical corticosteroids.
* **Drug Interactions:** None reported.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution.  Category C.
* **Dosage:** Keratitis: Initially 1 drop every 1-2 hours, then reduce; other infections: 1 drop 4-6 times daily.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for resolution of infection, adverse reactions, and allergic reactions.

## **Popular Combinations**

Natamycin is typically used as a single agent.  Concurrent use with topical corticosteroids is contraindicated.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:**  Shake well before use. Avoid touching the dropper tip to any surface to prevent contamination. Discontinue contact lens wear during treatment. Monitor for treatment response.
* **Specific Populations:**  Use with caution during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Safety and efficacy in children have not been established.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Transient blurred vision may occur after administration, so caution should be exercised when driving or operating machinery.
