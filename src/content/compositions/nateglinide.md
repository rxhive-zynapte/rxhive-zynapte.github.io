      How does Nateglinide differ from sulfonylureas?**


      **A:** Nateglinide has a shorter duration of action and a different
      binding site on the beta-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel, leading to
      a more targeted effect on postprandial glucose and a potentially lower
      risk of hypoglycemia.

      How does Nateglinide work at the cellular level?**


      **A:** Nateglinide binds to a specific site on the ATP-sensitive potassium
      channels in pancreatic beta-cells. This binding inhibits the channel's
      activity, causing membrane depolarization and subsequent opening of
      voltage-gated calcium channels. The resulting influx of calcium triggers
      the release of insulin.

## **Usage**

- Nateglinide is prescribed for **type 2 diabetes mellitus** as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults.  It is specifically used to address postprandial hyperglycemia (elevated blood sugar after meals).
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Meglitinide, a short-acting insulin secretagogue.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Nateglinide stimulates insulin release from the pancreas by binding to and closing ATP-sensitive potassium channels on the pancreatic beta-cell membrane, leading to membrane depolarization and opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels. The influx of calcium triggers insulin secretion.

## **Alternate Names**

- International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Nateglinide
- **Brand Names:** Starlix is a popular brand name.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Nateglinide rapidly increases insulin secretion, starting within 20 minutes of oral administration and peaking around 1 hour post-dose.  The effect on insulin levels returns to baseline by 4 hours. This short duration of action makes it specifically effective in controlling postprandial glucose excursions.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Nateglinide is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. It is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 enzymes in the liver, and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine with a small amount excreted in the feces. The elimination half-life is approximately 1.5 hours.
- **Mode of Action:**  Nateglinide binds to a distinct site on the pancreatic beta-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel, different from the sulfonylurea binding site. This binding blocks the channel, leading to depolarization and ultimately, insulin secretion.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly hepatic metabolism via CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, followed by renal excretion of metabolites.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial: 120 mg three times daily before meals (within 1-30 minutes).
- Alternatively:  60 mg three times daily before meals for patients near their glycemic target (HbA1c) when starting treatment.
- Maximum: Information on maximum dosage not available through provided sources.
- Frequency: Three times daily before main meals.
- If a meal is skipped, the corresponding dose should also be skipped to prevent hypoglycemia.

#### **Children:**

- The safety and effectiveness of nateglinide in pediatric patients have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**
