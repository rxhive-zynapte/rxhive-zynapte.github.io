## **Usage**

Nelarabine is prescribed for the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) in adult and pediatric patients aged 1 year and older. It is used when the disease hasn't responded to or has relapsed after at least two other chemotherapy regimens.  Pharmacologically, nelarabine is classified as an antineoplastic antimetabolite, specifically a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor. Its mechanism of action involves being a prodrug of 9-β-D-arabinofuranosylguanine (ara-G). Nelarabine is demethylated to ara-G, which is then phosphorylated intracellularly to ara-G triphosphate (ara-GTP). Ara-GTP inhibits DNA polymerase, leading to DNA synthesis inhibition and apoptosis in T-cells.

## **Alternate Names**

The International Nonproprietary Name (INN) for nelarabine is "nelarabine".  A commonly known brand name is Arranon.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Nelarabine primarily affects rapidly dividing cells, particularly T-lymphoblasts.  Ara-G triphosphate (ara-GTP), the active metabolite, inhibits DNA polymerase and ribonucleotide reductase, disrupting DNA and RNA synthesis. This leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, especially in T-cells.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Nelarabine is administered intravenously and is rapidly demethylated to ara-G. Ara-G is then phosphorylated intracellularly to its active form, ara-GTP.  Peak plasma concentrations of ara-G are achieved at the end of infusion.  Nelarabine and ara-G are partially metabolized and excreted primarily through the kidneys.  Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes play a minor role in nelarabine's metabolism.

**Mode of Action:**  Nelarabine's mode of action involves intracellular conversion to ara-GTP, which competes with deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) for incorporation into DNA.  This leads to chain termination and inhibits DNA synthesis. Ara-GTP also inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, reducing the availability of dGTP.  These combined effects disrupt DNA replication and repair, leading to cell death.

**Elimination Pathways:** Nelarabine and its active metabolite, ara-G, are partially renally excreted and partially metabolized.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

1500 mg/m² administered intravenously over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5 of a 21-day cycle.

#### **Children (1 year and older):**

650 mg/m² administered intravenously over 1 hour daily for 5 consecutive days, repeated every 21 days.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustment is recommended, but close monitoring is advised due to potential age-related decrease in renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** For patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 50 mL/minute, no dosage adjustment is necessary.  For CrCl < 50 mL/minute, no data exists to guide dosing; close monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific dosage adjustment is available; close monitoring is necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor closely for potential drug interactions and adjust concomitant medications as needed.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Nelarabine's dosage is specifically designed for T-cell malignancies and doesn't vary based on clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. The standard dosage guidelines apply in these contexts.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage must be discontinued at the first sign of neurological events of NCI Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Event (NCI CTCAE) grade 2 or greater. Delaying subsequent doses can be considered for other toxicities, including hematologic toxicity.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, fatigue, fever, chills, headache, dizziness, peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling), decreased blood cell counts (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia), infections.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Severe neurological reactions (seizures, somnolence, confusion, motor weakness, paralysis), Guillain-Barré syndrome-like symptoms, tumor lysis syndrome, severe infections.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic peripheral neuropathy, secondary malignancies.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe neurotoxicity, rhabdomyolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to nelarabine, concurrent intrathecal chemotherapy or craniospinal radiation.

## **Drug Interactions**

Pentostatin, other myelosuppressive agents, live vaccines, deferiprone.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Nelarabine is contraindicated during pregnancy.  It can cause fetal harm. Effective contraception should be used during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose for men and 6 months after the last dose for women.  Breastfeeding is contraindicated while taking nelarabine.
