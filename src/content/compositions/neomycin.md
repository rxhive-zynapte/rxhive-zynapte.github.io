## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Neomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic primarily used for bowel preparation before surgery to reduce the risk of infection. It's also used topically for skin infections and ophthalmic infections. Orally, it can be used to treat hepatic encephalopathy.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Neomycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by irreversibly binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:** Framycetin, Mycifradin.
- **Brand Names:** Neo-Fradin, Neo-Tab, Nivemycin.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Neomycin exerts its bactericidal effect by irreversibly binding to specific proteins within the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit. This binding interferes with the accurate reading of messenger RNA (mRNA) by the ribosome, leading to miscoded proteins and the inhibition of protein synthesis.  This ultimately causes bacterial cell death. Neomycin is particularly effective against gram-negative bacteria.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Oral absorption is minimal (around 3%).  Topical application results in limited systemic absorption. Higher absorption can occur in individuals with bowel inflammation or damage.
    - **Distribution:**  If absorbed systematically, it is distributed widely in tissues and can cross the placental barrier.  It has poor penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid.
    - **Metabolism:** Neomycin is not extensively metabolized.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily excreted unchanged via the kidneys. Dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment.

- **Mode of Action:** Binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria, interrupting protein synthesis.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Bowel Preparation:** 1 gram every hour for 4 hours, then 1 gram every 4 hours for 20 hours. Or, 1 gram at 1 PM, 2 PM, and 11 PM the day before an 8 AM surgery. Often combined with erythromycin base or metronidazole.
- **Hepatic Encephalopathy:** 4-12 grams daily in divided doses for 5-6 days for hepatic coma. Up to 4 grams daily for chronic hepatic insufficiency.
- **Other:** 1-3 grams every six hours for 5-6 days.

#### **Children:**
- **Bowel Preparation:** 90 mg/kg/day in 6 divided doses for 2-3 days.
- **Hepatic Encephalopathy:** 50-100 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses for 5-6 days (maximum 12 grams/day).
- **Other:** 14.7 mg/kg every 4 hours for 3 days.
- **Pediatric Safety:** Neonates and premature infants are at increased risk of ototoxicity (hearing loss).  Use with caution.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Increased risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Close monitoring of renal function and hearing is recommended. Dose reduction may be needed.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage reduction is required. Close monitoring of renal function and drug levels.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustment is generally not needed except in the context of hepatic encephalopathy.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution advised in patients with neuromuscular disorders (myasthenia gravis, Parkinson's disease) as neomycin can exacerbate muscle weakness.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing in specific clinical settings is covered above (Bowel Preparation, Hepatic Encephalopathy). Neomycin is not typically used in situations like intubation, surgical procedures (except for bowel preparation), mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Renal impairment: Reduce dosage and monitor drug levels.
- Hepatic impairment: Generally no adjustment needed except in the context of hepatic encephalopathy.

- Neuromuscular blocking agents (increased risk of respiratory paralysis)
- Oral anticoagulants (enhanced effect)
- Digoxin, penicillin V, vitamin B12, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil (decreased absorption)


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Category D (evidence of human fetal risk, but potential benefits may outweigh risks in certain situations). Use only if clearly needed and the benefit outweighs the risk.
- **Fetal Risks:** Ototoxicity (hearing loss), nephrotoxicity.
- **Breastfeeding:** Neomycin may pass into breast milk. Monitor breastfed infants for gastrointestinal effects (diarrhea, candidiasis). Consider discontinuing breastfeeding or the drug.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

## **Precautions**

- Assess renal function and hearing before and during treatment.
- Monitor for signs of hypersensitivity and neuromuscular blockade.
- Use with caution in elderly patients and those with renal impairment.
- Avoid concurrent use of other nephrotoxic or ototoxic drugs.
- Patients with bowel obstruction or inflammatory bowel disease should not take oral neomycin.
