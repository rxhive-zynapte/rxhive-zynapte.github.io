      **A:** Administer 0.03-0.07 mg/kg IV slowly over at least 1 minute, with a
      maximum dose of 5 mg in adults or 2.5 mg in children. Atropine should be
      given prior to or concurrently to reduce muscarinic side effects.

      What is a cholinergic crisis, and how is it treated?**


      **A:** A cholinergic crisis is a condition characterized by excessive
      muscle weakness and respiratory paralysis due to overstimulation of
      cholinergic receptors. It can be caused by an overdose of neostigmine.
      Treatment involves respiratory support and administration of atropine.

      **A:** Neostigmine improves muscle strength in myasthenia gravis patients
      by increasing acetylcholine levels at the neuromuscular junction. Dosing
      is individualized based on patient needs and response, and it can be
      administered orally, IM, or SC.

## **Usage**

Neostigmine is prescribed for:

*   **Myasthenia Gravis:**  A chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease characterized by weakness and fatigability of skeletal muscles.
*   **Reversal of Nondepolarizing Neuromuscular Blockade:** Used after surgery to reverse the muscle relaxation induced by drugs like rocuronium, vecuronium, etc.
*   **Postoperative Urinary Retention and Paralytic Ileus:** Helps restore bladder and bowel function after surgery.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Cholinesterase inhibitor, parasympathomimetic.

**Mechanism of Action:** Neostigmine increases the concentration of acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction by reversibly inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the enzyme that breaks down ACh. This increased ACh concentration stimulates nicotinic receptors on skeletal muscle, improving muscle contraction.

## **Alternate Names**

While "neostigmine" is the generic name, it is often used in conjunction with the salt form, such as neostigmine methylsulfate or neostigmine bromide.

**Brand Names:** Prostigmin, Bloxiverz.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Neostigmine primarily acts at the neuromuscular junction by inhibiting AChE. It also has effects on muscarinic receptors, leading to parasympathetic stimulation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:**  Administered intravenously (IV), intramuscularly (IM), or subcutaneously (SC). Oral absorption is variable and incomplete.
*   **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver by microsomal enzymes and by AChE in the plasma.
*   **Elimination:** Excreted primarily through the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** Neostigmine binds reversibly to AChE, preventing the breakdown of ACh.  This results in accumulation of ACh at the synaptic cleft, prolonging its action on nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction, leading to increased muscle strength and improved neuromuscular transmission.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Neostigmine acts as a reversible competitive inhibitor of AChE.  At higher doses, it can also weakly stimulate nicotinic receptors directly.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion. Some hepatic metabolism also occurs.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   **Myasthenia Gravis:** 15-375 mg orally per day, divided into multiple doses. IM/SC: 1-2.5 mg as needed, with a total daily dose of 5-20 mg. IV: Reserved for myasthenic crisis. 
*   **Reversal of Neuromuscular Blockade:** 0.03-0.07 mg/kg IV, administered slowly over 1 minute. Maximum dose: 5 mg.

#### **Children:**

*   **Myasthenia Gravis (Oral):** &lt;6 years: Start with 7.5 mg/day, titrating based on response (max 90 mg/day); 6-12 years: Start with 15 mg/day, titrating based on response (max 90 mg/day). IM/SC: 0.2-0.5 mg for children &gt;1 month to 11 years.  Adolescents (12-17 years): Same as adult dose.
*   **Reversal of Neuromuscular Blockade:** 0.03-0.07 mg/kg IV, administered slowly over 1 minute. Maximum dose: 2.5 mg.


#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Monitor closely; they may experience prolonged drug effects.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be needed.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment may be needed.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with bronchial asthma, cardiovascular disease, epilepsy, peptic ulcer, or hyperthyroidism.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

*   **Intubation:** Used to reverse neuromuscular blockade after intubation.
*   **Surgical Procedures:**  Reversal of neuromuscular blockade post-surgery.
*   **Mechanical Ventilation:** May be used to improve muscle strength in patients weaning from mechanical ventilation.
*   **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Similar to mechanical ventilation usage.
*   **Emergency Situations:** Not typically used in emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are necessary based on patient-specific factors such as renal or hepatic dysfunction, age, and concurrent medications.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, increased salivation, sweating, miosis (constricted pupils), increased urination.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, respiratory depression, seizures, allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), cholinergic crisis (excessive muscle weakness and respiratory paralysis).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

With long-term use for myasthenia gravis, dose adjustments may be needed due to disease progression or tolerance.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any signs of cholinergic crisis or severe allergic reactions require immediate intervention.



## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to neostigmine.
*   Peritonitis.
*   Mechanical obstruction of the intestinal or urinary tract.

## **Drug Interactions**

*   **Depolarizing muscle relaxants (e.g., succinylcholine):** Prolongs the action.
*   **Certain antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides):** May enhance neuromuscular blockade.
*   **Anticholinergics (e.g., atropine):** Antagonizes muscarinic effects.
*   **Beta-blockers:** Can worsen bradycardia.
*   **Other drugs affecting neuromuscular transmission:** Use with caution.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
