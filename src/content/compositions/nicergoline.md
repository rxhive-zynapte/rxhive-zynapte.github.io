## Usage

Nicergoline is prescribed for the symptomatic treatment of cognitive disorders, including memory loss, lack of concentration, and mood changes, often associated with cerebrovascular insufficiency and dementia. It is also used for other vascular disorders like Raynaud's syndrome and peripheral vascular disease.  Pharmacologically, nicergoline is classified as a vasodilator and a nootropic. It improves cognitive function by increasing cerebral blood flow and metabolism.

## Alternate Names

Nicergoline is known internationally by the same name. Brand names under which it's marketed include Sermion, Nicerium, and Fitergol.


## How It Works

**Pharmacodynamics:** Nicergoline acts as a vasodilator, primarily affecting alpha-adrenergic receptors, leading to improved blood flow, particularly in the cerebral and peripheral circulation.  It also has some anti-platelet and neuroprotective effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Nicergoline is readily absorbed following oral administration, but undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver, reducing its bioavailability to less than 5%. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within 1-1.5 hours. It is highly protein-bound (over 90%). Nicergoline is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. The metabolites are primarily excreted renally. The elimination half-life is estimated to be around 13-20 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Nicergoline binds to alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, blocking their vasoconstricting effects.  It also appears to enhance cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission, contributing to improved cognitive function. Additionally, it inhibits platelet aggregation and reduces blood viscosity, supporting better microcirculation.

**Elimination Pathways:** The metabolites of nicergoline are primarily excreted via the kidneys. Hepatic metabolism, involving CYP2D6, also plays a significant role in its elimination.

## Dosage


### Standard Dosage

#### Adults:

The standard oral dosage for adults is 30-60 mg daily, divided into 1-3 doses taken at regular intervals.

#### Children:

Nicergoline is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years old due to a lack of established safety and efficacy data.

#### Special Cases:

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required, but caution is advised due to potential age-related decline in organ function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage reduction is recommended for patients with impaired renal function as metabolites are primarily eliminated renally.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised and dosage adjustment may be necessary due to its extensive liver metabolism.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is advised for patients with comorbid conditions like gout, hypertension, or recent myocardial infarction.

### Clinical Use Cases

Nicergoline does not have specific dosage recommendations for procedures like intubation, surgical interventions, mechanical ventilation, or ICU/emergency use. Its primary use is in chronic conditions relating to vascular or cognitive impairment.


### Dosage Adjustments

Dosage adjustments should be individualized based on patient-specific factors such as renal function, hepatic status, and the presence of other medical conditions. Consider genetic polymorphisms affecting CYP2D6 as they may impact drug metabolism.



## Side Effects

### Common Side Effects

Common side effects include nausea, gastrointestinal discomfort (dyspepsia, diarrhea, constipation), dizziness, headache, hot flashes, drowsiness, and sleep disturbances.

### Rare but Serious Side Effects

Rare but serious side effects include allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), severe hypotension, bradycardia, and increased bleeding risk (especially when co-administered with anticoagulants).

### Long-Term Effects

Potential long-term effects are not well established, but chronic use may theoretically increase the risk of cardiovascular issues due to its vasodilatory properties.

### Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)

Clinically significant ADRs requiring immediate intervention include severe allergic reactions, pronounced hypotension, and signs of increased bleeding.



## Contraindications

Absolute contraindications include hypersensitivity to nicergoline, acute bleeding, recent myocardial infarction, severe bradycardia, and uncontrolled hypertension. Relative contraindications include hepatic or renal impairment, history of gout or hyperuricemia, and concurrent use of alpha or beta-blockers.

## Drug Interactions

Nicergoline may interact with other medications, including antihypertensives, anticoagulants, and medications metabolized by CYP2D6. Concurrent use of alpha- or beta-blockers can potentiate hypotensive effects. Anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents may increase the risk of bleeding. CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine) can increase nicergoline levels, while inducers (e.g., rifampicin) can decrease them. Alcohol may enhance dizziness.

## Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

Nicergoline is generally not recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to limited safety data.  Animal studies have shown some developmental effects. Its excretion in breast milk is not fully understood. If use is deemed essential, careful risk-benefit assessment is required.

## Drug Profile Summary

* **Mechanism of Action:** Vasodilator, alpha-1 adrenergic blocker, improves cerebral blood flow and metabolism, potential neuroprotective and anti-platelet effects.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, dizziness, gastrointestinal upset, headache, hot flashes, drowsiness; rarely, severe hypotension, allergic reactions, increased bleeding.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, acute bleeding, recent MI, severe bradycardia, uncontrolled hypertension.
* **Drug Interactions:** Antihypertensives, anticoagulants, CYP2D6 substrates/inhibitors/inducers, alcohol.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Not recommended.
* **Dosage:**  Adults: 30-60 mg/day divided into 1-3 doses. Adjustments needed for renal/hepatic impairment. Not for use in children under 18.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, heart rate, cognitive function, signs of bleeding.

## Popular Combinations

Nicergoline is sometimes combined with other nootropics or vasodilators, but the rationale for these combinations is not firmly established. Potential synergistic effects should be weighed against the increased risk of side effects.

## Precautions

General precautions involve screening for allergies, pre-existing cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal conditions. Use with caution in the elderly. Avoid alcohol. It can cause dizziness, so advise patients against driving or operating machinery until the effects are known. For pregnant and breastfeeding women, use only if absolutely necessary.
