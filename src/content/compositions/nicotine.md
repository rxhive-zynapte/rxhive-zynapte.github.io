      **A:** Yes, combining NRT with non-nicotine medications like bupropion or
      varenicline can sometimes increase the chances of quitting successfully.
      However, this should be done under the guidance of a healthcare
      professional.

## **Usage**

- Nicotine is primarily used for smoking cessation, helping individuals withdraw from tobacco products.  It can reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms associated with quitting smoking.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT), Cholinergic Agonist.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain, mimicking the effects of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter. This leads to the release of dopamine and other neurotransmitters, producing feelings of pleasure and reward, thereby reducing cravings for cigarettes.

## **Alternate Names**

-  3-(1-Methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)pyridine
- **Brand names:** Nicoderm, Nicorette, Nicotrol, Habitrol (and many others depending on country and specific formulation).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Nicotine stimulates the central and peripheral nervous systems, leading to increased heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration. It also affects the gastrointestinal system and can cause nausea and vomiting.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Rapidly absorbed through the lungs, oral mucosa, and skin.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP2A6 enzymes.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated via renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** Nicotine is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist. It binds to these receptors, triggering the release of dopamine, norepinephrine, and other neurotransmitters in the mesolimbic pathway, the brain's reward center.  This leads to feelings of pleasure and satisfaction that contribute to the addictive nature of nicotine.
- **Receptor Binding:** Binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), particularly the α4β2 subtype.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Renal excretion (primarily), hepatic metabolism (CYP2A6).


## **Dosage**

Nicotine dosage is highly individualized and dependent upon the method of administration and the degree of nicotine dependence. Please note that dosage information is current as of today's date (16 February 2025) and may be updated in the future.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Patches:** Available in various strengths (7 mg, 14 mg, 21 mg).  Usually applied once daily.  Higher doses initially, tapered over weeks. Duration of therapy typically 8-12 weeks.
- **Gum:** 2 mg or 4 mg pieces.  Chew intermittently for 30 minutes as needed, up to 24 pieces per day.
- **Lozenges:** 2 mg or 4 mg lozenges. Dissolve in mouth over 20-30 minutes, up to 20 lozenges per day.
- **Inhaler:** Each cartridge delivers about 4 mg nicotine. Use one cartridge every 1-2 hours initially, up to 6-16 cartridges per day.
- **Nasal Spray:** 1 spray in each nostril (1 mg total) per hour, not exceeding 5 doses per hour or 40 doses per day.

#### **Children:**

NRT is generally not recommended for children under 18 years of age, except under specialist guidance.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Consider lower doses, particularly for patients with co-existing conditions.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution advised. Monitor closely. Dosage adjustments might be needed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution advised. Lower initial doses may be required as nicotine clearance can be decreased.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized assessment and dose adjustments may be necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Nicotine is not routinely used in these medical settings. Its primary use is for smoking cessation. It is being investigated in research settings for potential therapeutic effects in other conditions.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with renal/hepatic dysfunction, concurrent medications, or other patient-specific factors. Consultation with a specialist is advisable.



## **Side Effects**
