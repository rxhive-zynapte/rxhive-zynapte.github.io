      What is the recommended dosage for Nicotinic acid?**


      **A:** The dosage depends on the indication and individual patient
      factors.  For dyslipidemia in adults, it typically starts at 250 mg orally
      at bedtime and is gradually increased.  For pellagra, 300-500 mg/day in
      divided doses is common.  Pediatric and other dosages should be determined
      by a physician.

      How can flushing be managed?**


      **A:** Taking nicotinic acid with meals or taking aspirin 30 minutes prior
      can help reduce flushing. Slow titration of dose is also helpful.

      pregnancy. Low doses for nutritional supplementation are generally
      considered safe, but a physician should be consulted.

      including alcohol, anticoagulants, antihypertensives, and statins. A full
      medication review should be conducted before starting niacin therapy.

      **A:** Both are forms of vitamin B3, but nicotinic acid is primarily used

      treating niacin deficiency and does not generally have the same lipid
      effects. Nicotinamide also typically causes less flushing.

## **Usage**

- Nicotinic acid, also known as niacin or vitamin B3, is prescribed for treating **dyslipidemia** (high cholesterol and triglycerides), specifically elevated total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and triglycerides (TG). It also increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).  It is also used to reduce the risk of recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with a history of MI and hyperlipidemia. Niacin is indicated as adjunctive therapy for treatment of adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia who present a risk of pancreatitis. Additionally, it is used to treat **pellagra**, a condition caused by niacin deficiency.
- **Pharmacological Classification**: Lipid-lowering agent, Vitamin.

## **Alternate Names**

- Niacin
- Vitamin B3
- Nicotinamide (a related compound, also a form of vitamin B3)
- Brand names: Niacor, Niaspan

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Nicotinic acid reduces the hepatic synthesis of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and LDL, ultimately leading to lower levels of LDL-C and TG. It also increases HDL-C levels. The precise mechanism is not fully elucidated but involves inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2), an enzyme essential for triglyceride synthesis. 
- **Pharmacokinetics**:
    - **Absorption**:  Well-absorbed orally.
    - **Metabolism**: Converted to nicotinamide and other metabolites in the liver.
    - **Elimination**: Primarily renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults**:

- **Dyslipidemia**: Initial dose: 250 mg orally at bedtime. Gradually increase every 4-7 days to 1.5-2 g/day in divided doses. Maximum dose: 6 g/day. Extended-release: Initial dose: 500 mg at bedtime. Increase every 4 weeks to 1-2 g/day.
