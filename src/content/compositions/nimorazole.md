## **Usage**

Nimorazole is prescribed for the treatment of:

* **Trichomoniasis:** A sexually transmitted infection caused by the parasite *Trichomonas vaginalis*.
* **Bacterial vaginosis:** An infection caused by an overgrowth of certain bacteria in the vagina.
* **Amoebiasis:** An infection caused by the parasite *Entamoeba histolytica*, affecting the intestines or other organs.
* **Giardiasis:** An infection of the small intestine caused by the parasite *Giardia lamblia*.
* **Acute ulcerative gingivitis:**  A severe form of gum infection.

It is also used as a radiosensitizer in the treatment of head and neck cancers, enhancing the effects of radiation therapy on hypoxic tumor cells.

**Pharmacological classification:**  Antiprotozoal, antibacterial, radiosensitizer.  Nimorazole belongs to the nitroimidazole class.

**Mechanism of Action (brief):** Nimorazole acts by disrupting DNA synthesis and damaging DNA within microorganisms, leading to cell death.  In hypoxic tumor cells, it is preferentially reduced, forming reactive metabolites that increase DNA damage, making the cells more sensitive to radiation.


## **Alternate Names**

No widely used alternate generic names exist.  A previous investigational name was K-1900.

**Brand Names:**  Various brand names exist depending on the region.  Examples include Naxogin, Nitromidazole.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Nimorazole is selectively absorbed by anaerobic bacteria and protozoa. Inside these organisms, it undergoes reductive activation, generating cytotoxic metabolites. These metabolites damage microbial DNA, inhibiting DNA repair and leading to cell death.  Similarly, under hypoxic conditions in tumor cells, nimorazole undergoes reduction, forming reactive intermediates that damage DNA and increase sensitivity to radiation therapy.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Nimorazole is well-absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in approximately 1-2 hours. Food may slightly delay absorption but doesn't significantly affect bioavailability.
* **Metabolism:** Metabolized primarily in the liver, with minor pathways involving reduction and glucuronidation.
* **Elimination:** Excreted primarily in the urine, with a small amount in feces. Elimination half-life is variable, but generally around 8-12 hours in adults.

**Mode of Action (cellular/molecular level):**  Enters susceptible cells by passive diffusion. Under low oxygen conditions, the nitro group of nimorazole is reduced, generating a radical anion. This anion then interacts with DNA, forming adducts and causing strand breaks. This DNA damage disrupts replication and transcription, leading to cell death.


**Receptor binding/enzyme inhibition:** No specific receptor binding or enzyme inhibition known.


**Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion, some hepatic metabolism.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Trichomoniasis:** 2 g as a single dose OR 500 mg twice daily for 5-7 days. Sexual partners should be treated concurrently.
* **Amoebiasis:** 500-750 mg twice daily for 5-10 days.
* **Giardiasis:** 500 mg twice daily for 5-7 days.
* **Acute ulcerative gingivitis:** 500 mg twice daily for 2 days.
* **Radiosensitizer:** 1.2 g/m² orally approximately 90 minutes prior to each radiation fraction. In case of twice-daily fractions, the second dose is reduced to 1 g. Total cumulative dose should not exceed 40 g/m² or 75g.

#### **Children:**

Dosing should be weight-based and determined by a physician.  Limited data exists for pediatric use outside of specific protocols.  For amoebiasis, typical dosing ranges from 35-50 mg/kg/day divided into three doses for 10 days.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary in cases of renal or hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution and dose reduction may be needed, as it's primarily renally eliminated.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Caution advised. Dose adjustment may be required in moderate to severe impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Case-by-case evaluation is required.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The listed clinical use cases (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations) are not typically indications for nimorazole.  It's primarily used as an anti-infective and a radiosensitizer as described above.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments based on renal/hepatic function and other comorbid conditions should be made in consultation with a physician.

* **Disulfiram:**  May increase risk of neurotoxicity
* **Lithium:** Potential for increased lithium levels.
* **Phenytoin:** Nimorazole may increase phenytoin levels
* **Fluorouracil:**  Nimorazole can enhance fluorouracil toxicity.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Avoid during the first trimester. Use with caution in later trimesters only if clearly needed.
* **Breastfeeding:** Excreted in breast milk.  Weigh risks versus benefits.  Interrupt breastfeeding or consider an alternative medication.
