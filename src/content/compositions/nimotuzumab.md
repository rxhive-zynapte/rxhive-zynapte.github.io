## **Usage**

- Nimotuzumab is prescribed for the treatment of various cancers, including head and neck cancer, glioma (a type of brain cancer), nasopharyngeal cancer, and other tumors of epithelial origin. It may also be used for pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer in certain cases. In Cuba, it's used in pediatric patients with recurrent brain tumors.  It is often used in conjunction with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Monoclonal antibody; Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) antagonist.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Nimotuzumab binds to EGFR, a protein found on the surface of many types of cells, including cancer cells. This binding inhibits the EGF pathway, which is involved in cell growth and proliferation. By blocking this pathway, Nimotuzumab can help to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells. Its lower affinity for EGFR compared to other similar antibodies makes it more selective to cells with high EGFR expression, potentially reducing side effects on healthy tissues.


## **Alternate Names**

- h-R3
- BIOMAb EGFR
- TheraCIM
- Theraloc
- CIMAher


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Nimotuzumab's primary effect is to inhibit tumor cell growth and proliferation by binding to EGFR and blocking the EGF pathway. This leads to decreased cell signaling and reduced tumor growth.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Administered intravenously, therefore 100% bioavailable in the systemic circulation.
    - **Distribution:** Mainly distributed in the liver, spleen, heart, kidney, and bladder, with a high uptake by the liver.
    - **Metabolism:**  As a monoclonal antibody, metabolism is primarily through proteolytic degradation throughout the body, rather than specific organ-mediated metabolism.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily through proteolytic degradation, with some elimination through the urinary tract (21-34% depending on dosage). Clearance decreases with increasing dose, plateauing at doses above 200 mg. The terminal half-life ranges from 62 hours at a 50 mg dose to 304 hours at a 400 mg dose.
- **Mode of Action:** Nimotuzumab binds to the extracellular domain of EGFR, thereby blocking the binding of EGF and other ligands. This inhibition prevents receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation, which are essential steps in the activation of downstream signaling pathways involved in cell growth and proliferation. 
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Binds to EGFR, thereby inhibiting the receptor's tyrosine kinase activity. It does not involve enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly through proteolytic degradation, similar to other monoclonal antibodies, along with some urinary excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 200 mg weekly as a continuous intravenous infusion over 60 minutes, in combination with radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Maintenance dose may be 200 mg every two weeks. For head and neck cancers, 200 mg weekly for 6 weeks has been used concurrently with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.

#### **Children:**

- 150 mg/m² body surface area (BSA) weekly for 6 weeks (induction phase).  Patients without disease progression at 8 weeks proceed to the consolidation phase, receiving 150 mg/m² BSA every 3 weeks until disease progression, administered as a continuous intravenous infusion over 30 minutes.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Clinical studies have included patients up to 78 years old, but no specific dosage adjustments are explicitly recommended. Use with caution due to potential age-related decline in organ function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No specific dosage adjustments are provided. Monitor renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are provided. Monitor hepatic function.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with chronic diseases in decompensated phases, such as cardiac dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, or arterial hypertension. 

### **Clinical Use Cases**
