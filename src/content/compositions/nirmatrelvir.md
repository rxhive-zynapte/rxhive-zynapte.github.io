## **Usage**

- Nirmatrelvir, co-administered with ritonavir, is prescribed for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and children (12 years and older weighing at least 40 kg) who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.  This includes individuals with certain underlying medical conditions like diabetes, chronic lung disease, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.  Treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after diagnosis and within 5 days of symptom onset.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Antiviral (specifically, a SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor).
- **Mechanism of action:** Nirmatrelvir inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro, also known as 3CLpro), an enzyme crucial for viral replication.  By blocking Mpro, nirmatrelvir prevents the virus from processing polyproteins necessary for the assembly of new viral particles, thereby halting viral replication.  Ritonavir, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, is co-administered to slow down nirmatrelvir's metabolism, boosting its concentration in the body and prolonging its antiviral effect.


## **Alternate Names**

- Nirmatrelvir is primarily known by the brand name **Paxlovid** when co-packaged with ritonavir.



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Nirmatrelvir exerts its antiviral effect by specifically targeting and inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, an enzyme essential for viral replication. This inhibition disrupts viral polyprotein processing, preventing the formation of functional viral particles and ultimately stopping viral replication.  Ritonavir boosts nirmatrelvir's plasma concentration by inhibiting CYP3A, the enzyme responsible for its metabolism.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Nirmatrelvir is administered orally and achieves peak plasma concentrations approximately 3 hours post-dose when taken with ritonavir.  Food does not significantly affect its absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Nirmatrelvir is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4.  Ritonavir co-administration significantly inhibits this metabolism, substantially increasing nirmatrelvir's plasma levels and prolonging its half-life.
    - **Elimination:**  Nirmatrelvir is eliminated primarily through hepatic metabolism, with a small portion excreted unchanged in the urine and feces. Ritonavir also undergoes hepatic metabolism.
- **Mode of action:**  Nirmatrelvir acts as a competitive, reversible inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.  It binds to the active site of Mpro, blocking the protease's ability to cleave viral polyproteins into functional proteins required for viral replication.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Nirmatrelvir's mechanism involves enzyme inhibition specifically targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.  It does not directly bind to receptors or modulate neurotransmitters.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4, followed by excretion of metabolites in urine and feces.  A small portion of nirmatrelvir is excreted unchanged.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 300 mg nirmatrelvir (two 150 mg tablets) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet) taken orally twice daily (every 12 hours) for 5 days.  All three tablets should be taken together.  Treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after diagnosis and within 5 days of symptom onset.

#### **Children:**

- For children 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kg, the dosage is the same as for adults (300 mg nirmatrelvir with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily for 5 days).
- Paxlovid is not recommended for children younger than 12 years of age or weighing less than 40 kg.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is generally needed.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    - Moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30-59 mL/min): 150 mg nirmatrelvir with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily for 5 days.
    - Severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min):  Not recommended.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
    - Mild to moderate impairment: No dose adjustment needed.
    - Severe impairment:  Not recommended.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Careful consideration of drug interactions is crucial, particularly for patients on medications metabolized by CYP3A4.  Dose adjustments or alternative medications might be necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- The use of Paxlovid is specifically for outpatient treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in patients at high risk of progression to severe disease.  Its use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations has not been established, and it's not indicated for these scenarios.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments are primarily based on renal function, as described above.  For patients with drug interactions, modifications depend on the specific interacting drug and may involve dose reduction, temporary discontinuation, or switching to an alternative medication.




## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Dysgeusia (altered taste)
- Diarrhea
- Headache
- Vomiting

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (e.g., rash, hives, swelling, difficulty breathing)
- Liver problems (e.g., jaundice, dark urine)
- Severe drug interactions (potentially life-threatening)


### **Long-Term Effects**

- Long-term effects of Paxlovid are still under investigation, as it is a relatively new drug.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Clinically significant ADRs mainly involve severe allergic reactions and serious drug interactions, which require immediate discontinuation of the drug and appropriate medical management.



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to nirmatrelvir, ritonavir, or any components of the formulation.
- Severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min).
- Severe hepatic impairment.
- Concomitant use with medications highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance or strong CYP3A inducers.



## **Drug Interactions**

- Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir has numerous drug interactions due to ritonavir's potent CYP3A4 inhibition. Clinically significant interactions can occur with:
    -  Some antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, dronedarone, flecainide, propafenone, quinidine – some contraindicated)
    -  Some anticonvulsants (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital)
    -  Some antidepressants (e.g., St. John's wort)
    -  Some antipsychotics (e.g., pimozide)
    -  Some anticoagulants (e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban)
    -  Some immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus)
    -  Some statins (e.g., simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin)
    -  Some sedatives/hypnotics (e.g., triazolam, midazolam)
    -  Some hormonal contraceptives
- Refer to the Paxlovid prescribing information for a complete list of drug interactions.  Interactions can involve CYP450 enzymes (primarily CYP3A4), P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and other drug transporters.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Paxlovid is not recommended during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. There are limited data on its use in pregnancy.  Animal studies have shown some developmental toxicity.
