## **Usage**

Nitrofurantoin is a synthetic antibacterial agent primarily used for the treatment and prophylaxis of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is effective against a range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including *Escherichia coli*, *Staphylococcus saprophyticus*, *Enterococcus faecalis*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, and *Enterobacter* species.  Nitrofurantoin is classified as a nitrofuran antibiotic. Its mechanism of action involves inhibiting bacterial enzymes essential for carbohydrate metabolism, DNA synthesis, and cell wall formation.

## **Alternate Names**

While "nitrofurantoin" is the generic name, brand names vary depending on the formulation and country. Some examples include Macrobid, Macrodantin, and Furadantin.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Nitrofurantoin exerts its antibacterial effects primarily within the urinary tract due to its high concentration in urine. It disrupts several bacterial enzymatic processes, including those involved in carbohydrate metabolism, DNA synthesis, RNA synthesis, cell wall synthesis, and protein synthesis, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Nitrofurantoin is administered orally and is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Absorption is enhanced when taken with food.  It is rapidly metabolized in the body, primarily in the liver, and excreted mainly in the urine, giving it its high urinary concentration.  The macrocrystalline formulations (Macrodantin) are absorbed more slowly, leading to a longer duration of action. The monohydrate/macrocrystal formulation (Macrobid) has a dual release mechanism, resulting in both rapid and sustained release.

**Mode of Action:** Nitrofurantoin acts through multiple mechanisms. It inhibits bacterial enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, disrupts DNA and RNA synthesis, and interferes with cell wall formation. These actions work synergistically to kill bacteria or inhibit their growth.

**Elimination:**  Nitrofurantoin is primarily eliminated via renal excretion.  A small amount is excreted in the bile and feces. Dosage adjustments are required for patients with renal impairment.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Uncomplicated UTIs:**
    * Macrocrystals (Macrodantin): 50-100 mg four times daily for 7 days.
    * Monohydrate/macrocrystals (Macrobid): 100 mg twice daily for 5-7 days.
* **Prophylaxis:** 50-100 mg at bedtime.
* **Severe/Chronic UTIs:** 100mg four times daily for 7 days
* **Long-term suppression therapy:** 50-100 mg once daily

#### **Children (over 3 months):**

* 5-7 mg/kg/day divided into four doses for 7 days.
* Suppressive therapy: 1mg/kg/day once daily

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution. Start with a lower dose (e.g., 50 mg twice daily) and monitor for adverse effects. Dosage adjustments may be needed based on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance <45 mL/min. Use with caution if creatinine clearance is between 30-44 mL/min for short courses (3-7 days) if benefits outweigh risks.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Monitor liver function tests.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary depending on the specific comorbidity.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Nitrofurantoin's clinical use is primarily limited to uncomplicated UTIs. It is not recommended for use in the following settings due to poor tissue penetration or risk of inadequate therapeutic levels:

* **Intubation**
* **Surgical Procedures** (prophylactic usage for certain urological procedures may be an exception)
* **Mechanical Ventilation**
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
* **Emergency Situations**

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on creatinine clearance. For patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, a reduced dose and close monitoring are required.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* **Other antibiotics:** Potential antagonistic effects.
* **Food:** Taking nitrofurantoin with food improves absorption and tolerance.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Generally safe during the first and second trimesters. Contraindicated at term (38-42 weeks) due to risk of neonatal hemolytic anemia.
* **Breastfeeding:** Small amounts are excreted in breast milk.  Can be used during breastfeeding but use with caution especially during the first month and with hyperbilirubinemic infants due to the risk of hemolytic anemia. Monitor the infant for jaundice and hemolytic anemia.
