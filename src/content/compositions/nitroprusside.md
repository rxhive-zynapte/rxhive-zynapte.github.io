## **Usage**

- Nitroprusside is prescribed for the immediate reduction of blood pressure in hypertensive crises and for controlled hypotension during surgery to reduce bleeding.  It is also used in acute decompensated heart failure.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Vasodilator (direct-acting, both arterial and venous).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Nitroprusside acts directly on vascular smooth muscle, causing vasodilation and reducing peripheral vascular resistance. This leads to a decrease in blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

- Sodium Nitroprusside
- **Brand Names:** Nitropress, Nipride RTU

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Nitroprusside causes rapid and balanced vasodilation of both arteries and veins, leading to decreased preload and afterload.  This reduces cardiac work and blood pressure.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Administered intravenously.
    - Rapid onset of action (1-2 minutes).
    - Short half-life (approximately 2 minutes).
    - Metabolized in the blood to release nitric oxide (NO) and cyanide ions. Cyanide is subsequently converted to thiocyanate in the liver by the enzyme rhodanese and excreted renally.
- **Mode of Action:** Nitroprusside non-enzymatically releases NO in the bloodstream. NO activates guanylate cyclase within smooth muscle cells, leading to increased cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). This, in turn, activates protein kinase G, which ultimately causes vascular smooth muscle relaxation.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of thiocyanate.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial infusion rate: 0.3 mcg/kg/min.
- Titrate every 5 minutes to achieve the desired blood pressure.
- Usual dose range: 0.5-4 mcg/kg/min.
- Maximum dose: 10 mcg/kg/min (not to be sustained for more than 10 minutes).

#### **Children:**

- Initial infusion rate: 0.3 mcg/kg/min.
- Titrate every 5 minutes to effect.
- Maximum dose: 10 mcg/kg/min (not to be sustained for more than 10 minutes).
- Pediatric safety considerations: Close monitoring for cyanide toxicity is crucial in children, especially with prolonged or high-dose infusions.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate with lower doses due to increased sensitivity to hypotensive effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use lowest effective dose and monitor thiocyanate levels. For eGFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73 mÂ², limit infusion rate to less than 3 mcg/kg/minute. In anuria, limit to 1 mcg/kg/minute.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with extreme caution and monitor for cyanide toxicity due to reduced thiocyanate conversion.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is essential for patients with conditions like myocardial infarction, increased intracranial pressure, and hypothyroidism.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation:** Dosage titrated to achieve desired blood pressure control.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Dosage titrated to maintain controlled hypotension.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Dosage adjusted based on blood pressure response.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Continuous blood pressure monitoring and dosage titration are crucial.
- **Emergency Situations (e.g., hypertensive crisis):**  Initial dose of 0.3 mcg/kg/min titrated rapidly to effect, not to exceed 10 mcg/kg/min.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjust dose based on patient response and renal/hepatic function.
- Monitor thiocyanate levels with prolonged use, especially in renal impairment.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Thiocyanate toxicity (with prolonged use)

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Thiocyanate toxicity (hypothyroidism, tinnitus, disorientation)

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe hypotension requiring fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support.
- Cyanide toxicity requiring immediate treatment with sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate.


## **Contraindications**

- Inhaled anesthetics: Enhanced hypotensive effects.
- Heparin: Reduced anticoagulant effect of heparin.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Pregnancy Safety Category: C
- Fetal risks: Cyanide toxicity, fetal death.
- Breastfeeding: Not recommended due to potential cyanide and thiocyanate exposure to the infant.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **General Precautions:** Continuous blood pressure monitoring is mandatory.  Close monitoring for cyanide toxicity, especially with high doses or prolonged infusions. Renal and hepatic function should be assessed prior to administration.
- **Specific Populations:** As described above.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Caution patients about potential dizziness and orthostatic hypotension.
