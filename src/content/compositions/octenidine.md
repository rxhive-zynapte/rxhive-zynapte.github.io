## **Usage**

Octenidine dihydrochloride is a topical antiseptic used for the treatment and prevention of skin and mucous membrane infections. It is effective against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, including bacteria (gram-positive and gram-negative), fungi (dermatophytes and *Candida*), and lipophilic viruses.  It's pharmacological classification is antiseptic. Its mechanism of action involves disrupting the cell membranes of microorganisms, leading to their destruction.

## **Alternate Names**

Octenidine dihydrochloride is sometimes referred to simply as octenidine. Brand names include Octenisept, Octenident, Neocide, and MestaMidin-sens.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Octenidine exhibits rapid antimicrobial activity, generally within 30 seconds to a few minutes, by targeting and disrupting the cell membranes of a wide range of microorganisms. It has no known effect on human cell membranes.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Octenidine dihydrochloride exhibits minimal systemic absorption after topical or mucosal application. Any absorbed drug is predominantly excreted via the kidneys. The component phenoxyethanol in some formulations is rapidly absorbed and eliminated almost completely as an oxidation product by the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** Octenidine's mode of action involves hydrophobic interactions with the cell membranes of microorganisms. The two cationic centers in the octenidine molecule contribute to this interaction, leading to membrane disruption and microbial death. There is no known development of resistance to octenidine.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Octenidine does not bind to specific receptors, inhibit enzymes, or modulate neurotransmitters in humans. Its action is localized to the site of application, targeting microbial cell membranes.

**Elimination Pathways:** Octenidine dihydrochloride is primarily excreted renally after topical or mucosal application. The component phenoxyethanol in some formulations is also eliminated via renal excretion as an oxidation product.

## **Dosage**

Octenidine solutions, gels, and sprays are available for various applications. Dosage and application frequency vary depending on the indication and formulation. Always consult the product's specific instructions.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Topical application of Octenidine solutions or gels, allowing a few minutes for drying. Frequency varies by indication (e.g., 1-5 times daily). For oral use, rinse with approximately 20ml of the product for 20-30 seconds, then spit, 3-4 times a day.

#### **Children:**  Consult a pediatrician before use. Some formulations containing phenoxyethanol are contraindicated for use in children due to toxicity concerns. Other formulations are generally safe for use in children, including infants, with proper precautions.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically needed.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically needed due to minimal systemic absorption.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically needed due to minimal systemic absorption.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Considerations for specific conditions should be based on the site of application and the nature of the comorbid condition. 


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific medical settings are based on local guidelines and product-specific instructions:

- **Intubation:**  Use a diluted solution for mucosal antisepsis before intubation.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Apply as a skin antiseptic before surgical procedures.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:**  Use for oral hygiene in mechanically ventilated patients to reduce bacterial load and prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  Daily body wash with octenidine may reduce nosocomial infections.
- **Emergency Situations:** Apply to wounds and burns as needed.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- **Renal/Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific adjustments are generally necessary.
- **Metabolic Disorders:**  No specific adjustments are generally necessary.
- **Genetic Polymorphisms:** No specific adjustments are currently known.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Skin irritation, redness, itching, burning sensation, and dryness at the application site.
- Temporary taste disturbance (bitter aftertaste), mild, reversible dental discoloration, and numb sensation in the mouth with oral rinse.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions (severe itching, rash, swelling, dizziness, difficulty breathing).
- Tissue necrosis (with deep tissue administration).


### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Skin dryness and cracking with prolonged use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Severe allergic reactions require immediate medical attention.



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to octenidine dihydrochloride or any components of the formulation.
- Application to the eyes, ears, abdominal cavity, middle ear or external auditory meatus (ear canal) or eardrum (unless specifically formulated for these areas).
- Some formulations are contraindicated for use in neonates and young children due to the presence of phenoxyethanol.
- Avoid use with products containing PVP iodine or anionic surfactants as these can interfere with the efficacy of octenidine.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Avoid concomitant use with other topical antiseptics, particularly iodine-based and alcohol-based products, as they can decrease octenidine's efficacy.
- Anionic substances might impair the antiseptic effect of octenidine.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Limited data suggest no adverse effects on fetal development. However, pregnant and breastfeeding women should consult their healthcare provider before using octenidine. Avoid applying to the breasts or nipples immediately before breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Disrupts microbial cell membranes.
- **Side Effects:**  Skin irritation, allergic reactions (rare).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, application to eyes or middle ear.
- **Drug Interactions:** Iodine-based and alcohol-based antiseptics, anionic surfactants.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult healthcare provider before use.
