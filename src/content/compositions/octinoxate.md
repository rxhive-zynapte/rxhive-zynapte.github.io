## **Usage**

- Octinoxate is primarily prescribed for protecting the skin from the harmful effects of ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation, which is a primary cause of sunburn. It is used in a variety of sunscreen products.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Sunscreen agent, UVB filter.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Octinoxate absorbs UVB radiation, preventing it from penetrating the skin and causing damage.  It converts the absorbed radiation into heat, which is then dissipated from the skin.

## **Alternate Names**

- Octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC)
- Ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate
- Parsol MCX
- Parsol MOX
- Escalol
- Brand names:  Numerous sunscreen products contain octinoxate. Specific brand names are numerous and constantly changing but the ingredient list is a reliable way to identify products containing octinoxate.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Octinoxate primarily affects the skin by absorbing UVB radiation. The absorption of UVB rays prevents them from reaching the deeper layers of the skin and causing damage such as sunburn, premature aging, and potentially skin cancer.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Octinoxate is applied topically and can be absorbed through the skin, although the extent of absorption is limited.  Studies have detected octinoxate in urine, blood, and breast milk, indicating systemic exposure. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily through urine.
- **Mode of Action:** Octinoxate functions by absorbing UVB radiation through its chemical structure. The molecule undergoes a conformational change upon absorbing UV light, converting the radiation into heat energy, which is then released from the skin.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**  While octinoxate's primary action is UVB absorption, research suggests potential endocrine-disrupting effects, meaning it might interact with hormone receptors. However, further research is needed to fully understand these effects.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily metabolized by the liver with subsequent renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

Octinoxate is for topical application only, as directed on the product label or by a physician.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Apply liberally 15-30 minutes before sun exposure.
- Reapply at least every two hours, or immediately after swimming or excessive sweating.

#### **Children:**

- Use as directed on the product label.
- For children under six months, consult a physician.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically necessary, but elderly individuals may have thinner skin, increasing the potential for absorption.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No specific dose adjustments are required for patients with renal impairment. However, caution should be exercised if there is significant skin damage.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**   No specific dose adjustments, but consider potential drug interactions and monitor for any adverse effects.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consult a physician for any coexisting conditions impacting skin sensitivity.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Octinoxate is not typically used in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, or in the ICU. It is used as a preventative measure against sun damage.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

No dosage adjustments are typically required for other conditions other than those related to skin sensitivity, damage, or allergy.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Mild skin irritation
- Redness
- Itching

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
- Severe skin irritation

### **Long-Term Effects**

The long-term effects of regular octinoxate application require further investigation. Concerns exist regarding potential endocrine disruption and impact on hormone levels with chronic use. 

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Allergic reactions.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to octinoxate or any other ingredients in the sunscreen product.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Limited information is available regarding specific drug interactions with octinoxate. However, always inform your physician about all medications and topical products you are using, especially if also using topical acne medications or products containing peroxides.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Data on human pregnancy risks are limited.  Octinoxate has been detected in breast milk. Caution is advised.
- **Fetal risks:**  Limited data.
- **Drug excretion in breast milk:**  Present.
- **Alternative safer options:**  Mineral sunscreens containing zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are generally considered safer during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Absorbs UVB radiation, converting it to heat.
- **Side Effects:** Skin irritation, redness, itching, allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:** Limited data. Inform physician of all medications being used.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Limited human safety data. Use caution and consider mineral sunscreens.
- **Dosage:** Topical application as directed on product label.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Observe for skin irritation or allergic reactions.


## **Popular Combinations**

Octinoxate is often combined with other UV filters, such as avobenzone, oxybenzone, and zinc oxide, to provide broad-spectrum protection against both UVA and UVB radiation.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Perform a patch test before applying to large areas, especially on sensitive skin.
- **Specific Populations:**  Avoid using on broken or irritated skin. Consult physician if pregnant or breastfeeding.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** No specific lifestyle considerations except for regular sunscreen application.
