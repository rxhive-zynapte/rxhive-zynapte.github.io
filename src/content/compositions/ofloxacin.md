## **Usage**

Ofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic belonging to the fluoroquinolone class. It is prescribed for various bacterial infections, including:

* Lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., bronchitis, pneumonia)
* Urinary tract infections (e.g., cystitis, pyelonephritis, prostatitis)
* Sexually transmitted infections (e.g., gonorrhea, chlamydia, cervicitis, urethritis)
* Skin and skin structure infections
* Infectious diarrhea
* Acute pelvic inflammatory disease

**Pharmacological Classification:** Fluoroquinolone antibiotic.

**Mechanism of Action:** Ofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication and repair. This inhibition leads to bacterial cell death.



## **Alternate Names**

Ofloxacin is also known as Floxin and Floxin I.V (brand names).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ofloxacin exerts its bactericidal effect by inhibiting bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. This disrupts DNA replication and repair, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Ofloxacin is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1-2 hours. Food may slightly delay absorption but does not significantly affect overall bioavailability.
* **Metabolism:** Ofloxacin undergoes minimal hepatic metabolism.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated renally (via urine) as unchanged drug. Some elimination occurs through feces.


**Mode of Action:** Ofloxacin targets bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. These enzymes are crucial for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, and repair. By inhibiting their activity, ofloxacin prevents the supercoiling and relaxation of DNA necessary for cell function, resulting in the death of bacterial cells.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Ofloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.

**Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly renal excretion; minor fecal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Most Infections:** 200-400 mg every 12 hours for 7-14 days (depending on the infection).  Up to a maximum of 800mg daily.
* **Gonorrhea:** 400 mg as a single dose.

#### **Children:**

Ofloxacin is generally contraindicated in children and adolescents under 18 years due to the risk of cartilage damage. In some cases, it may be used in children if the benefits outweigh the risks and no safer alternatives are available.  Dosage must be determined by a doctor.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments based on renal function are often necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment based on creatinine clearance is necessary.
    * CrCl 20-50 mL/min: Administer standard dose every 24 hours.
    * CrCl < 20 mL/min: Administer one-half the standard dose every 24 hours.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** A maximum dose of 400 mg/day is recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring and potential dose adjustments may be needed based on the specific comorbidity.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, and ICU use must be determined by the treating physician based on individual patient needs.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be required for renal/hepatic impairment.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea
* Diarrhea
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Insomnia
* Vaginal itching or discharge

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Tendinitis and tendon rupture
* Peripheral neuropathy
* Seizures
* QT prolongation
* *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea
* Hypersensitivity reactions (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome)


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Peripheral neuropathy and tendon damage may persist even after discontinuation of ofloxacin.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Serious ADRs like tendon rupture, severe hypersensitivity reactions, and QT prolongation require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to ofloxacin or other fluoroquinolones.
* Myasthenia gravis.
* Epilepsy or conditions predisposing to seizures.
* History of QT prolongation.
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding.
* Children and adolescents under 18 years of age (generally contraindicated).

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Antacids, Sucralfate, Multivitamins/Minerals:** These can decrease ofloxacin absorption. Separate administration by at least 2 hours.
* **Theophylline:** Ofloxacin can increase theophylline levels, leading to toxicity. Monitor theophylline levels closely.
* **Warfarin:** Ofloxacin can enhance the effects of warfarin, increasing the risk of bleeding. Monitor INR closely.
* **NSAIDs:** Concurrent use with NSAIDs can increase the risk of seizures.
* **Antiarrhythmic Drugs:** Ofloxacin can prolong the QT interval and increase the risk of arrhythmias when used with other drugs that also prolong the QT interval (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, quinidine).
* **CYP450 Interactions:** Ofloxacin is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2 and can potentially interact with drugs metabolized by this enzyme.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Ofloxacin is contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential risks to the fetus/infant (cartilage damage, arthropathy).



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, insomnia, tendinitis, peripheral neuropathy.
