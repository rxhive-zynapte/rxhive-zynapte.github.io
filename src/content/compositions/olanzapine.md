## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Olanzapine is prescribed for the treatment of schizophrenia, moderate to severe manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, and maintenance therapy for bipolar I disorder to prevent the recurrence of manic or mixed episodes. It is also used in combination with fluoxetine for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.  Olanzapine is sometimes used off-label for agitation, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and other conditions.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Atypical antipsychotic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Olanzapine acts as an antagonist at multiple receptors, primarily dopamine and serotonin receptors (including dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4, and serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6 receptors), and also at muscarinic, histamine H1, and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. Its therapeutic effects are primarily thought to be mediated through dopamine and serotonin receptor antagonism.


## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:** The generic name "olanzapine" is widely used internationally.
- **Brand Names:** Zyprexa, Zyprexa Zydis (orodispersible tablets), Zyprexa Relprevv (extended-release injection), and Lybalvi (combination with samidorphan).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Olanzapine primarily affects the central nervous system by blocking dopamine and serotonin receptors.  This action helps regulate mood, thoughts, and behavior in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The drug also has some anticholinergic, antihistaminic, and alpha-1 adrenergic blocking effects.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Olanzapine is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations in approximately 5 to 8 hours. Food does not significantly affect its absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Olanzapine is extensively metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP1A2 and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6.  Smoking can induce CYP1A2 and lead to increased olanzapine metabolism.
    - **Elimination:** Olanzapine and its metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine (57%) and feces (30%). The elimination half-life of olanzapine is variable, averaging around 30 hours, but can range from 21 to 54 hours, and may be prolonged in the elderly and those with hepatic or renal impairment.
- **Mode of Action:** Olanzapine's primary mode of action involves blocking dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain.  By binding to these receptors, it reduces the effects of these neurotransmitters.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Olanzapine binds to several dopamine and serotonin receptor subtypes, including D1, D2, D3, D4, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, and 5-HT6. It also has some affinity for muscarinic, histamine H1, and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism (CYP1A2 and CYP2D6) followed by excretion of metabolites in urine and feces.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Schizophrenia:** Initial dose is 5-10 mg orally once daily, usually titrated to a target dose of 10 mg/day.  Dose adjustments can be made in 5 mg increments at intervals of not less than 1 week. The maximum dose is generally 20 mg/day, although higher doses (up to 40 mg/day) may be used in treatment-resistant cases with careful monitoring.
- **Bipolar Mania (Monotherapy):** Initial dose is 10 or 15 mg orally once daily. Dose adjustments can be made in 5 mg increments/decrements at intervals of not less than 24 hours. Maintenance dose is 5-20 mg orally once daily. Maximum dose: 20 mg/day.
- **Bipolar Mania (Adjunctive Therapy with Lithium or Valproate):** Initial dose is 10 mg orally once daily.  Adjustments can be made as clinically indicated, not to exceed 20 mg/day.
- **Bipolar Depression (with Fluoxetine):** Initial dose is 5 mg olanzapine with 20 mg fluoxetine once daily in the evening.  Your doctor may adjust the dose as needed, but the maximum is typically 18 mg olanzapine with 75 mg fluoxetine daily.


#### **Children:**

- Olanzapine is not approved for use in children younger than 13 years for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder.
- **Schizophrenia (13-17 years):** Initial: 2.5 to 5 mg once daily.  Target: 10 mg once daily; further dose adjustments in 2.5-5 mg increments at intervals not less than 1 week. Maximum: 20 mg/day.
- **Bipolar I Disorder (13-17 years):** Initial: 2.5 to 5 mg once daily.  Target: 10 mg once daily; further dose adjustments in 2.5-5 mg increments as needed. Maximum: 20 mg/day.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  A lower starting dose (5 mg/day) is recommended for patients 65 years or older.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No routine dose adjustment is necessary, but a lower initial dose may be considered.  Not recommended for patients with end-stage renal disease.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No routine dose adjustment is necessary, but a lower initial dose may be considered in moderate hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, prostatic hypertrophy, narrow-angle glaucoma, history of paralytic ileus, or seizures.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Olanzapine is not specifically indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.  Other medications are generally preferred for these purposes. However, olanzapine may be used for agitation or delirium in these settings on a case-by-case basis under careful supervision.  For agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania, short-acting intramuscular olanzapine can be used (2.5-10 mg/dose). Additional doses up to a maximum of 30 mg/day may be given, but with caution due to the risk of orthostatic hypotension.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be required based on individual patient response, tolerability, age, concurrent medications, and the presence of renal or hepatic impairment.  Slow titration and careful monitoring are crucial, especially in special populations.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Somnolence, dizziness, weight gain, increased appetite, dry mouth, constipation, orthostatic hypotension, akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, hyperprolactinemia, asthenia, peripheral edema, elevated liver enzymes, and hyperglycemia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), tardive dyskinesia, seizures, severe neutropenia, DRESS syndrome, hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma, venous thromboembolism, and suicidal thoughts or behavior.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Weight gain, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, tardive dyskinesia.
