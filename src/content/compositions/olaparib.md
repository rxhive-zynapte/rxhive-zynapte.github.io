## **Usage**

Olaparib is a targeted therapy drug prescribed for specific types of cancers, including:

* **Ovarian Cancer:**  Maintenance treatment of recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer responsive to platinum-based chemotherapy. Treatment of advanced ovarian cancer with germline *BRCA* mutations.
* **Breast Cancer:**  Treatment of germline *BRCA*-mutated, HER2-negative metastatic or early breast cancer, particularly in those who have received prior chemotherapy or are unsuitable for endocrine therapy.
* **Pancreatic Cancer:** Treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer with germline *BRCA* mutations in combination with other chemotherapy
* **Prostate Cancer:** Treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene mutations including *BRCA1/2*, often in combination with Abiraterone.


**Pharmacological Classification:**  PARP (Poly ADP-ribose polymerase) inhibitor.

**Mechanism of Action:** Olaparib inhibits PARP enzymes involved in DNA repair. Cancer cells with *BRCA* mutations or other defects in homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathways rely on PARP for DNA repair. By inhibiting PARP, Olaparib prevents DNA repair, leading to cell death in these cancer cells, while sparing normal cells with intact HRR pathways. This is known as synthetic lethality.

## **Alternate Names**

**Generic Name:** Olaparib

**Brand Names:** Lynparza

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Olaparib selectively targets PARP enzymes, crucial for single-strand DNA break repair. Its primary anti-cancer effect stems from exploiting the concept of "synthetic lethality" in cancer cells deficient in homologous recombination repair. Inhibition of PARP in these cells leads to accumulation of single-strand breaks that convert into double-strand breaks, resulting in genomic instability and ultimately apoptosis (programmed cell death).

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Olaparib is well-absorbed orally. Food can increase exposure in capsule form.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, making it susceptible to drug interactions with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors.
* **Elimination:** Excreted via both renal and hepatic pathways.


**Mode of Action:** Olaparib binds to and inhibits PARP enzymes, specifically PARP1 and PARP2, which are involved in the base excision repair pathway. This pathway is essential for repairing single-strand DNA breaks. By inhibiting PARP, olaparib traps it on the DNA, preventing the repair process. The trapped PARP-DNA complexes stall replication forks and cause double-strand DNA breaks, leading to cell death, especially in cancer cells with deficient homologous recombination DNA repair mechanisms.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Olaparib acts through direct enzyme inhibition of PARP. It doesn't bind to receptors or directly modulate neurotransmitters.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Olaparib is eliminated through a combination of hepatic metabolism (mainly via CYP3A4) and renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Tablets:** 300 mg (two 150 mg tablets) twice daily (total 600 mg daily), with or without food.
* **Capsules**: 400mg BD PO. The dose should be taken two hours before food or one hour after food.
* **In Combination with Abiraterone**: 300mg BD PO.
Treatment should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

#### **Children:**

Safety and efficacy haven't been fully established in pediatric patients. A phase 1 study suggested a dose of 187.5 mg/m<sup>2</sup> twice daily, but more research is needed.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No initial dose adjustment is required, but close monitoring is advised. Limited data exists for patients 75 years and older.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    * **Mild (CrCl 51-80 mL/min):** No dose adjustment needed.
    * **Moderate (CrCl 31-50 mL/min):** Reduce dose to 200 mg twice daily.
    * **Severe (CrCl ≤30 mL/min):** Not recommended.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
    * **Mild to Moderate (Child-Pugh A or B):** No dose adjustment needed, but careful monitoring is required.
    * **Severe (Child-Pugh C):** Not recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is necessary for patients with pre-existing medical conditions, especially pulmonary or hematologic issues.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Olaparib dosing is based on cancer type and patient-specific factors, not specific clinical settings like intubation or surgery. The dosages mentioned above under "Standard Dosage" apply to the relevant cancer indications.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be necessary based on individual patient factors:
