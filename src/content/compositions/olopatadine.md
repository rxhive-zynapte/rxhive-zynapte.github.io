## **Usage**

Olopatadine is prescribed for the treatment of ocular signs and symptoms of seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis (eye allergies).  It is also effective for the treatment of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) when administered intranasally.

Olopatadine is pharmacologically classified as an antihistamine and mast cell stabilizer. 

It works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during an allergic reaction that causes itching, redness, and watering of the eyes.  It also inhibits the release of other mediators from mast cells, further reducing the allergic response.

## **Alternate Names**

Olopatadine Hydrochloride

**Brand Names:** Pataday, Patanol, Pazeo, Opatanol, APO-Olopatadine


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Olopatadine exerts its anti-allergic effects by selectively antagonizing histamine H1 receptors. This action prevents histamine from binding to its receptors, thus inhibiting the downstream effects that lead to allergic symptoms.  It also stabilizes mast cells, preventing the release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Olopatadine is readily absorbed following topical ocular administration. It achieves peak concentrations in the plasma within a few hours.  Systemic absorption is low.  It is metabolized primarily in the liver but some excretion may occur through renal pathway, as 60-70% of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine.

**Mode of Action:** Olopatadine binds competitively to histamine H1 receptors, preventing the binding of histamine.  This inhibits the activation of H1-receptor-mediated pathways, resulting in the suppression of allergic symptoms.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
* **Olopatadine 0.1% solution:** One drop in each affected eye twice daily, approximately 6-8 hours apart.
* **Olopatadine 0.2% or 0.7% solution:** One drop in each affected eye once daily.

* **Olopatadine 0.1% solution:**  For children 3 years and older, the dosage is the same as for adults (one drop in each affected eye twice daily).
* **Olopatadine 0.2% solution:** For children 2 years and older, the dosage is the same as for adults (one drop in each affected eye once daily).

*Use in children under 2 or 3 years (depending on the specific formulation) has not been established.*


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is typically necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is expected to be needed.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment is expected to be needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with dry eye or other ocular surface disorders.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  
Olopatadine's clinical use is primarily focused on allergic conjunctivitis.  It is not typically indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**  
While no specific dosage adjustments are usually necessary for elderly patients or those with renal or hepatic impairment, dose modification may be considered in patients with severe dry eye or other ocular surface disorders.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
* Eye pain, burning, stinging, or dryness
* Headache
