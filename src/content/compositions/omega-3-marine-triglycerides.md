## **Usage**

Omega-3 marine triglycerides are primarily prescribed as an adjunct to diet and exercise for adults with very high hypertriglyceridemia (≥500 mg/dL).  They are also used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with established cardiovascular disease and persistently elevated triglyceride levels (≥150 mg/dL) despite statin therapy.  Their pharmacological classification is as a lipid-lowering agent. The mechanism of action involves reducing the production of triglycerides in the liver and increasing their breakdown in the bloodstream.

## **Alternate Names**

- Fish Oil
- Omega-3 Fish Oil
- N-3 Fatty Acids
- Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs)

**Brand names:**

- Lovaza
- Vascepa (icosapent ethyl - purified EPA)
- Epanova


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Omega-3 marine triglycerides primarily reduce triglyceride levels through multiple mechanisms:
    - Decreased hepatic very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis and secretion.
    - Increased lipoprotein lipase activity, which enhances triglyceride breakdown.
    - Reduced hepatic lipogenesis.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, especially when taken with meals.
    - **Metabolism:** undergoes hepatic metabolism, similar to other fatty acids.
    - **Elimination:** eliminated through several routes, including biliary excretion, beta-oxidation and incorporation into cell membranes. No specific CYP enzyme interactions are known.

**Mode of Action:**
Omega-3 fatty acids, specifically EPA and DHA, influence gene expression related to lipid metabolism, inflammation, and cell function.  This occurs partly through binding to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs).

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

For hypertriglyceridemia (≥500 mg/dL): 4 g/day, usually taken as two 2-gram capsules twice daily with meals, or as four 1 gram capsules once or twice daily.

For cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia despite statin therapy: 4 g/day icosapent ethyl (purified EPA), usually as two 2-gram capsules twice daily. Note, this purified EPA formulation is preferred by the AHA to avoid the potential of increased LDL-C levels.


#### **Children:**

Not FDA-approved for patients younger than 18.  Limited data suggest potential benefits in specific conditions like pediatric non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), however, dosage recommendations are not yet established. Dosing has ranged from 450 to 1300 mg daily depending on age and weight in clinical trials.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: No specific dosage adjustments are indicated.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Dosage adjustments have not been defined.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Dosage adjustments have not been defined.  Close monitoring of liver function tests is advised.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Careful consideration is necessary for patients with diabetes, as omega-3 fatty acids may increase LDL cholesterol, and cardiovascular disease.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosages for conditions other than hypertriglyceridemia are not well established and often based on research trials or expert opinions.  These uses are considered off-label:

- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, Emergency Situations**: Parenteral fish oil lipid emulsions are being investigated, but standard dosing guidelines haven't been established. Doses used have varied greatly, ranging from 0.05 gm/kg/day to 6.5 g/day or even higher.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Data on dosage adjustments based on renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms are limited.  Clinical judgment is essential.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, eructation, vomiting, abdominal distension, diarrhea, constipation)
- Acne or eczema
- Mild, transient elevation in liver enzymes



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
- Excessive bleeding (especially in patients taking anticoagulants)


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Limited information is available on potential long-term effects.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Clinically significant ADRs are rare but require immediate intervention.  These include severe allergic reactions and uncontrolled bleeding.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to fish or fish oil.
- Active bleeding or bleeding disorders.


## **Drug Interactions**

- **Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin):** May increase bleeding risk. Close monitoring of INR is necessary.
- **Antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel):** May also increase bleeding risk.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  C (animal studies show adverse effects, but no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women; benefits may outweigh potential risks). 
- **Fetal risks:** Limited data suggest no significant fetal harm, but avoiding high doses is recommended.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Omega-3 fatty acids are present in breast milk, and limited data suggest that usual doses of omega-3 supplementation are safe for breastfeeding mothers and infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends an intake for breastfeeding mothers of at least 2 servings of low-mercury fish weekly, equivalent to approximately 200-300 mg/day of DHA.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Reduces hepatic VLDL production and increases triglyceride breakdown via lipoprotein lipase activation.
- **Side Effects:** GI issues, skin reactions, mild liver enzyme elevations.  Rarely, bleeding or allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to fish oil, active bleeding.
- **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution during pregnancy.  Generally considered safe during breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** Hypertriglyceridemia: 4 g/day.  Cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia despite statin therapy:  4g/day icosapent ethyl (purified EPA).
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Triglyceride levels, LDL cholesterol, liver function tests, signs of bleeding (if taking anticoagulants).

## **Popular Combinations**

- Statins: Often prescribed concurrently with omega-3 fatty acids, especially for patients with mixed dyslipidemia. However, the purified EPA formulation is favored by the AHA for patients on statins.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Evaluate for underlying causes of hypertriglyceridemia. Assess for bleeding risk. Monitor liver function tests.
- **Specific Populations:**
    - **Pregnant Women:** Use with caution. Discuss potential risks and benefits with the patient.
    - **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Limited data suggest safety, but high doses should be avoided.
    - **Children & Elderly:** No specific precautions.
