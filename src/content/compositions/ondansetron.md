## **Usage**

- Ondansetron is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with:
    - Highly and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy
    - Radiotherapy
    - Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV)
- **Pharmacological classification:** Antiemetic, 5-HT3 receptor antagonist.
- **Mechanism of action:**  Ondansetron selectively blocks serotonin 5-HT3 receptors, both peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), thus inhibiting the vomiting reflex.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Ondansetron
- **Brand names:** Zofran, Zofran ODT, Zuplenz.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ondansetron exerts its antiemetic effect by antagonizing serotonin 5-HT3 receptors in the gastrointestinal tract and the CTZ.  This action blocks serotonin-induced nausea and vomiting.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Well-absorbed orally. Bioavailability is slightly reduced by food.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily hepatic, via CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2 enzymes.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily renal (approximately 44-60% excreted unchanged in urine), with a small portion excreted in feces. The elimination half-life is approximately 3-6 hours in adults, longer in neonates and young children.
- **Mode of Action:** Competitive antagonism of 5-HT3 receptors on vagal afferent neurons in the gut and the CTZ.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**  Selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. It does not interact significantly with other receptor types, including dopamine, histamine, or muscarinic receptors.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of unchanged drug and metabolites. Hepatic metabolism by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2 contributes to clearance.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Chemotherapy/Radiotherapy-induced Nausea/Vomiting:**
    - Moderately emetogenic chemotherapy: 8 mg orally 30 minutes before chemotherapy, followed by 8 mg every 12 hours for 1-2 days.
    - Highly emetogenic chemotherapy:  A single dose of up to 24 mg orally (with 12 mg dexamethasone) 1 to 2 hours before chemotherapy, or 0.15 mg/kg IV (max 16 mg/dose) 30 minutes before chemotherapy, then repeated 4 and 8 hours after the first dose.  Continue oral dosing at 8 mg every 12 hours for 1-2 days following the intravenous dose.
- **Postoperative Nausea/Vomiting:**
    - Prophylaxis: 16 mg orally 1 hour before anesthesia, or 4 mg IV immediately before or after surgery. Patients weighing >80 kg may require an additional 4 mg IV.
    - Treatment: 4 mg IV for established PONV.
- **Radiotherapy-induced Nausea/Vomiting:** 8 mg orally 1-2 hours before treatment, followed by 8 mg every 8 hours (for total body irradiation and single high-dose fraction to the abdomen). Continue for 1 to 2 days after completion of abdominal therapy, but give the medication before radiotherapy with daily fractions to the abdomen.

#### **Children (6 months and older):**

- **Chemotherapy-induced Nausea/Vomiting:** 0.15 mg/kg IV (maximum 16 mg/dose), 30 minutes before chemotherapy, followed by doses at 4 and 8 hours after the first dose. Alternatively, the dose can be calculated based on body surface area. Oral dosing can begin 12 hours later at 4 mg twice daily for up to 5 days.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  May require dose reduction, particularly for intravenous administration or in patients over 75 years old. Initial IV doses should be administered as a slow infusion. The maximum initial IV dose should not exceed 8 mg.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Maximum daily dose 8 mg in moderate to severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution in patients with cardiac conditions, electrolyte abnormalities, or those taking other QT-prolonging drugs.


### **Clinical Use Cases:**

- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  IV administration is generally preferred for immediate control of nausea and vomiting. Standard dosing applies.
- **Emergency Situations:** IV administration for rapid control of nausea and vomiting.


### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- **Renal/Hepatic Dysfunction:**  As noted above.
- **Metabolic disorders or genetic polymorphisms:** No specific adjustments are routinely necessary. However, consider patient-specific factors and monitor for adverse effects.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Headache
- Constipation
- Diarrhea
- Fatigue/Drowsiness


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis, bronchospasm)
- QT prolongation, Torsade de Pointes
- Serotonin syndrome


### **Long-Term Effects:**

No significant long-term effects reported with short-term use.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Anaphylaxis, bronchospasm
- QT prolongation, Torsade de Pointes
- Serotonin syndrome

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to ondansetron.
- Concomitant use with apomorphine.



## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP450 Interactions:** Ondansetron is metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP1A2.  Inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes may alter ondansetron levels.
- **Other clinically significant drug interactions:**
    - Apomorphine (contraindicated)
    - QT prolonging drugs (additive effects)
    - Serotonergic drugs (risk of serotonin syndrome)
- **Commonly prescribed medications:**  Interactions may occur with certain antidepressants, antipsychotics, and antibiotics.
- **OTC drugs and supplements:** No well-documented significant interactions.
- **Food and lifestyle factors:**  Food may slightly decrease bioavailability. No significant interaction with alcohol or smoking.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Previously Category B, now no official US FDA category exists. While large studies have not shown increased risk of major birth defects, some studies have shown a small increased risk of certain orofacial clefts. Consult with a specialist for detailed risk assessment.
- **Fetal risks:**  Possible but unconfirmed increased risk of orofacial clefts. 
- **Breastfeeding:**  Ondansetron is present in breast milk in small amounts.  Generally considered safe to use during breastfeeding, with monitoring for infant side effects like gastrointestinal discomfort. Neonatal effects are considered minimal.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, blocking serotonin-induced nausea and vomiting.
- **Side Effects:** Headache, constipation, diarrhea, fatigue; rarely QT prolongation, serotonin syndrome, hypersensitivity.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to ondansetron, concomitant apomorphine.
