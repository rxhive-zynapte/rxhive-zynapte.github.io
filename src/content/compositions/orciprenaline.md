## **Usage**

Orciprenaline is prescribed for the relief of bronchospasm associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma. It is also used in the treatment of reversible bronchospasm associated with bronchitis and emphysema.  It is classified as a bronchodilator, specifically a β₂-adrenergic agonist. Its mechanism of action involves stimulating β₂-adrenergic receptors in the lungs, leading to relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and bronchodilation.

## **Alternate Names**

The alternate name for Orciprenaline is Metaproterenol. Brand names include Alupent and Orciprenaline Sulphate Syrup.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Orciprenaline acts as a β₂-adrenergic receptor agonist. Upon binding to these receptors, it activates adenylate cyclase, which increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This increase in cAMP leads to relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle, resulting in bronchodilation.  Orciprenaline also inhibits the release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity reactions from mast cells.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:** Orciprenaline is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.
* **Metabolism:** It undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver, which reduces its bioavailability to approximately 40%.
* **Elimination:** Orciprenaline is primarily excreted in the urine as glucuronic acid conjugates. It has a biphasic elimination pattern, with an initial rapid distribution phase and a slower terminal elimination half-life of approximately 15 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Orciprenaline binds to β₂-adrenergic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle cells, initiating a cascade that increases cAMP levels and ultimately relaxes the muscle.

**Receptor Binding:**  Orciprenaline selectively binds to β₂-adrenergic receptors.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion as glucuronic acid conjugates following hepatic metabolism.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

20 mg three or four times daily.  The maximum recommended daily dose is 120 mg.

#### **Children:**

* **4-12 years:** 10 mg three times daily.
* **>12 years:** 20 mg three times daily.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and titrate upwards carefully monitoring for adverse effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary. Monitor renal function closely.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction may be required due to potential decreased metabolism. Close monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, or those sensitive to sympathomimetic amines. Monitor carefully.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Orciprenaline is primarily used for the long-term management of chronic conditions like asthma, bronchitis and emphysema rather than acute settings. Hence specific dosages for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not generally established.  It is crucial to note that Orciprenaline's role in acute asthma management is limited.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments should be based on patient response and tolerance. Monitor for side effects, especially in patients with comorbid conditions. Renal and hepatic function should be considered when adjusting dosage.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Tremor, palpitations, tachycardia, nervousness, headache, dizziness, nausea, and diarrhea.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm), paradoxical bronchospasm, hypokalemia, cardiac arrhythmias, and worsening of pre-existing cardiovascular conditions.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Tolerance to the bronchodilator effect may develop with prolonged use. Chronic use without concomitant anti-inflammatory therapy may worsen asthma control.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, significant changes in blood pressure, and severe cardiac arrhythmias.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to orciprenaline or any component of the formulation; hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy; cardiac arrhythmias associated with tachycardia; concomitant use with beta-blockers (except in overdose management).


## **Drug Interactions**

Other sympathomimetic agents, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), beta-blockers, and xanthine derivatives. May potentiate hypokalemia induced by diuretics and steroids.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category C. Use with caution during pregnancy, weighing potential benefits against fetal risks.  Use cautiously during breastfeeding due to the potential for drug excretion in breast milk and neonatal side effects.

## **Popular Combinations**

Orciprenaline is sometimes combined with inhaled corticosteroids for long-term asthma management.

## **Precautions**

Close monitoring is necessary in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, glaucoma, hypokalemia, or seizures. Avoid long-term daily use for acute asthma. Monitor potassium levels in patients receiving concomitant xanthine derivatives, steroids, or diuretics.
