## **Usage**

Ornithine is primarily used in the management of hepatic encephalopathy, a condition characterized by impaired brain function due to liver disease.  It helps reduce elevated ammonia levels in the blood, a key factor contributing to hepatic encephalopathy.  While studied for potential benefits in athletic performance, wound healing, and other areas, robust scientific evidence for these uses is lacking. It is classified as a hepatoprotective agent and an ammonia-lowering agent. It works by participating in the urea cycle, facilitating ammonia detoxification in the liver. It also plays a role in the Krebs cycle contributing to energy production.


## **Alternate Names**

This amino acid is often referred to as L-ornithine.  There aren't widely recognized international variations for L-ornithine itself; however, combinations like L-ornithine-L-aspartate (LOLA) and ornithine alpha-ketoglutarate (OKG) exist. While they contain ornithine, they are distinct compounds.  Brand names vary by region; one example is Hepa-Merz.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Ornithine's primary effect is reducing elevated blood ammonia levels. It achieves this through two main mechanisms. First, it acts as a substrate in the urea cycle, the metabolic pathway responsible for converting ammonia to urea, which is then excreted by the kidneys. Second, it can be transformed into glutamate, another amino acid, consuming ammonia in the process. The reduction in ammonia levels helps alleviate the symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Ornithine is administered intravenously or orally. Oral administration is generally well-tolerated. Data on its specific absorption, distribution, and metabolism when given as ornithine hydrochloride is limited. After conversion to glutamate, it is involved in other metabolic processes. Elimination details are not comprehensively documented; it likely involves metabolism. LOLA is administered intravenously and rapidly dissociates into ornithine and aspartate after administration.

**Mode of Action:** Ornithine's mode of action revolves around ammonia detoxification primarily through the urea cycle, a sequence of biochemical reactions within the liver.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Oral L-Ornithine L-Aspartate:  1-2 sachets or 1-2 tablets three times daily.  Intravenous L-Ornithine L-Aspartate: Up to 20g daily (up to 4 ampoules), 5g/hr maximum infusion rate.  In hepatic encephalopathy (pre-coma or coma), up to 8 ampoules can be administered within 24 hours.  Ornithine hydrochloride: intravenous dose 20-40 g in combination with aspartate.

#### **Children:**

Pediatric dosing recommendations are not well-established for all forms of ornithine.  For acute pediatric hyperammonemia,  L-Ornithine-L-aspartate may be considered at an initial dose of 200 mg/kg via nasogastric tube, followed by 200 mg/kg every 3-6 hours.  Consultation with a metabolic specialist is crucial. Safety and efficacy in children are not fully established.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments based on age are universally recommended, but close monitoring is advisable due to potential age-related changes in organ function.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** In severe renal impairment or renal failure, L-Ornithine L-Aspartate is contraindicated.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustments are not routinely provided for hepatic dysfunction itself, as the primary indication for ornithine is hepatic encephalopathy.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with severe renal impairment.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in these settings requires individualized assessment and specialist consultation:

* **Intubation:** Data specific to intubation is not explicitly available.
* **Surgical Procedures:**  Dosage adjustments are not explicitly specified for surgical procedures.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** Data specific to mechanical ventilation is not explicitly available.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Dosing should be determined based on individual patient needs and condition.  
* **Emergency Situations:** Consult a metabolic specialist in emergencies related to hyperammonemia. 


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Closely monitor patients with renal impairment.  No specific dose adjustments are explicitly outlined for other conditions.  Therapeutic drug monitoring of ammonia levels is critical.
