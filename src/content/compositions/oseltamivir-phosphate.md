## **Usage**

- Oseltamivir phosphate is prescribed for the treatment and prevention of influenza A and B infections.  It is particularly effective when initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset for treatment and within 48 hours of exposure for prophylaxis. It can be used for prophylaxis in community outbreaks for up to six weeks.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antiviral, neuraminidase inhibitor.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Oseltamivir phosphate is a prodrug that is metabolized to oseltamivir carboxylate.  Oseltamivir carboxylate inhibits the neuraminidase enzyme, which is essential for the release of newly formed influenza virus particles from infected cells. This action reduces viral replication and spread within the respiratory tract, alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of illness.

## **Alternate Names**

- International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Oseltamivir
- **Brand Names:** Tamiflu

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Oseltamivir primarily affects the respiratory tract by inhibiting viral replication and release.  It does not directly kill the virus, but hinders its ability to infect new cells.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Oseltamivir phosphate is orally administered and well-absorbed.  It's rapidly converted by hepatic esterases to the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate.  Oseltamivir carboxylate has a bioavailability of approximately 80% when administered as oseltamivir phosphate. It is primarily eliminated renally as the active metabolite with a half-life of about 1-3 hours.  No dose adjustment is needed for mild to moderate hepatic impairment, but it's not recommended for severe liver disease.
- **Mode of Action:** Oseltamivir carboxylate selectively inhibits influenza neuraminidase, a viral surface glycoprotein.  Neuraminidase is crucial for cleaving sialic acid residues on host cells, enabling the release of newly formed viral particles and facilitating viral spread. By inhibiting this enzyme, oseltamivir prevents viral egress and reduces the infection of new cells.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion as the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Treatment:** 75 mg orally twice daily for 5 days. Initiate within 48 hours of symptom onset.
- **Prophylaxis:** 75 mg orally once daily for at least 10 days. Initiate within 48 hours of exposure. In community outbreaks, administer for up to 6 weeks.

#### **Children:**

- **Treatment (1 year and older):** Dosage is weight-based, see detailed guidelines below. Initiate within 48 hours of symptom onset. Not recommended for treatment of children younger than 2 weeks of age unless prescribed for critical situations by doctor.
- **Prophylaxis (1 year and older):** Dosage is weight-based, see detailed guidelines below. Initiate within 48 hours of exposure. Not approved for prevention in children younger than 1 year.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Generally, no dose adjustments are needed unless renal impairment is present.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose modifications are essential. See below for renal dose adjustments, for both treatment and prophylaxis.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is required for mild to moderate impairment.  Not recommended for severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider individual patient factors like diabetes and cardiovascular disease for adjusting treatment duration.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosages for Clinical Use Cases are the same as treatment recommendations for adults and children and should be initiated within 48 hours. For severe illness, consult infectious disease specialist for personalized therapy:


- **Intubation:**
- **Surgical Procedures:**
- **Mechanical Ventilation:**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** May require longer treatment duration (e.g., 10 days) and should be determined by clinical judgment. Infectious disease specialist should be consulted.
- **Emergency Situations:**

### **Long-Term Effects**

- No specific long-term effects have been identified.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Anaphylaxis

- Hereditary fructose intolerance (for the oral suspension containing sorbitol).

## **Drug Interactions**

- Probenecid: Reduces clearance of oseltamivir carboxylate.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (FDA)
- **Fetal Risks:** Limited data suggest low risk; however, the benefits of treatment may outweigh risks in pregnant women with influenza.  Consider the maternal and fetal risk due to the mother's underlying condition, available safety data, and pathogenicity of the circulating influenza virus strain.
- **Breastfeeding:** Oseltamivir and its metabolite are excreted in breast milk at low concentrations. Consider breastfeeding before taking dose to minimize infant exposure. Monitor infant for potential adverse effects.
