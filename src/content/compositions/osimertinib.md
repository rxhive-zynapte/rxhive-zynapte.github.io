      **A:** Dose reductions to 40 mg once daily may be necessary due to adverse
      events.  Here are dose reduction guidelines for some toxicities:


      * **ILD/pneumonitis:**  Hold osimertinib and investigate. Permanently
      discontinue if confirmed.

      * **Asymptomatic LVEF < 50% and absolute decrease of 10% from baseline:**
      Hold for up to 4 weeks.  If recovers, restart. If no recovery, discontinue
      permanently.

      * **QTc interval > 500 msec on at least 2 separate ECGs:** Hold until QTc
      interval is < 481 msec or recovery to baseline. Then restart at 40mg.

      * **QTc prolonged with signs/symptoms of serious arrhythmia or Symptomatic
      congestive heart failure:** Discontinue permanently.

      * **Signs & symptoms suggestive of keratitis:** Refer promptly to an
      ophthalmologist. For ≥ grade 3 toxicity, hold if suspected and discontinue
      if confirmed. 

      * **Other ≥ grade 3 toxicity:** Hold for up to 3 weeks.  If recovery to ≤
      grade 2, restart at the same dose or at 40mg. If no recovery, discontinue
      permanently.

## **Usage**

Osimertinib is prescribed for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults.  Specifically, it targets NSCLC with:

* Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations. This includes first-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC and adjuvant therapy after complete tumor resection in stages IB-IIIA.
* EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC, especially in cases where the disease has progressed after treatment with other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).

Osimertinib's pharmacological classification is as an **antineoplastic agent**, specifically an **EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor**.

It works by irreversibly binding to certain mutated forms of EGFR, blocking the signals that promote cancer cell growth and survival.

## **Alternate Names**

The International Nonproprietary Name (INN) is osimertinib.  The most widely recognized brand name is **Tagrisso**.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Osimertinib selectively and irreversibly inhibits EGFR tyrosine kinase activity in cells with EGFR-sensitizing mutations (exon 19 deletions and L858R) and the T790M resistance mutation. It shows limited activity against wild-type EGFR.  This targeted inhibition disrupts downstream signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis, leading to tumor regression.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Osimertinib is absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations in approximately 6 hours. Food does not significantly affect absorption.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes in the liver.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion.  Renal elimination plays a minor role. The terminal half-life is approximately 48 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Osimertinib covalently binds to cysteine residues in the ATP-binding pocket of the mutated EGFR tyrosine kinase domain, preventing its activation.

**Receptor binding:** Irreversible binding to mutated EGFR (exon 19 deletions, L858R, T790M).

**Enzyme inhibition:** Inhibits EGFR tyrosine kinase activity.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism (CYP3A4/5) and biliary excretion, with minimal renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 80 mg orally once daily, taken with or without food.

#### **Children:**  Safety and efficacy not established in pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No dose adjustment is generally recommended. However, close monitoring for adverse events is advised.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment necessary for mild to severe renal impairment. Use with caution in end-stage renal disease.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment needed for mild hepatic impairment.  No data available for moderate to severe impairment; use with caution.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised for patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions, especially long QT syndrome or congestive heart failure.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Osimertinib is primarily used for oral administration in outpatient settings for the treatment of NSCLC. Its use in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations is not established.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose reductions to 40 mg once daily may be necessary due to adverse events.  Specific dose adjustments are based on the severity of the toxicity. (See FAQs for details)


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Diarrhea, rash, dry skin, nail changes (paronychia, onycholysis), fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, decreased appetite, stomatitis/mucositis.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Strong CYP3A4 Inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine):**  Avoid if possible. If unavoidable, increase osimertinib dose to 160 mg daily and revert back to 80mg after 3 weeks of inducer discontinuation.

* **Medications that prolong the QTc interval (e.g., amiodarone, quinidine):** Use with caution and monitor ECGs.
* St. John's Wort.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy Safety Category:**  D

**Fetal Risks:** Osimertinib can cause fetal harm based on animal studies.  Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk.  Effective contraception is required during treatment and for 2 months (females) or 4 months (males) after the last dose.

**Breastfeeding:** It is unknown if osimertinib is excreted in human milk. Due to potential risks to infants, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose.
