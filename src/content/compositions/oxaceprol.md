      How does Oxaceprol work?**


      **A:**  It inhibits leukocyte accumulation in the affected joints,
      reducing inflammation and pain. It may also contribute to cartilage repair
      by stimulating the production of certain components within the cartilage
      matrix.

## **Usage**

- Oxaceprol is prescribed for the treatment of osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease. It helps to relieve symptoms such as pain, swelling, and stiffness.  It can also be used for inflammatory connective tissue diseases and superficial burns (topical application).
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).  Also classified as a disease-modifying osteoarthritis drug (DMOAD).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Oxaceprol inhibits the accumulation of leukocytes (white blood cells) in the affected joints, thereby reducing inflammation. While its exact mechanism is not fully understood, it appears to influence connective tissue metabolism and may stimulate the uptake of glucosamine and proline in chondrocytes, contributing to cartilage regeneration. It does *not* inhibit prostaglandin synthesis in vitro.

## **Alternate Names**

-  No widely recognized alternate names are listed in the provided sources. Regional variations may exist.
- **Brand Names:** Iboxa, Oxuba, Lupoxa, Aksiprol, Uceprol, Oxamac, Oxuba OD Tablet SR, Trueceprol, Oxashine, Lupoxa OD, OXAPROCT, StayHappi, Zextra


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Oxaceprol reduces inflammation in joints by inhibiting leukocyte accumulation.  This leads to a decrease in pain, swelling, and stiffness.  It may also promote cartilage repair.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Absorbed within 3.5 hours after oral administration, permeating into synovial fluid. Bioavailability is approximately 30%.
    - **Metabolism:**  Metabolized in the liver. Limited information is available on specific metabolic pathways or CYP enzyme involvement.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted primarily via urine, unchanged and complete. Elimination half-life is approximately 2.2 hours.

- **Mode of Action:** Inhibits leukocyte extravasation and adhesion to capillaries in the affected joints, thus reducing inflammation. In vitro studies suggest it stimulates the uptake of glucosamine and proline by chondrocytes.

- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** The provided sources do not detail specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation.  It does not inhibit prostaglandin synthesis *in vitro*.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Oral: 200 mg three times daily.  In severe cases, the initial dose can be increased to 400 mg three times daily. Tablets/capsules should be taken before meals, unchewed.  Alternatively, 1200 mg once daily can be administered. Maximum dose generally does not exceed 1800mg/day, although doses up to 2400mg/day are mentioned.
- Topical (10% cream): Apply once daily for superficial burns.

#### **Children:**

- Pediatric dosing varies by weight, age, and indication.  Consultation with a doctor is essential for determining the appropriate dose.
- For juvenile rheumatoid arthritis:
     - >55 kg: 1200 mg once daily
     - 32-54 kg: 900 mg once daily
     - 22-31 kg: 600 mg once daily
- For osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis: Dosage to be determined by doctor.
- Below age 6: Safety and efficacy not established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose reduction is recommended due to potential sensitivity to side effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; dosage adjustment may be necessary. In severe renal impairment or patients on dialysis, 600 mg once daily is recommended; this may be increased to 1200 mg/day with close monitoring.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution in patients with severe liver impairment; dosage adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with stomach ulcers, as Oxaceprol may worsen the condition. Also use with caution in patients with liver or kidney impairment.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- The primary clinical use case is the management of osteoarthritis.  Limited information is available regarding specific dosage recommendations for other clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose modifications are necessary based on renal and hepatic function, age, and other patient-specific factors.
