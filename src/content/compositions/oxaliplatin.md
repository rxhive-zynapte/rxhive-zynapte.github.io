      How does Oxaliplatin interact with other drugs?**


      **A:** Oxaliplatin has clinically significant interactions with drugs such
      as aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, and other medications that prolong the
      QT interval. Concurrent use of these drugs might potentiate oxaliplatin's
      toxicity.  Aluminum-containing IV sets are contraindicated as they can
      cause degradation of the oxaliplatin.

## **Usage**

Oxaliplatin is an antineoplastic chemotherapy drug, specifically a platinum-based alkylating agent. It is primarily used in combination with  5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (folinic acid) for:

*   **Adjuvant treatment:** Stage III colon cancer after complete resection of the primary tumor.
*   **Treatment:** Advanced colorectal cancer.
*   Off Label uses include treatment of other cancers like breast, gastric, germ cell, head and neck, non-small cell lung cancer, non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Mesothelioma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer.

It acts by binding to DNA, forming intrastrand and interstrand crosslinks, which inhibit DNA replication and transcription, ultimately leading to cell death.  It primarily targets rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells.


## **Alternate Names**

While "oxaliplatin" is the generic name, it is marketed under brand names such as Eloxatin.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Oxaliplatin exerts its cytotoxic effects by forming platinum-DNA adducts, primarily intrastrand crosslinks, which disrupt DNA replication and transcription. This ultimately triggers apoptosis (programmed cell death) in cancer cells.  Its cytotoxic effect is cell-cycle nonspecific.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Administered intravenously, therefore 100% bioavailable.
*   **Distribution:**  Widely distributed throughout the body,  with a higher concentration found in erythrocytes, kidneys, liver and the gastrointestinal tract.
*   **Metabolism:** Undergoes non-enzymatic conversion to active metabolites, including monoaquo- and diaquo-DACH-platinum. It also undergoes non-enzymatic biotransformation, involving the displacement of the labile oxalate ligand.
*   **Excretion:** Primarily eliminated via renal excretion (approximately 50% within 3 days), with minimal fecal excretion. The terminal half-life of ultrafilterable platinum is around 273 hours (approximately 11 days).  Approximately 90% of platinum in plasma is protein-bound one week after a 2-hour infusion of Oxaliplatin.

**Mode of Action:**

Oxaliplatin's cytotoxicity is mainly due to the formation of covalent platinum-DNA adducts, which interfere with DNA repair mechanisms and ultimately cause cell death. Its mode of action differs from other platinum-based drugs because its bulky 1,2-diaminocyclohexane (DACH) carrier ligand, influencing the type of DNA adducts formed compared to cisplatin or carboplatin, thereby possibly explaining the lack of complete cross-resistance with these two other platinum-based drugs.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Not applicable in the classical sense, as its primary mechanism involves direct DNA interaction.


## **Dosage**

Oxaliplatin is administered intravenously.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   85 mg/m²  infused over 120 minutes, administered concurrently with leucovorin (200 mg/m² over 120 minutes) in separate bags using a Y-line. This is followed by 5-fluorouracil (400 mg/m² IV bolus, then 600 mg/m² as a 22-hour continuous infusion).  This is administered on Day 1 of each 14-day cycle. The same regimen of  leucovorin and 5-fluorouracil is administered on Day 2.
*   **Adjuvant treatment:** Up to 12 cycles (6 months) or until unacceptable toxicity.
*   **Advanced colorectal cancer:**  Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

#### **Children:**

There is no relevant indication for use of oxaliplatin in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established in this population.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustment is required.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    *   Mild to moderate: No dose adjustment.
    *   Severe (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min): Initial dose of 65 mg/m². Avoid use in severe renal impairment.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Mild to moderate: No dose adjustment necessary.  Severe hepatic impairment requires further investigation, and there is no established dose adjustment.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Pre-existing cardiac conditions, electrolyte imbalances, pulmonary impairment, neurological disorders require careful monitoring.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Oxaliplatin is not typically used in clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) use, or emergency situations.  It is primarily used for the cancer indications mentioned above.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

*   **Neurosensory Toxicity:**
    *   Persistent Grade 2: Reduce dose to 75 mg/m² (adjuvant) or 65 mg/m² (advanced colorectal cancer).
    *   Persistent Grade 3: Discontinue oxaliplatin.
*   **Hematologic Toxicity:**
*   After Grade 3/4 gastrointestinal toxicity, Grade 4 neutropenia/febrile neutropenia, or Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia, reduce the dose to 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (adjuvant) or 65 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (metastatic), and 5-fluorouracil to 300mg/m<sup>2</sup> bolus then 500mg/m<sup>2</sup> over 22 hours in combination with leucovorin (200mg/m<sup>2</sup>) over 2 days, as tolerated. Delay subsequent doses until neutrophil count is ≥1.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L and platelet count ≥75 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L.
*   **Renal impairment (severe):** Consider dose reduction or discontinuation.
*   **Acute neurological reactions:** Prolonging the infusion time from 2 hours to 6 hours can be considered, as this can decrease the Cmax by approximately 30% and may lessen the severity of the acute toxicities.
