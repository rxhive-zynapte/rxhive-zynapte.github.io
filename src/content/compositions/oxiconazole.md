## **Usage**

Oxiconazole is prescribed for the topical treatment of fungal skin infections. These include:

*   Tinea pedis (athlete's foot)
*   Tinea cruris (jock itch)
*   Tinea corporis (ringworm)
*   Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antifungal (Imidazole derivative)

**Mechanism of Action:** Oxiconazole inhibits the biosynthesis of ergosterol, a crucial component of fungal cell membranes. This disruption of ergosterol synthesis leads to increased cell membrane permeability and ultimately fungal cell death.


## **Alternate Names**

Oxiconazole nitrate

**Brand Names:** Oxistat



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Oxiconazole exerts fungistatic or fungicidal activity, depending on the concentration and the susceptibility of the fungal species. The primary mechanism is the alteration of fungal cell membranes, resulting in growth inhibition or cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics:** After topical application, minimal absorption occurs, with less than 0.3% of the applied dose recovered in the urine within five days. The highest concentrations are found in the epidermis, with lower concentrations in the upper and deeper layers of the stratum corneum. Oxiconazole is known to inhibit hepatic CYP3A4 enzymes.

**Mode of Action:** Oxiconazole interferes with ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting C-14 methylation of sterol intermediates like lanosterol. Ergosterol is a vital component of the fungal cell membrane, and its depletion compromises membrane integrity, leading to fungal cell death.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily topical; minimal systemic absorption; less than 0.3% excreted in the urine.



## **Dosage**

Oxiconazole is available as a 1% cream and a 1% lotion. 

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults and Children:**

*   **Tinea pedis:** Apply once or twice daily for 4 weeks.
*   **Tinea cruris and Tinea corporis:** Apply once or twice daily for 2 weeks.
*   **Tinea versicolor:** Apply once daily for 2 weeks.


#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is typically necessary.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is required.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment is required.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Oxiconazole's use is restricted to topical application for dermatological fungal infections. It is not indicated for systemic use and therefore not applicable to scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Burning
*   Stinging
*   Itching
*   Redness
*   Irritation at the application site



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Contact dermatitis (allergic skin reaction).



## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to oxiconazole.



## **Drug Interactions**

No clinically significant drug interactions are documented, but concomitant use with nystatin may represent unnecessary duplication of therapy.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy Safety Category:** B (Animal studies have not demonstrated a risk to the fetus, and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. However, the drug should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed.)

**Breastfeeding:** Oxiconazole is distributed into breast milk. Use with caution in nursing mothers.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits ergosterol synthesis, disrupting fungal cell membrane integrity.
*   **Side Effects:** Burning, stinging, itching, redness, irritation. Rarely, contact dermatitis.
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to oxiconazole.
*   **Drug Interactions:** None clinically significant.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Pregnancy Category B; use with caution during breastfeeding.
*   **Dosage:** Topical application once or twice daily for 2-4 weeks, depending on the infection.
*   **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor the affected skin area for signs of improvement or adverse reactions.



## **Popular Combinations**

Oxiconazole is typically used as monotherapy.  No popular combinations are documented.



## **Precautions**

*   For external use only; avoid contact with eyes, mucous membranes, and the vagina.
*   Wash hands after application.
*   Discontinue use and seek medical advice if irritation or sensitivity develops.
