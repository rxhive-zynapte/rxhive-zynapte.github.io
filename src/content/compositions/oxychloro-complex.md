## **Usage**

Oxychloro Complex (SOC) is primarily used as a preservative in ophthalmic solutions (eye drops).  It is not a medication itself and doesn't have a pharmacological classification in the traditional sense (like antibiotic or analgesic). Its role is to prevent microbial contamination in multi-dose eye drop bottles.  It is often combined with various active ingredients intended to treat conditions such as dry eye syndrome, glaucoma, and post-surgical inflammation.

## **Alternate Names**

- Stabilized oxychloro complex (SOC)
- PuriteÂ® (trade name)

## **How It Works**

**Mechanism of Action:**  SOC works by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), like chlorine dioxide. These ROS disrupt microbial cell walls and inhibit essential cellular processes, leading to the death of bacteria and fungi, thus preserving the sterility of the eye drops.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  As a preservative, SOC is present in very low concentrations. Systemic absorption after topical ocular administration is minimal, posing negligible risk of systemic effects.  Information on its specific metabolic pathways or elimination routes is limited due to its low systemic absorption and focus as a preservative.


## **Dosage**

SOC is **not dosed independently**. The dosage of the active medication in the eye drop formulation determines the administration frequency. Always follow the prescribed dosage instructions for the specific eye drop product containing SOC.

### **Standard Dosage**  
Since SOC is a preservative, standard dosing isn't applicable. Refer to the dosage instructions of the active ingredient in the eye drops.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  
SOC's presence as a preservative doesn't alter the clinical use cases of the eye drops it's in. The active ingredients determine the clinical application.

### **Dosage Adjustments**  
No specific dosage adjustments are needed for SOC. Any adjustments would be for the active drug in the formulation.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
Although generally well-tolerated, some individuals may experience mild, transient ocular irritation, burning, stinging, or blurred vision upon instillation.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Hypersensitivity reactions are rare but possible.


## **Contraindications**

Known hypersensitivity to SOC.

## **Drug Interactions**

No significant drug interactions are known specifically for SOC.  However, interactions are possible between active ingredients in eye drops and other medications.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The effects of SOC on pregnancy and lactation are not well-established due to the lack of dedicated studies, reflecting its limited systemic absorption. Consult a doctor if pregnant or breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Generates reactive oxygen species that disrupt microbial function.
- **Side Effects:** Generally well-tolerated; potential for mild ocular irritation and rare hypersensitivity.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to SOC.
- **Drug Interactions:**  No significant interactions known specifically for SOC.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult a doctor if pregnant or breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** Not independently dosed; follow the active ingredient's dosage guidelines.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Ocular irritation.


## **Popular Combinations**

SOC is found in numerous ophthalmic solutions combined with active ingredients like:

- **Sodium hyaluronate:** For dry eye syndrome.
- **Carboxymethylcellulose:** For dry eye syndrome.
- **Brimonidine tartrate:** For glaucoma.
- **Atropine:** For myopia control.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Discontinue use if significant irritation develops and consult an ophthalmologist.  Avoid touching the dropper tip to any surface to prevent contamination.
- **Specific Populations:** No specific precautions for elderly, renal/hepatic impairment, or children, relating specifically to SOC as a preservative.
