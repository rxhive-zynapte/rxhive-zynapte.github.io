## **Usage**

- Oxymetazoline is primarily prescribed for the temporary relief of nasal congestion associated with the common cold, hay fever, sinusitis, and other upper respiratory allergies.  It can also be used to relieve nasal congestion caused by sinus infections or allergic rhinitis.  In ophthalmic formulations, it is used for acquired blepharoptosis (drooping eyelid).  A topical formulation is available for the treatment of persistent facial erythema associated with rosacea.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Decongestant, alpha-2 adrenergic agonist.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Oxymetazoline acts as a selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, causing vasoconstriction in the nasal mucosa. This reduces blood flow and swelling, thereby relieving congestion.

## **Alternate Names**

- Oxymetazoline hydrochloride.
- **Brand Names:** Afrin, Drixine, Nasivion, Otrivin, Vicks Sinex, ClariClear.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Oxymetazoline primarily stimulates alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the nasal mucosa, leading to vasoconstriction.  This effect reduces mucosal edema and congestion.  It also has weak alpha-1 adrenergic agonist activity. Systemic effects such as elevated blood pressure can occur with excessive or prolonged use.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  When administered intranasally, oxymetazoline is absorbed to some extent, although the majority of the drug remains localized in the nasal mucosa.  Limited information is available regarding its metabolism and elimination pathways.  It is thought that very little of the medication passes into breast milk.
- **Mode of Action:**  Oxymetazoline binds to alpha-2 adrenergic receptors on the vascular smooth muscle cells of the nasal mucosa. This binding activates a signaling cascade that results in vasoconstriction.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Primarily binds to alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. Systemic effects can result from some binding to alpha-1 receptors. The drug does not have significant effects on enzyme systems or neurotransmitter modulation in its normal usage.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  The precise pathways are not fully elucidated, but hepatic metabolism and renal excretion likely play a role.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Nasal Spray/Drops (0.05%):** 2-3 sprays/drops in each nostril every 10-12 hours. Do not exceed two doses in 24 hours. Limit use to 3-5 days to avoid rebound congestion.
- **Ophthalmic Solution (0.1%):** 1 drop in the affected eye once daily.
- **Topical Cream (1%):**  Apply a pea-sized amount to the entire face once daily.

#### **Children:**

- **Nasal Drops (0.025%):** Children 2-5 years: 1-2 drops in each nostril twice daily.
- **Nasal Spray/Drops (0.05%):** Children 6 years and older: Same as adult dose, with adult supervision.
- **Ophthalmic Solution (0.1%):** Children younger than 13 years:  Use and dose must be determined by a doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to potential for cardiovascular side effects. No specific dose adjustments are typically recommended, but close monitoring is advised.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution.  Dose adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution.  Dose adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use cautiously in patients with hypertension, cardiac disease, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, or angle-closure glaucoma.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Oxymetazoline's clinical use is primarily limited to relieving nasal congestion. While it can facilitate certain procedures (e.g., intubation) by improving nasal access, it does not have specific dosing guidelines for these settings. Its use during surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU care should be determined by the clinician based on the individual patient's needs.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dosage adjustments should be considered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Start with a lower dose and titrate based on response and tolerance.

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

- Burning or stinging in the nose
- Sneezing
- Runny nose
- Dryness inside the nose

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Fast, irregular, or pounding heartbeat
- Headache, dizziness
- Tremors
- Difficulty sleeping

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Rebound congestion (with prolonged use, exceeding 3-5 days)
- Atrophic rhinitis
- Anosmia

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Allergic reactions (skin rash, itching, hives, facial swelling)
- Hypertensive crisis (especially with concomitant use of MAOIs)
- Cardiac arrhythmias


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to oxymetazoline
- Angle-closure glaucoma (for ophthalmic use)
- Patients taking or who have taken monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) within the past 14 days
- Trans-sphenoidal hypophysectomy or other nasal surgery exposing the dura mater
- Rhinitis sicca
- Acute coronary disease, cardiac asthma, cardiac arrhythmias


## **Drug Interactions**

- **MAOIs:** Concurrent or recent use can cause severe hypertension.
- **Tricyclic Antidepressants:**  May increase the risk of cardiovascular side effects.
- **Other Sympathomimetics (e.g., decongestants, stimulants):** Additive effects, increased risk of hypertension and tachycardia.
- **Beta-Blockers:** May cause paradoxical hypertension or worsen pre-existing hypertension.
- **Methyldopa:**  May inhibit antihypertensive effect and cause rebound hypertension.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C.  While not well-studied in pregnancy, the risk of significant fetal exposure is thought to be low due to minimal systemic absorption. Use only if clearly needed and for short durations.
- **Breastfeeding:**  While not well-studied, it is likely that very little oxymetazoline passes into breast milk due to its topical administration. Use only if clearly needed and for short durations. Consider using nasal decongestants instead of oral decongestants.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Alpha-2 adrenergic agonist causing vasoconstriction of nasal mucosa.
- **Side Effects:**  Nasal burning/stinging, sneezing, dryness, rebound congestion (with prolonged use), rare cardiovascular effects.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, angle-closure glaucoma (ophthalmic), concurrent or recent MAOI use, trans-sphenoidal hypophysectomy.
- **Drug Interactions:** MAOIs, tricyclic antidepressants, other sympathomimetics, beta-blockers.
