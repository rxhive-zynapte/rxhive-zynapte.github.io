## **Usage**

- Oxyphenbutazone is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) indicated for the symptomatic relief of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and gout.  It was also prescribed for other painful musculoskeletal conditions. However, it's use has been restricted significantly.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID), Analgesic, Antipyretic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Oxyphenbutazone primarily inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, responsible for prostaglandin synthesis. Prostaglandins mediate inflammation, pain, and fever. By inhibiting COX, oxyphenbutazone reduces prostaglandin production, thus alleviating these symptoms.

## **Alternate Names**

- p-Hydroxyphenylbutazone
- **Brand Names:** Tandearil (withdrawn from the market in many countries due to serious side effects).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Oxyphenbutazone exerts its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects through COX inhibition, reducing prostaglandin synthesis.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Absorption: Rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 2-4 hours.
    - Metabolism: Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by oxidation and conjugation with glucuronic acid. A major active metabolite is gamma-hydroxyphenylbutazone.
    - Elimination: Excreted primarily in urine as metabolites, with a small amount eliminated in feces. The elimination half-life is approximately 70 hours, but this varies considerably among individuals.
- **Mode of Action:**  Inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, thereby reducing prostaglandin production.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation**:  Primarily inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.
- **Elimination Pathways**: Primarily renal excretion of metabolites, with some hepatic excretion.

## **Dosage**

**Please note:** Due to the potential for serious side effects, oxyphenbutazone use is severely restricted. The information below reflects historical dosage practices and should not be interpreted as current recommendations. Consult local guidelines for the most up-to-date information.


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Historically, the initial adult dosage ranged from 200-600 mg/day, divided into multiple doses. Due to the risk of toxicity, it was advised to promptly reduce the dosage to the lowest effective level for maintenance, not to exceed 400 mg/day. 

#### **Children:**

Due to potential risks, oxyphenbutazone is generally contraindicated in children under 14 years of age.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: Due to an increased risk of toxicity, oxyphenbutazone use is generally avoided in the elderly. If deemed necessary, use lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Contraindicated in severe renal impairment. Reduce dosage in mild to moderate impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Contraindicated in severe hepatic dysfunction. Adjust dosage based on liver function.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or hematological disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Previously, oxyphenbutazone might have been used in some of these settings. It is crucial to emphasize that its use in such situations is currently highly restricted or contraindicated due to safety concerns. Please consult updated local guidelines for appropriate therapeutic options.

- **Surgical Procedures:** Not recommended.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not recommended.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Not recommended.
- **Emergency Situations:** Not recommended.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on patient factors such as renal/hepatic function, age, and response to therapy. Monitor for adverse effects. Given its restricted use, consultation with a specialist is crucial if oxyphenbutazone is considered.

## **Precautions**

- Evaluate renal and hepatic function, cardiovascular status, and gastrointestinal history before initiating therapy.
- Close monitoring for adverse events, especially during long-term use.
- Caution in patients with pre-existing medical conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and heart failure.
