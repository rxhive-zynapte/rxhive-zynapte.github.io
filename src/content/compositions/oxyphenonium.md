## **Usage**

- Oxyphenonium is prescribed for the treatment of peptic ulcers and to prevent muscle spasms in the gastrointestinal tract. It is also used to relieve visceral spasms in other internal organs such as the bladder, uterus, or rectum.  It is effective in managing conditions marked by excessive smooth muscle activity and secretion within the gastrointestinal system. For example, it can help reduce painful cramps linked to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and decrease gastric acid secretion in peptic ulcer disease.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Anticholinergic, Antimuscarinic agent, Antispasmodic.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:**  Oxyphenonium bromide.
- **Brand Names:** Antrenyl, Ulpane, Antrenyl Duplex.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Oxyphenonium bromide, an anticholinergic drug, diminishes the effects of acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter that stimulates muscles) by blocking muscarinic receptors on smooth muscle cells. It exerts a direct relaxing effect on these muscles, primarily within the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts.  This action reduces gastrointestinal motility and gastric acid secretion and controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal and bronchial secretions.  This mechanism is the reason for its clinical efficacy in treating gastrointestinal spasm and hypermotility, cardiospasm, esophagospasm, gastroduodenitis, spastic constipation, pylorospasm, peptic ulcer, spasm associated with carcinoma. It also helps alleviate pain and spasm in the biliary and urinary tracts. 
- **Pharmacokinetics:** The drug is well-absorbed from the GI tract after oral administration.  Peak plasma concentration is reached approximately 1-2 hours post-ingestion.  The elimination pathways are not fully elucidated, but both hepatic and renal routes are likely involved.
- **Mode of Action:** Oxyphenonium competitively antagonizes the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, particularly M1 and M3 subtypes.  This inhibits the binding of acetylcholine, preventing activation of smooth muscle contraction and glandular secretion.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  As noted, the main mechanism is competitive antagonism of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 5-10 mg, three to four times daily before meals.  The dosage can be adjusted based on the patient's response and the severity of the condition.

#### **Children:**

- 3-5 mg per day. Pediatric dosing needs careful adjustment according to the child's weight and age.  

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Begin with a lower dose and adjust cautiously based on response and tolerance.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce the dosage to avoid accumulation. Consider the patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR) when adjusting.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Reduce the dosage as there is a risk of impaired metabolism. 
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dose adjustment might be needed based on coexisting medical problems such as glaucoma, cardiovascular disease, or prostate enlargement.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Dosage adjustments are needed for specific clinical situations. It is important to consult specialized resources and current guidelines for precise recommendations in these contexts.
- **Intubation:** Adjust dose to minimize secretions.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Used to decrease secretions and vagal reflexes.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Used to manage secretions.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Dosage varies based on specific patient needs.
- **Emergency Situations:** Adjust dosage as necessary based on the acute condition.  

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose modifications are necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  Consider genetic polymorphisms that could affect drug metabolism.


## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects**

- Dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention, dizziness, headache, tachycardia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (e.g., rash, itching, swelling), acute glaucoma, severe urinary retention, paralytic ileus, confusion, hallucinations.

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Potential complications from prolonged use include chronic constipation, urinary problems, and cognitive impairment, particularly in elderly patients.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
