      Can I consume dairy products with this medicine?**

      **A:** No. Dairy products, including milk, can chelate with
      oxytetracycline, significantly reducing its absorption. It's advised to
      avoid dairy products an hour before and two hours after taking
      oxytetracycline.

## **Usage**

Oxytetracycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribed for various bacterial infections. These include infections of the respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin, ear, eye, and sexually transmitted infections like gonorrhea. It is also effective against rickettsial infections (like typhus and Rocky Mountain spotted fever), brucellosis, cholera, tularemia, and infections caused by Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, and Rickettsia. It serves as an alternative when penicillin or macrolides cannot be used due to allergies.  It is classified as a tetracycline antibiotic.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic

**Mechanism of Action:** Oxytetracycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding reversibly to the 30S ribosomal subunit, blocking the attachment of aminoacyl-tRNA to the acceptor site on the mRNA-ribosome complex. This prevents the addition of amino acids to the elongating peptide chain, halting bacterial growth.

## **Alternate Names**

Oxytetracycline Hydrochloride,  Terramycin (brand name - no longer available in the US)

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Oxytetracycline exerts a bacteriostatic effect by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Incompletely and irregularly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, reduced by food, milk, and antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium.
* **Distribution:** Widely distributed throughout the body, crossing the placenta and entering breast milk.
* **Metabolism:** Partially metabolized in the liver.
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted in urine and feces, with some biliary excretion.

**Mode of Action:**  Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit.

**Elimination Pathways:** Renal and fecal excretion, some biliary excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 250-500 mg every six hours.  Doses up to 1-2 grams divided into four doses may be used for severe infections.

#### **Children:** Generally not recommended for children under 8 years old due to the risk of permanent tooth discoloration. For children over 8 years: 25â€“50 mg/kg/day divided into four equal doses.  

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Standard adult dose. Caution is advised due to potential subclinical renal insufficiency.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Contraindicated unless absolutely necessary. Dosage reduction and/or extended intervals between doses are required if used.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in severe liver disease. Caution recommended in mild to moderate impairment. 
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No explicit dosage adjustments mentioned except for considerations related to renal/hepatic impairment.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage information for the specific listed clinical settings (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations) is not available from the sources provided. Dosages mentioned relate to specific infections.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

* **Renal Impairment:** Dosage reduction required.
* **Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage reduction in moderate cases, contraindicated in severe disease.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, upset stomach, photosensitivity, skin rash.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Anaphylaxis, hepatotoxicity (hepatitis, jaundice, hepatic failure), intracranial hypertension, pancreatitis (high doses), blood disorders (hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, eosinophilia), pericarditis.


### **Long-Term Effects**
Permanent tooth discoloration (yellow-gray-brown) and enamel hypoplasia, especially in children under 8 years of age, pregnant women in their second or third trimester, and with prolonged use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Anaphylaxis, severe skin reactions, hepatotoxicity, blood disorders, intracranial hypertension.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to tetracyclines, severe liver/kidney disease, porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), pregnancy (especially second and third trimester), children under 8 years old, concurrent use of vitamin A or retinoids.

## **Drug Interactions**

Antacids (aluminum, calcium, magnesium), iron supplements, bismuth subsalicylate, milk and dairy products, oral contraceptives, anticoagulants (warfarin), digoxin, lithium, methotrexate, retinoids (isotretinoin, acitretin).

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy Safety Category:** Contraindicated, especially during the second and third trimesters, due to risk of permanent tooth discoloration and skeletal development issues in the fetus.

**Breastfeeding:** Short-term use is generally considered acceptable, though prolonged use should be avoided as a precaution.

## **Popular Combinations**

No specific popular drug combinations are mentioned in the provided sources. However, it is sometimes used in combination with streptomycin for brucellosis.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess renal and hepatic function before and during prolonged therapy. Monitor for signs of hypersensitivity. Advise patients to avoid excessive sun exposure.
* **Specific Populations:**  Avoid in pregnancy, caution in breastfeeding. Not recommended for children under 8 years old. Use with caution in the elderly and those with renal impairment.
