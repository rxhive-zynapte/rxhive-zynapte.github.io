      What is the recommended dosage for Oxytocin?**


      **A:** The dosage is highly individualized based on uterine response.  For
      labor induction/augmentation, the initial dose is 0.5-1 milliunits/min IV,
      increased gradually until desired contraction pattern is achieved. For
      postpartum bleeding, 10 units IM or 10-40 units in IV solution. For
      incomplete/inevitable abortion, 10-20 milliunits/min IV.

## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Oxytocin is prescribed for labor induction, augmentation of labor, control of postpartum bleeding (prevention and treatment), and incomplete or inevitable abortion. It is also used to assist in milk letdown.  
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Uterotonic Agent, Hormone
- **Mechanism of Action:** Oxytocin stimulates contraction of the uterine smooth muscle by increasing intracellular calcium levels, which enhances the formation of actomyosin, the contractile protein. It binds to specific myometrial receptors, the concentration of which increases during pregnancy.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:** Syntocinon, Pitocin
- **Brand Names:** Pitocin

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Oxytocin causes rhythmic contractions of the uterine smooth muscle, similar to those seen in spontaneous labor. It has mild antidiuretic properties similar to vasopressin.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). IV administration results in almost immediate uterine response, while IM injection has an onset within 3-5 minutes.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver and kidneys by oxytocinase.
    - **Elimination:** Metabolites are excreted in the urine. Less than 1% is excreted unchanged in the urine. Plasma half-life is 1 to 6 minutes, shorter during late pregnancy and lactation.
- **Mode of Action:** Binds to oxytocin receptors in the myometrium, activating phospholipase C, which increases intracellular calcium levels, leading to uterine muscle contraction.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Binds to G protein-coupled oxytocin receptors, leading to increased intracellular calcium via inositol trisphosphate pathway.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Renal and hepatic metabolism and excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Labor Induction/Augmentation:** Initial dose of 0.5-1 milliunits/min (3-6 mL/hour of a 10 milliunits/mL solution) IV.  Increase by 1-2 milliunits/min every 30-60 minutes until desired contraction pattern is established. After reaching active labor (5-6 cm dilation), the dose may be reduced. Maximum dose is generally 20 milliunits/min, may go up to 40 milliunits/min in certain cases.
- **Postpartum Bleeding (Prevention):** 10 units IM after placental delivery, or 5 units slow IV push over 5 minutes, or 5-10 IU by i.v. infusion (5 IU diluted in physiological electrolyte solution and administered as an i.v. drip infusion over 5 minutes).
- **Postpartum Bleeding (Treatment):** 10-40 units in 500-1000 mL IV solution infused at a rate to control uterine atony.
- **Incomplete/Inevitable Abortion:** 10-20 milliunits/min IV infusion; not to exceed 30 units in a 12-hour period.


#### **Children:** No established pediatric dosing guidelines.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Limited data; use with caution.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No specific dosage adjustments; use with caution due to potential for accumulation and prolonged action.
