## **Usage**

Palbociclib is prescribed for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. It is used in combination with:

* An aromatase inhibitor (e.g., letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane) as initial endocrine-based therapy in postmenopausal women or men.
* Fulvestrant in patients with disease progression following endocrine therapy.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Palbociclib is a kinase inhibitor, specifically a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6 inhibitor.

**Mechanism of Action:** Palbociclib works by inhibiting CDK 4 and 6, which are key regulators of the cell cycle. By inhibiting these kinases, palbociclib blocks cell cycle progression in cancer cells, ultimately leading to reduced tumor growth.



## **Alternate Names**

**International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** palbociclib

**Brand Name:** Ibrance



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Palbociclib exerts its anti-cancer effects by primarily inhibiting CDK4/6, leading to cell cycle arrest and ultimately tumor regression.  This effect is particularly pronounced in HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer cells.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Palbociclib is administered orally and is best absorbed when taken with food.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by CYP3A and sulfotransferase (SULT) enzyme SULT2A1 in the liver. Palbociclib is also a weak time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated via feces, with a small portion excreted in urine.

**Mode of Action:** Palbociclib selectively inhibits CDK4/6, leading to G1 cell cycle arrest by preventing the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb). This prevents DNA replication and cell division in susceptible cancer cells.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Palbociclib directly inhibits CDK4/6 kinase activity.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily fecal excretion (approximately 73%), with minor renal excretion (approximately 17%).



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The recommended dose is 125 mg orally once daily, taken with food, for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment (Schedule 3/1) to complete a 28-day cycle.

#### **Children:**  The safety and efficacy of Palbociclib in children and adolescents ≤18 years of age have not been established. No data are available.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients (≥65 years):** No dose adjustment is required.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment needed for mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] ≥15 mL/min). Insufficient data are available for patients requiring hemodialysis.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
    * Mild or moderate impairment (Child-Pugh A or B): No dose adjustment required.
    * Severe impairment (Child-Pugh C): Reduce dose to 75 mg daily.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor closely for adverse events, particularly myelosuppression, in patients with pre-existing conditions.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Palbociclib's clinical use is specifically focused on HR-positive, HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.  Its use is not indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose reductions (to 100 mg or 75 mg daily) are recommended based on individual patient tolerance and the severity of adverse events, primarily myelosuppression (neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia).



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, infections, fatigue, nausea, alopecia, stomatitis, diarrhea, vomiting, decreased appetite, arthralgia, rash.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, severe myelosuppression with febrile neutropenia, hepatotoxicity, venous thromboembolism.

### **Long-Term Effects:**  Long-term side effects are still being investigated. However, prolonged myelosuppression can increase the risk of infection.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Serious ADRs requiring immediate intervention include severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, ILD/pneumonitis, and hepatotoxicity.





## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to palbociclib, concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin).



## **Drug Interactions**

* **CYP3A Inhibitors:** Strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice) can significantly increase palbociclib plasma concentrations. Coadministration should be avoided, or the palbociclib dose should be reduced if unavoidable.
* **CYP3A Inducers:** Strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin) can decrease palbociclib concentrations. Coadministration should be avoided.
* **Other Interactions:**  Palbociclib may increase the exposure of sensitive CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., alfentanil, cyclosporine).



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Pregnancy Category D (Australia); Not assigned (US FDA).  Palbociclib can cause fetal harm.  Effective contraception is mandatory during treatment and for 3 weeks after the last dose for women and 14 weeks after the last dose for men.

**Breastfeeding:** Palbociclib is present in breast milk and may cause serious adverse reactions in infants.  Breastfeeding is contraindicated during treatment and for 3 weeks after the last dose.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** CDK4/6 inhibitor, blocks cell cycle progression.
* **Side Effects:** Neutropenia, leukopenia, infections, fatigue, nausea, alopecia.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, strong CYP3A inducers.
* **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A inhibitors and inducers.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
* **Dosage:** 125 mg orally daily x 21 days, then 7 days off, in a 28-day cycle.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Complete blood counts (CBCs), liver function tests.

* Palbociclib + Letrozole
* Palbociclib + Fulvestrant



## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Monitor CBCs, liver function.
* **Specific Populations:**  See sections on Pregnancy and Breastfeeding, Elderly patients, and patients with renal/hepatic impairment.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice. Exercise caution when driving or operating machinery due to potential fatigue and dizziness.
