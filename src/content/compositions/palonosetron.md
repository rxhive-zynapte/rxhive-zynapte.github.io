## Usage

Palonosetron is primarily prescribed for the prevention of nausea and vomiting, specifically:

*   **Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV):**  Used for both acute and delayed CINV associated with moderately and highly emetogenic chemotherapy.
*   **Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV):**  Effective for preventing PONV for up to 24 hours following surgery.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Palonosetron is classified as a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, a type of antiemetic.

**Mechanism of Action:** Palonosetron works by selectively blocking serotonin-3 (5-HT<sub>3</sub>) receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), particularly in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) and the vagal afferents in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.  This action inhibits serotonin, a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in the initiation of the vomiting reflex.

## Alternate Names

*   Generic Name: Palonosetron hydrochloride
*   Brand Names: Aloxi®, Akynzeo® (in combination with netupitant)

## How It Works

**Pharmacodynamics:** Palonosetron exerts its antiemetic effect by antagonizing 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors. It has a high affinity for these receptors and a long duration of action, which contributes to its efficacy in preventing both acute and delayed nausea and vomiting.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:**  After intravenous administration, palonosetron is rapidly absorbed and distributed.
*   **Metabolism:** Palonosetron is primarily metabolized in the liver via multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, including CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP1A2.
*   **Elimination:**  Palonosetron is eliminated through both renal (urine) and hepatic (bile) routes. It has a relatively long elimination half-life (approximately 40 hours), allowing for once-daily dosing.

**Mode of Action:** Palonosetron binds to 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors, preventing serotonin from binding and activating these receptors. This blocks the initiation of the vomiting reflex.

**Elimination Pathways:** Palonosetron is eliminated through both renal and hepatic pathways, including metabolism by CYP enzymes.

## Dosage

### Standard Dosage

#### Adults:

*   **CINV:** 0.25 mg IV administered over 30 seconds, approximately 30 minutes before chemotherapy.
*   **PONV:** 0.075 mg IV administered over 10 seconds, immediately before induction of anesthesia.

#### Children:

*   **CINV:** 20 mcg/kg (maximum 1.5 mg) IV infused over 15 minutes, approximately 30 minutes before chemotherapy.
*   **PONV:**  Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients for PONV.

#### Special Cases:

*   **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment is not generally necessary.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment is not required.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment is not required.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  No specific dose adjustments are routinely recommended, but clinical judgment should be exercised.

### Clinical Use Cases

*   **Intubation:**  Palonosetron can be used to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with intubation procedures.
*   **Surgical Procedures:** It is effective for preventing PONV following various surgical procedures.
*   **Mechanical Ventilation:**  Can be used in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation to prevent nausea and vomiting.
*   **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** May be used in ICU settings to manage nausea and vomiting.
*   **Emergency Situations:**  Not typically used in acute emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.


### Dosage Adjustments

No routine dosage adjustments are recommended for renal or hepatic impairment, elderly patients, or patients with comorbid conditions. However, individualized dosing may be considered based on patient-specific factors and clinical judgment.


## Side Effects

### Common Side Effects:

*   Headache
*   Constipation
*   Dizziness

### Rare but Serious Side Effects:

*   Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock)
*   QT interval prolongation
*   Serotonin syndrome

### Long-Term Effects:

Limited data are available on long-term effects.

### Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):

Clinically significant ADRs include hypersensitivity reactions and QT prolongation, requiring immediate intervention.

## Contraindications

*   Hypersensitivity to palonosetron or any of its components.

## Drug Interactions

*   Drugs that prolong the QT interval should be used with caution.
*   Serotonergic drugs may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome.


## Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

*   **Pregnancy:** Palonosetron should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.
*   **Breastfeeding:**  It is unknown if palonosetron is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when administering to breastfeeding mothers.


## Drug Profile Summary

*   **Mechanism of Action:** 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist.
*   **Side Effects:** Headache, constipation, dizziness, hypersensitivity reactions, QT prolongation.
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to palonosetron.
*   **Drug Interactions:** QT prolonging drugs, serotonergic drugs.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution.
*   **Dosage:** Refer to the Dosage section above.
*   **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for hypersensitivity reactions, QT prolongation, and serotonin syndrome.

## Popular Combinations

Palonosetron is often used in combination with dexamethasone for enhanced antiemetic efficacy, especially in the setting of highly emetogenic chemotherapy.

## Precautions

*   **General Precautions:**  Pre-screening for allergies and cardiac conditions, especially those associated with QT prolongation, is recommended.
*   **Specific Populations:**  Use cautiously in pregnant or breastfeeding women, elderly patients, and those with cardiac conditions.
*   **Lifestyle Considerations:**  No specific lifestyle restrictions are generally associated with palonosetron use.
