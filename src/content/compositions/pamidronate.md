## **Usage**

Pamidronate is prescribed for the following medical conditions:

*   **Hypercalcemia of Malignancy:**  Elevated blood calcium levels associated with cancer.
*   **Osteolytic Bone Metastases:** Bone lesions caused by the spread of cancer.
*   **Multiple Myeloma:** A cancer of plasma cells in the bone marrow.
*   **Paget's Disease of Bone:** A chronic bone disorder that disrupts the normal cycle of bone breakdown and rebuilding.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Pamidronate is classified as a bisphosphonate.

**Mechanism of Action:** Pamidronate inhibits osteoclast activity, the cells responsible for bone resorption.  This reduces bone breakdown and turnover, lowering serum calcium levels in hypercalcemia and decreasing skeletal complications from metastases and myeloma.



## **Alternate Names**

*   **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Pamidronate disodium
*   **Brand Names:** Aredia, Pamisol, Medac Disodium Pamidronate, pms-PAMIDRONATE (and others, depending on the region)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Pamidronate primarily acts on bone tissue by inhibiting osteoclast activity.  It binds to hydroxyapatite crystals in bone, preventing their dissolution and reducing bone resorption.  This leads to a decrease in serum calcium levels.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Administered intravenously, so absorption is not applicable in the traditional sense.  The drug rapidly distributes to bone tissue.
*   **Metabolism:** Minimal hepatic metabolism.
*   **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion of the unchanged drug.


**Mode of Action:** Pamidronate's mode of action involves binding to hydroxyapatite crystals in bone.  While the exact mechanism isn't fully understood, it's believed to interfere with osteoclast function by:

*   Disrupting intracellular signaling pathways necessary for osteoclast formation and activity.
*   Promoting osteoclast apoptosis (programmed cell death).
*   Impairing osteoclast adhesion to the bone surface.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Pamidronate does not primarily act through receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation. Its main effect is through direct interaction with bone mineral and interference with osteoclast activity.

**Elimination Pathways:** Pamidronate is primarily eliminated via renal excretion as the unchanged drug.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   **Hypercalcemia of Malignancy:**
    *   Moderate (corrected serum calcium 12-13.5 mg/dL): 60-90 mg as a single intravenous infusion over 2-24 hours.
    *   Severe (corrected serum calcium >13.5 mg/dL): 90 mg as a single intravenous infusion over 2-24 hours.
*   **Osteolytic Bone Metastases/Multiple Myeloma:** 90 mg intravenous infusion every 4 weeks (may be given every 3 weeks to coincide with chemotherapy).
*   **Paget's Disease:** 180-210 mg total dose per course.  May be given as 30 mg once weekly for 6 weeks or 60 mg every other week for 3 doses.

#### **Children:**

*   Dosing for children is not standardized and should be determined on a case-by-case basis by the physician.
*   Limited data suggest a range of 1-1.5 mg/kg/day for several consecutive days, usually given as a slow infusion.
*   Careful monitoring of serum calcium and other electrolytes is crucial in pediatric patients.


#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:**  Dose adjustments are not typically required, but close monitoring of renal function is advised. Start at lower dose ranges and monitor for adverse reactions.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    *   Mild to Moderate: No dose adjustment necessary.
    *   Severe (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min): Avoid use unless benefits outweigh risks.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment needed for mild to moderate impairment. Use with caution in severe hepatic dysfunction.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor closely and adjust as needed based on individual patient factors.



### **Clinical Use Cases**  Pamidronate's intravenous route is mainly indicated for conditions affecting bone metabolism or calcium homeostasis, rather than clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or emergency scenarios. Its slow infusion administration and specific therapeutic actions are not generally suited for these acute care settings.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be necessary for renal or hepatic impairment as outlined above.  Closely monitor patients with other conditions impacting drug clearance or calcium balance.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Fever, fatigue, flu-like symptoms
*   Gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, constipation, anorexia)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Ocular inflammation (uveitis, scleritis)
*   Atrial fibrillation
*   Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ)
*   Renal impairment
