      Can I open the capsules and sprinkle the contents on food?**


      **A:**  If the patient cannot swallow capsules, it's possible to open them
      and mix the contents with a small amount of acidic soft food (pH < 4.5),
      like applesauce, but not alkaline foods. Take the mixture immediately
      without chewing the granules.  Ensure complete ingestion by following with
      liquid.

## **Usage**

Pancreatin is prescribed for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), a condition where the pancreas doesn't produce enough enzymes to digest food properly. This can occur in conditions like cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatectomy (surgical removal of the pancreas), and other conditions that affect pancreatic function.  It belongs to the pharmacological classification of digestive enzymes.

Pancreatin works by supplementing the body's natural pancreatic enzymes, thereby aiding in the digestion of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.

## **Alternate Names**

While "pancreatin" is the standard generic name, other variations exist depending on the specific formulation or brand. Some alternate names include pancrelipase, amylase/lipase/protease, and Pancreatin BP.  Brand names under which pancreatin is marketed include Creon, Pancreaze, Pertzye, Zenpep, Viokace, and Enzystal-P.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Pancreatin provides exogenous pancreatic enzymes, including lipases, proteases, and amylases, compensating for the deficiency in EPI.  These enzymes break down fats into fatty acids and glycerol, proteins into amino acids and peptides, and carbohydrates into simpler sugars in the duodenum (small intestine).  This facilitates nutrient absorption, reducing symptoms of EPI like steatorrhea (fatty stools), abdominal pain, and weight loss.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Pancreatin is administered orally, typically as delayed-release capsules or tablets. The enteric coating protects the enzymes from degradation by stomach acid, allowing their release in the alkaline environment of the duodenum, the optimal pH for enzyme activity. The enzymes are not absorbed systemically but act locally within the intestinal lumen. The undigested portion of the enzymes, along with the digested food, is eliminated through the gastrointestinal tract.

**Mode of Action:** Pancreatin's enzymes act directly on food substrates. Lipases hydrolyze ester bonds in triglycerides, proteases cleave peptide bonds in proteins, and amylases hydrolyze glycosidic bonds in starches. These enzymes do not involve receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation in their mechanism of action.


## **Dosage**

Dosage is highly individualized and based on patient factors such as age, body weight, severity of EPI, dietary fat intake, and specific product formulation. It's crucial to monitor patient response, including stool characteristics and nutritional status, to optimize dosing.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  The initial dose is typically 500 lipase units/kg body weight per meal, often administered as 1-2 capsules of a specific strength.  The dosage can be adjusted as needed, generally not exceeding 2500 lipase units/kg/meal or 10,000 lipase units/kg/day.  For snacks, approximately half of the mealtime dose is recommended.

#### **Children:**  Dosing in children varies by age and body weight, generally starting higher per kg than adult doses due to higher fat intake proportional to weight:

- **Infants (0-12 months):** 2000-5000 lipase units per feeding (or per 120 mL of formula/breast milk)
- **Children (1-3 years):** 1000 lipase units/kg/meal
- **Children (â‰¥4 years):** 500 lipase units/kg/meal


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** May require lower doses due to decreased fat intake and potential changes in gastrointestinal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments aren't typically required, as pancreatin isn't renally cleared.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose modifications are not typically needed, as hepatic clearance is not the primary route of elimination.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Conditions like gout, asthma, and cystic fibrosis may require careful monitoring and dose adjustment. Patients with cystic fibrosis are particularly susceptible to fibrosing colonopathy at high doses.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Pancreatin dosing is primarily determined by the underlying cause of EPI (cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatectomy) and the patient's dietary intake, not by specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Diarrhea
- Abdominal pain/cramps
- Flatulence
- Mild skin rash

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
- Fibrosing colonopathy (primarily in cystic fibrosis patients receiving high doses)
- Hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels in the blood)
- Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis (rare but potentially life-threatening)
- Perianal irritation or inflammation

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to pork protein (as pancreatin is often derived from porcine sources)
- Acute pancreatitis
- Acute exacerbations of chronic pancreatitis



## **Drug Interactions**

Pancreatin may interact with:

- Iron supplements: Decreased iron absorption.
- Folic acid: Decreased folic acid absorption.
- Calcium carbonate and antacids: May reduce pancreatin effectiveness.
- Acarbose and miglitol (diabetes medications): May further lower blood sugar when taken with pancreatin.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  FDA Pregnancy Category C:  Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.  Adequate human studies are lacking.
- **Breastfeeding:**  It's unknown if pancreatin passes into breast milk.  Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Replaces deficient pancreatic enzymes, aiding digestion.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, rare but serious effects include fibrosing colonopathy and hyperuricemia.
- **Contraindications:** Pork protein hypersensitivity, acute pancreatitis, acute exacerbations of chronic pancreatitis.
- **Drug Interactions:** Iron, folic acid, calcium carbonate, antacids, acarbose, miglitol.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks. Insufficient data available.
- **Dosage:** Highly individualized based on patient and disease factors. Consult dosage guidelines above.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Stool consistency, frequency, and fat content; nutritional status (weight, growth in children); abdominal symptoms; uric acid levels (especially in high-dose therapy).

## **Popular Combinations**

Pancreatin is often prescribed in conjunction with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to reduce gastric acid secretion and improve enzyme effectiveness.

## **Precautions**

- Ensure adequate hydration.
- Monitor for and report any unusual abdominal symptoms, especially in cystic fibrosis patients on high doses.
- Avoid crushing or chewing delayed-release capsules or tablets.
- Administer with meals and snacks.
- Adjust dose based on individual needs and dietary fat intake.
