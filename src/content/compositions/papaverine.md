## **Usage**

Papaverine is a vasodilator, primarily indicated for the treatment of various conditions involving spasms of smooth muscle. These include:

* **Vascular spasm:** Associated with conditions like acute myocardial infarction (coronary occlusion), angina pectoris, peripheral and pulmonary embolism, peripheral vascular disease with a vasospastic component, and certain cerebral angiospastic states.
* **Visceral spasm:** Such as ureteral, biliary, or gastrointestinal colic.

It has also been used off-label for erectile dysfunction (ED) through intracavernosal injection, but this is not an FDA-approved indication and carries risks.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Vasodilator, smooth muscle relaxant.

**Mechanism of Action:** Papaverine inhibits phosphodiesterase, leading to increased levels of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP within smooth muscle cells. This results in smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation, improving blood flow.


## **Alternate Names**

Papaverine hydrochloride.
Numerous brand names exist internationally, varying by region.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Papaverine relaxes smooth muscle, causing vasodilation and reducing spasms in blood vessels and visceral organs. This leads to improved blood flow and relief of ischemic symptoms.  High doses can depress myocardial function.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:**  Oral absorption is approximately 54%.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily hepatic.
* **Elimination:**  Renal excretion.

**Mode of Action:** Papaverine inhibits phosphodiesterase, leading to increased intracellular cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP.  It is not related to nerve blockade or adrenergic receptor activity.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily hepatic metabolism followed by renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral (extended-release capsules):**  150 mg every 12 hours, which can be increased to 150 mg every 8 hours or 300 mg every 12 hours.
* **IV/IM:** 30 to 120 mg every 3 hours as needed, administered slowly over 1-2 minutes.

#### **Children:**

Safety and efficacy not fully established. Dosages of 6 mg/kg/day divided into four IV or IM doses have been used.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  May require lower doses due to age-related decline in organ function. Careful monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Reduce dosage as needed due to impaired metabolism.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Exercise caution in patients with heart conditions, glaucoma, or AV block.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage guidelines for these clinical situations vary widely based on specific patient needs and the severity of the condition.  Consult relevant guidelines and specialist literature for specific dosage recommendations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage modifications are crucial based on patient factors such as renal or hepatic dysfunction, and concomitant medications. Careful monitoring of vital signs and adverse effects is necessary to adjust the dose appropriately.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, abdominal distress, anorexia, constipation, malaise, drowsiness, vertigo, sweating, headache, diarrhea, skin rash, flushing, increased heart rate and respiratory rate, slight increase in blood pressure.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Hepatic hypersensitivity (jaundice, eosinophilia, altered liver function tests), AV block, cardiac arrhythmias, severe hypotension, priapism (with intracavernosal injection), allergic reactions (hives, difficulty breathing, swelling).

### **Long-Term Effects**

Priapism and penile fibrosis (with chronic intracavernosal use).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, severe cardiovascular effects (hypotension, arrhythmias), hepatotoxicity.


## **Contraindications**

* Complete atrioventricular heart block.
* Hypersensitivity to papaverine.
* Intracorporeal injection for impotence is contraindicated due to the risk of priapism.


## **Drug Interactions**

Papaverine interacts with numerous medications, including those affecting blood pressure, sedatives, anticoagulants, and some antidepressants. Consult a comprehensive drug interaction resource for detailed information.

* **CYP450 Interactions:**  Limited data available.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C.  Use with caution only if clearly needed.
* **Breastfeeding:** Excretion in breast milk is unknown. Exercise caution.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

Refer to individual sections above.

## **Popular Combinations**

Papaverine is sometimes used in combination with phentolamine and alprostadil for intracavernosal injection in treating ED, although this is not an FDA-approved indication.


## **Precautions**

Use cautiously in patients with glaucoma, hepatic dysfunction, and cardiovascular disease.  Monitor liver function tests in patients receiving prolonged therapy.
