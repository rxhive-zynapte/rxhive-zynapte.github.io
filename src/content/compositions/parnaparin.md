## **Usage**

Parnaparin sodium, a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), encompassing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).  It is frequently used in surgical settings (general and orthopedic) and for patients at high risk of clot formation. Additionally, Parnaparin can be used in other scenarios such as during extracorporeal circulation procedures like hemodialysis.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Anticoagulant

- **Mechanism of Action:** Parnaparin primarily enhances the activity of antithrombin III, a natural anticoagulant in the body. This interaction predominantly inhibits factor Xa, and to a lesser extent, factor IIa (thrombin), thus disrupting the coagulation cascade and impeding clot formation and growth.

## **Alternate Names**

Parnaparin sodium is the common generic name. Some regional/international variations and brand names exist (e.g., Fluxum, Lowhepa, Minihepa).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Parnaparin's primary effect is anticoagulation, achieved through its potentiation of antithrombin III activity, resulting in factor Xa and, to a lesser degree, factor IIa inhibition.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Parnaparin is administered subcutaneously and has a rapid onset of action. It reaches peak plasma levels of anti-Xa activity in about 3 hours. Its plasma half-life is around 6 hours, although the anti-Xa activity can persist up to 20 hours after a single dose. The drug is mainly distributed in the blood and metabolized by both renal and hepatic pathways, eventually being excreted in the urine.

- **Mode of Action:** Parnaparin catalyzes the inactivation of factor Xa by antithrombin III, thereby reducing thrombin generation and limiting the formation and growth of blood clots.

- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Parnaparin primarily targets the coagulation cascade through antithrombin III-mediated factor Xa inhibition. There is limited evidence for direct receptor binding, enzyme inhibition beyond factors Xa/IIa, or neurotransmitter modulation.

- **Elimination pathways:** Both renal and hepatic routes, with final excretion predominantly via urine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Prophylaxis of DVT in General Surgery:** 3200 IU subcutaneously 2 hours before the procedure, followed by 3200 IU once daily for 7 days or until fully ambulant.
- **Prophylaxis of DVT in Higher Risk Surgery/Orthopedic Patients:** 4250 IU subcutaneously 12 hours before the procedure, followed by 4250 IU 12 hours post-op, then once daily for 10 days.
- **Treatment of Thromboembolic Disorders:** 6400 IU subcutaneously once daily for 7-10 days.

#### **Children:**

Limited data available for pediatric dosing; consult specialist guidelines.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary; consider renal function and bleeding risk.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; monitor closely. Dose adjustment may be necessary based on the severity of renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution advised; monitor for adverse effects. Dose adjustment may be warranted in severe cases.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider potential drug interactions and bleeding risk factors.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations:**  Dosage recommendations vary based on specific clinical indications and patient factors. Refer to clinical guidelines and consult specialists. 

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Consider patient-specific factors (age, weight, renal/hepatic function, concomitant medications, bleeding risk) for dose adjustments.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Bleeding (e.g., bruising, nosebleeds, prolonged bleeding from cuts)
- Hematoma at the injection site
- Pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Thrombocytopenia (including heparin-induced thrombocytopenia â€“ HIT)
- Severe bleeding (e.g., gastrointestinal or intracranial hemorrhage)
- Allergic reactions (skin rash, itching, hives, anaphylaxis)


### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Osteoporosis with prolonged high-dose therapy.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)
- Severe bleeding episodes
- Anaphylaxis


## **Contraindications**

- Active major bleeding
- History of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)
- Severe uncontrolled hypertension
- Recent hemorrhagic stroke
- Bacterial endocarditis
- Conditions with increased risk of hemorrhage


## **Drug Interactions**

- **Anticoagulants (warfarin, DOACs):** Increased bleeding risk.
- **Antiplatelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel):** Increased bleeding risk.
- **NSAIDs:** Increased bleeding risk.
- **Medications affecting CYP450 enzymes:** Potential alterations in Parnaparin metabolism.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Parnaparin does not cross the placenta; consider risks versus benefits. Data suggests LMWHs like Parnaparin are generally safe during pregnancy.
- **Breastfeeding:** Parnaparin is not secreted in breast milk in clinically significant amounts and is considered compatible with breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Enhances antithrombin III activity, inhibiting factor Xa and IIa.
- **Side Effects:** Bleeding, hematoma, injection site reactions, thrombocytopenia, allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Active bleeding, HIT history, severe hypertension, hemorrhagic stroke, increased bleeding risk conditions.
- **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, NSAIDs, CYP450 interacting drugs.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe; consult specialist.
- **Dosage:** See Dosage section above.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Platelet count, signs of bleeding, coagulation parameters if clinically indicated (especially in high risk patients).

## **Popular Combinations**

Data on specific popular combinations is limited. Use of Parnaparin with other anticoagulants is generally avoided due to increased bleeding risk.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Monitor for signs of bleeding, assess renal/hepatic function, consider patient-specific risk factors.
- **Specific Populations:** Pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers - consult specialist.
- **Children & Elderly:** Caution advised.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Limit alcohol intake, monitor interactions with diet/supplements.
