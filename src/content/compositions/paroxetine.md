## **Usage**

Paroxetine is primarily prescribed for the treatment of various mental health conditions, including:

*   Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
*   Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
*   Panic Disorder (with or without agoraphobia)
*   Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)
*   Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)
*   Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
*   Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)
*   Hot flashes associated with menopause (at a lower dose)

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI)

**Mechanism of Action:** Paroxetine selectively inhibits the reuptake of serotonin in the synaptic cleft, increasing the extracellular concentration of serotonin and enhancing serotonergic neurotransmission.

## **Alternate Names**

International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Paroxetine

**Brand Names:** Paxil, Brisdelle, Paxil CR, Pexeva, Aropax, Apo-Paroxetine, APX-Paroxetine.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Paroxetine exerts its therapeutic effects by enhancing serotonergic neurotransmission, which is believed to be dysregulated in the aforementioned mental health conditions.  The increased serotonin availability in the synapse leads to improved mood, reduced anxiety, and other beneficial effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Paroxetine is well-absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations reached within approximately 5-8 hours for immediate-release formulations and 3-11 hours for controlled-release formulations. Food does not significantly affect absorption.
*   **Metabolism:** Paroxetine is extensively metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP2D6, with minor contributions from other CYP enzymes.  Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6 can influence paroxetine metabolism and may lead to variations in plasma concentrations.
*   **Elimination:** Paroxetine is eliminated primarily through hepatic metabolism and subsequent renal excretion of metabolites. The elimination half-life is approximately 21 hours for immediate-release formulations and 25 hours for controlled-release formulations.

**Mode of Action:** Paroxetine binds to the serotonin transporter (SERT) on presynaptic neurons, blocking the reuptake of serotonin from the synaptic cleft.  This leads to increased serotonin concentrations in the synapse, promoting postsynaptic receptor activation.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Paroxetine's primary mechanism involves selective serotonin reuptake inhibition.

**Elimination Pathways:** Paroxetine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 in the liver, with metabolites excreted renally.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   The initial dose typically ranges from 10 mg to 20 mg once daily, usually taken in the morning.
*   Dosages can be gradually increased, if needed, by 10 mg increments at weekly intervals, depending on individual response and tolerability.
*   Maximum doses vary based on the condition being treated but typically do not exceed 50-60 mg per day for immediate-release formulations and 75 mg per day for controlled-release formulations.

#### **Children:**

Paroxetine is generally not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age for most indications due to concerns about efficacy and potential risks. However, in some specific cases, a doctor may decide that paroxetine is the best medication to treat a child's condition after a careful evaluation of the risks and benefits.  Dosages in children and adolescents should be determined by a physician and closely monitored.


#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:**  Initial dose is typically lower, starting at 10 mg daily and increasing gradually, if necessary. The maximum recommended dose is typically 40 mg per day.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Initial dose is usually lower, starting at 10 mg daily.  Dose adjustments should be made with caution, and the maximum dose may need to be reduced.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Initial dose is usually lower, starting at 10 mg daily.  Dose adjustments should be made with caution, and the maximum dose may need to be reduced.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with certain comorbid conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or other mental health disorders.  Careful monitoring and individualization of therapy are crucial.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Paroxetine is not typically used in the clinical settings of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on various factors, including patient age, renal or hepatic function, concomitant medications, and individual response to treatment.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, headache, dizziness, insomnia, drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, sweating, sexual dysfunction (decreased libido, delayed ejaculation, anorgasmia).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Serotonin syndrome (high fever, confusion, muscle rigidity, seizures), suicidal thoughts or behavior (especially in young adults), mania or hypomania, abnormal bleeding, hyponatremia (low sodium levels), angle-closure glaucoma, allergic reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Potential long-term effects of paroxetine use can include sexual dysfunction, weight gain, and withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Clinically significant ADRs that necessitate immediate intervention include serotonin syndrome, severe allergic reactions, suicidal ideation or behavior, and mania/hypomania.



## **Contraindications**

*   Concomitant use with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) is contraindicated due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.
*   Use with pimozide is contraindicated due to the potential for increased pimozide plasma concentrations.
*   Hypersensitivity to paroxetine or any of its components.

## **Drug Interactions**

Paroxetine can interact with various medications, including:

*   MAOIs: Concomitant use is contraindicated due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.
*   Other serotonergic drugs (e.g., triptans, SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs): Increased risk of serotonin syndrome.
*   CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, quinidine): Can increase paroxetine plasma concentrations.
*   CYP2D6 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin): Can decrease paroxetine plasma concentrations.
*   Warfarin and other anticoagulants: Increased risk of bleeding.
*   Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs): Paroxetine can inhibit TCA metabolism.
*   Tamoxifen: Paroxetine can reduce the effectiveness of tamoxifen.
*   Alcohol: While not strictly contraindicated, alcohol use is generally not recommended during paroxetine treatment.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

*   **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Paroxetine is generally considered a Category C or D medication during pregnancy, indicating a potential risk to the fetus.
*   **Fetal Risks:** Some studies have suggested a possible association between paroxetine use during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester, and certain birth defects, such as cardiac malformations.
*   **Breastfeeding:**  Paroxetine is excreted in breast milk, but the levels are generally low. Most authorities consider paroxetine to be one of the preferred antidepressants during breastfeeding, but infants should be monitored for potential side effects, such as irritability, poor feeding, and weight gain issues.
