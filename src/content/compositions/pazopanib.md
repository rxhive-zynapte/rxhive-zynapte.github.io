## **Usage**

- Pazopanib is prescribed for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS) in patients who have received prior chemotherapy.  Its efficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with adipocytic soft tissue sarcoma or gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Pazopanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). More specifically, it is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Pazopanib inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR)-1, -2, and -3, platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR)-α and -β, and c-kit, thereby blocking tumor growth and progression by inhibiting angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Pazopanib
- **Brand Name:** Votrient

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Pazopanib exerts its anti-cancer effects by primarily inhibiting multiple tyrosine kinases involved in angiogenesis and tumor growth. This leads to a reduction in tumor vascularization and a decrease in tumor cell proliferation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Pazopanib is administered orally and exhibits variable absorption, influenced by food intake.  It is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4, with minor contributions from CYP1A2 and CYP2C8.  Elimination occurs mainly through feces, with a small portion excreted in urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 31 hours, suggesting potential drug accumulation.
- **Mode of Action:** Pazopanib competitively binds to the ATP-binding pockets of target tyrosine kinases, preventing phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways involved in angiogenesis, cell growth, and proliferation.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**  Pazopanib inhibits VEGFR-1, -2, -3, PDGFR-α, PDGFR-β, and c-kit. It also inhibits FGFR-1 and -3, and KIT.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Pazopanib is mainly eliminated through hepatic metabolism (primarily via CYP3A4) and biliary/fecal excretion, with minimal renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The recommended dose is 800 mg orally once daily, taken without food (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal). The tablets should be swallowed whole and not crushed or broken.
- The maximum dose is 800 mg daily.

#### **Children:**

- Pazopanib is not recommended for children younger than 2 years old due to potential effects on organ development and maturation.  For older children, the dosage must be determined by a physician and will be based on the patient's body surface area and other factors. Safety and efficacy have not been fully established in pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustment is recommended for elderly patients, but they should be closely monitored for adverse effects.  A meta-analysis suggests patients over 60 years of age may be at higher risk for elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT).
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with creatinine clearance above 30 mL/min. Caution is advised for patients with creatinine clearance below 30 mL/min due to limited experience in this population.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  For patients with mild hepatic impairment (normal bilirubin and elevated ALT, or bilirubin up to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] irrespective of ALT), the recommended dose is 800 mg once daily.  For moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin >1.5 to 3 x ULN irrespective of ALT), the recommended dose is reduced to 200 mg once daily. Pazopanib is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin >3 x ULN irrespective of ALT).
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Close monitoring and dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, hypertension, QT prolongation, hypothyroidism, liver disease, bleeding disorders, or gastrointestinal conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Pazopanib's use is specifically indicated for advanced RCC and certain types of advanced STS. It is not indicated for use in the clinical scenarios listed (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations).

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose reductions (in 200 mg decrements) may be necessary based on individual tolerability and the management of adverse reactions.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, changes in hair color, hair loss, fatigue, weakness, high blood pressure, skin rash, dry skin, itching.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Hepatotoxicity (liver damage), including liver failure, QT prolongation, Torsades de pointes, severe bleeding, heart problems (including decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, myocardial ischemia, and cardiac failure),  tumor lysis syndrome,  pneumothorax, gastrointestinal perforation, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Chronic complications can include persistent hypertension,  hypothyroidism,  cardiac dysfunction,  renal impairment,  and secondary malignancies.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Hepatotoxicity, QT prolongation/Torsades de pointes, severe bleeding, heart failure,  tumor lysis syndrome,  RPLS,  angioedema,  anaphylaxis.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to pazopanib or any component of the formulation.
- Severe hepatic impairment.
- Coadministration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin) without dose adjustment.
- Coadministration with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine) or P-glycoprotein inhibitors.

## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP450 Interactions:** Pazopanib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, and coadministration with CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers can significantly alter its plasma concentration.
- **Other Interactions:** Pazopanib can interact with numerous medications, including:
    - Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, ritonavir): Increase pazopanib levels.
    - Strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin): Decrease pazopanib levels.
    - P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitors: Increase pazopanib levels.
    - Drugs that prolong the QT interval (e.g., amiodarone, quinidine): Increase the risk of Torsades de pointes.
    - Gastric acid-reducing agents (e.g., proton pump inhibitors, H2 blockers): Decrease pazopanib absorption.
    - Simvastatin: Increases the risk of liver enzyme elevations.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  D (Australia); Not assigned (US FDA)
- Pazopanib can cause fetal harm. Animal studies showed teratogenicity and embryolethality at clinically relevant doses. It is contraindicated during pregnancy unless the benefits outweigh the risks. Effective contraception should be used during treatment and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Pazopanib may be excreted in breast milk and can potentially cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants. Breastfeeding is contraindicated during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose.

## **Drug Profile Summary**
