## **Usage**

Pefloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic belonging to the fluoroquinolone class. It is prescribed for various bacterial infections, including:

*   Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs), such as cystitis and urethritis
*   Respiratory Tract Infections (RTIs)
*   Gastrointestinal Infections
*   Skin and Soft Tissue Infections
*   Bone and Joint Infections
*   Septicemia
*   Prostatitis
*   Bacterial Endocarditis
*   Neuromeningeal Infections

**Pharmacological Classification:** Fluoroquinolone Antibiotic

**Mechanism of Action:** Pefloxacin inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication, repair, and recombination. This inhibition leads to bacterial cell death.


## **Alternate Names** 

Pefloxacin is the generic name.  Brand names can vary regionally; Peflotab and Floxal are mentioned in the provided sources.



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Pefloxacin exhibits bactericidal activity by disrupting bacterial DNA replication. This action is concentration-dependent.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Pefloxacin is well-absorbed orally, with bioavailability close to 100%.  Food intake can enhance absorption.
*   **Distribution:** Pefloxacin achieves high tissue concentrations, surpassing serum levels.
*   **Metabolism:** Primarily hepatic, with N-oxide and norfloxacin as metabolites.
*   **Elimination:** Mainly renal excretion; some biliary elimination occurs.  Elimination half-life is approximately 6-12 hours, potentially necessitating dose adjustments in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

**Mode of Action:**  Pefloxacin targets bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. By binding to these enzymes, pefloxacin prevents the supercoiling and decatenation of DNA, vital processes for bacterial DNA replication, repair, and recombination.  The dual targeting of both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV minimizes the emergence of bacterial resistance.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Oral: 400 mg twice daily for 7-10 days for most infections. A single dose of 800 mg may be used for uncomplicated gonorrhea or cystitis in women under 65. Intravenous: 400 mg every 12 hours.

#### **Children:**

Not recommended for children under 12 years old. Some sources suggest 15-20 mg/kg/day divided twice daily for children older than 12, however caution is warranted given the potential for cartilage erosion.


#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary due to altered pharmacokinetics.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage reduction may be required.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustment is essential.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution should be exercised in patients with pre-existing CNS disorders, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical scenarios, such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations, are not readily available. Standard dosing guidelines should be considered, with adjustments based on patient-specific factors and the severity of infection.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are necessary based on renal/hepatic function, age, and comorbid conditions.



## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
*   Headache, dizziness, insomnia
*   Skin rash, itching, photosensitivity

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Tendonitis, tendon rupture
*   Peripheral neuropathy
*   QT prolongation, ventricular arrhythmias
*   Seizures (especially in patients with pre-existing CNS disorders)
*   Hepatic dysfunction
*   Hypersensitivity reactions (including swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat; hives; difficulty breathing)


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic complications from prolonged use are rare but can include peripheral neuropathy and tendon damage.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Clinically significant ADRs requiring immediate intervention include severe hypersensitivity reactions, seizures, tendon rupture, and QT prolongation.



## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to pefloxacin or other quinolones
*   Children under 12 years old
*   Pregnancy and breastfeeding
*   Concomitant use with tizanidine
*   History of tendon disorders related to fluoroquinolone use


## **Drug Interactions**

*   **Antacids (aluminum/magnesium hydroxide, sucralfate):** Decreased absorption of pefloxacin. Administer at least 2 hours apart.
*   **Iron/Zinc salts:** Reduced pefloxacin absorption.
*   **NSAIDs:** Increased risk of seizures.
*   **Anticoagulants (warfarin):** Increased risk of bleeding. Monitor INR closely.
*   **Theophylline:** Increased theophylline levels and risk of toxicity. Monitor theophylline levels.
*   **Antidiabetic medications (sulfonylureas, metformin):** Potential for hypoglycemia. Monitor blood glucose levels.
*   **CYP1A2 inhibitors (cimetidine):** May increase pefloxacin levels.
*   **CYP1A2 inducers (rifampicin):** May decrease pefloxacin levels.
*   **Dairy products:** May reduce pefloxacin absorption.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pefloxacin is contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential fetal risks and neonatal side effects. The drug can cross the placenta and is excreted in breast milk.
