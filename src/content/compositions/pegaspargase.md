## **Usage**

Pegaspargase is prescribed for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a type of blood cancer affecting white blood cells. It is particularly useful in patients who have experienced hypersensitivity reactions to other L-asparaginase treatments.  It's pharmacological classification is antineoplastic (anticancer) agent specifically an enzyme. It works by breaking down asparagine, an amino acid crucial for cell survival.  Since leukemic cells cannot produce their own asparagine (unlike healthy cells), this depletion leads to their death.

## **Alternate Names**

The international nonproprietary name (INN) for pegaspargase is pegaspargase. A common brand name under which it is marketed is Oncaspar.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Pegaspargase is a PEGylated form of L-asparaginase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes asparagine into aspartic acid and ammonia. This depletes asparagine levels in the blood, depriving leukemic cells (which cannot synthesize asparagine) of this essential amino acid, leading to their death. Healthy cells, capable of producing asparagine, are less affected.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Pegaspargase is administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). PEGylation extends its half-life, allowing for less frequent dosing. The drug is systemically degraded, likely by the reticuloendothelial system, with proteolytic enzymes contributing to its metabolism. It is not renally excreted due to its high molecular weight.

**Mode of Action:** Pegaspargase exerts its effect by enzyme activity.  It catalyzes the hydrolysis of asparagine, a process crucial for leukemic cell survival.  This targeted mechanism of action exploits the inability of leukemic cells to synthesize their own asparagine. There is no direct receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation involved in its primary mechanism.

**Elimination:** Pegaspargase is primarily eliminated through systemic degradation, likely by the reticuloendothelial system, rather than renal or hepatic excretion. Its terminal half-life is approximately 5.3 days for IV administration and 5.8 days for IM injection.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (over 21 years):**

* 2,000 U/m² IV or IM, every 14 days. Some protocols may utilize lower doses (e.g., 1,000-2,000 U/m²) or cap the dose at 3,750 U (1 vial) to reduce toxicity.

#### **Children (up to and including 21 years) & Adolescents:**

* **BSA ≥ 0.6 m²:** 2,500 U/m² IV or IM, every 14 days.
* **BSA < 0.6 m²:** 82.5 U/kg body weight IV or IM, every 14 days.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Limited data are available for patients over 65. No specific dosage adjustments are outlined but proceed cautiously considering potential age-related physiological changes.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is required, as pegaspargase is not renally excreted.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustment. Close monitoring is recommended due to a higher risk of hepatotoxicity.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with pre-existing conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hepatic impairment, or a history of thrombosis or pancreatitis, as pegaspargase can exacerbate these conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Pegaspargase dosing in these settings generally follows the standard dosage recommendations according to age and BSA, as described above.  However, adjustments may be necessary based on the patient's specific situation and the chemotherapy protocol being used.  Clinical cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and other emergency situations may require careful consideration and individualization of the pegaspargase dosage based on patient factors and concomitant medications.  Serum asparaginase activity monitoring is essential to ensure therapeutic levels are reached.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on adverse events. Refer to Table 1 within source material for dosage modifications relating to Infusion Reaction/Hypersensitivity Reaction and Thrombosis.

* History of pancreatitis related to prior L-asparaginase therapy
* History of serious hemorrhagic events with prior L-asparaginase therapy

## **Drug Interactions**

Pegaspargase can interact with various medications, including:

* **Methotrexate:**  Prior administration can increase pegaspargase's effects synergistically; subsequent administration can antagonize its effects.
* **Vincristine and Prednisone:** May be used in combination with pegaspargase but careful monitoring is necessary.
* **Other chemotherapy drugs:** Interactions may occur due to pegaspargase's impact on hepatic function and protein synthesis.
* **Anticoagulants:** Increased risk of bleeding or thrombosis when used concurrently.
* **Oral contraceptives:** Efficacy may be reduced; non-hormonal contraception is recommended.

See source material for a more exhaustive list of drug interactions.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pegaspargase is contraindicated during pregnancy due to potential fetal harm. Non-hormonal contraception must be used during treatment and for at least 6 months after discontinuation.

Breastfeeding is contraindicated during treatment and until after pegaspargase discontinuation, as it is unknown if the drug is excreted in breast milk.
