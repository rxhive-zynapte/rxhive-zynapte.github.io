## **Usage**

Pegfilgrastim is prescribed to decrease the incidence of infection, as manifested by febrile neutropenia, in patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anticancer drugs associated with a clinically significant incidence of febrile neutropenia. It is also indicated to increase survival in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation (hematopoietic subsyndrome of acute radiation syndrome).  It belongs to the pharmacological classification of colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), specifically, it is a long-acting recombinant form of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Pegfilgrastim stimulates the bone marrow to produce more neutrophils, a type of white blood cell crucial for fighting infections.

## **Alternate Names**

Pegfilgrastim is also known as pegylated recombinant human G-CSF. Brand names include Neulasta, Neulasta Onpro, Fulphila, Fylnetra, Nyvepria, Stimufend, Udenyca, and Ziextenzo.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Pegfilgrastim binds to specific cell surface receptors on hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow, stimulating their proliferation and differentiation into mature neutrophils. This leads to an increase in the number of circulating neutrophils, thus reducing the risk of infection.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Pegfilgrastim is administered subcutaneously. The pegylation (addition of polyethylene glycol) prolongs its half-life, allowing for once-per-chemotherapy-cycle dosing. It is primarily eliminated through neutrophil-mediated clearance, a self-regulating mechanism.  As neutrophil counts rise, the clearance of pegfilgrastim increases, resulting in a rapid decline in serum concentrations. Metabolism and hepatic excretion are negligible.  The pharmacokinetics in elderly patients is similar to that in adults.  In pediatric patients, younger age groups may have higher exposure (AUC). Renal impairment does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of pegfilgrastim.

**Mode of Action:** Pegfilgrastim, like filgrastim, acts by binding to the G-CSF receptor, a transmembrane protein expressed on myeloid progenitor cells. Receptor binding triggers intracellular signaling pathways that promote neutrophil production.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily eliminated by neutrophil-mediated clearance, which increases with higher neutrophil counts.  Metabolism and hepatic excretion are minimal.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 6 mg subcutaneously once per chemotherapy cycle, approximately 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy administration.

#### **Children:** Dosing is weight-based:

* **< 10 kg:**  0.1 mg/kg subcutaneously once per chemotherapy cycle.
* **10-20 kg:** 1.5 mg or 2 mg subcutaneously once per chemotherapy cycle.
* **21-30 kg:** 2.5 mg subcutaneously once per chemotherapy cycle.
* **31-44 kg:** 4 mg subcutaneously once per chemotherapy cycle.
* **> 45 kg:** 6 mg subcutaneously once per chemotherapy cycle.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is generally necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is expected.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor for adverse effects, particularly in patients with sickle cell disorders or pre-existing lung conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Pegfilgrastim's dosage remains consistent across various clinical settings involving myelosuppressive chemotherapy or radiation exposure.  Specific scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations do not necessitate dosage adjustments beyond the standard recommendations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

No routine dose adjustments are recommended based on renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Bone pain (most common), pain in arms or legs, back pain.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Spleen rupture (characterized by left upper abdominal pain or left shoulder pain), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), aortitis, alveolar hemorrhage, capillary leak syndrome, Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic complications from prolonged use are not well established.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Spleen rupture, ARDS, serious allergic reactions, aortitis, alveolar hemorrhage, capillary leak syndrome, Sweet's syndrome.




## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to pegfilgrastim or filgrastim. Caution in patients with sickle cell disorders, history of pulmonary issues, or pre-malignant myeloid conditions.

## **Drug Interactions**

No specific drug interactions have been definitively identified.  However, as it is primarily cleared by neutrophils, any drugs affecting neutrophil function could theoretically interact with pegfilgrastim. Administering pegfilgrastim 14 days before or 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy is advised.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category:  Not assigned by the US FDA. Australian TGA category B3. Limited human data are available. Animal studies suggest potential for embryolethality and pregnancy loss at high doses.  Not recommended during pregnancy or in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.

It is unknown if pegfilgrastim is excreted in breast milk.  Due to the potential for neonatal exposure, it is generally recommended to discontinue breastfeeding or the drug, considering the importance of the drug to the mother.
