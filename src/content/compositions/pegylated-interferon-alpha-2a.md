      Can it cure hepatitis C?**


      **A:** Pegylated interferon alpha 2A, typically in combination with
      ribavirin, can achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), which is
      considered a functional cure for hepatitis C in many patients.  Newer
      direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are now preferred due to their superior
      efficacy and tolerability.  However, in some cases, Peg-IFN-α2a may still
      be used, especially if DAAs are contraindicated or unaffordable.

## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2A is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in patients with compensated liver disease (both HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative) exhibiting evidence of viral replication and liver inflammation. It's also used for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in patients with compensated liver disease (with or without cirrhosis), often in combination with ribavirin.  Additionally, it is used in the treatment of certain blood cancers like essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera and myelofibrosis.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Immunomodulatory agent, antiviral agent, antineoplastic agent.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2A enhances the body's immune response against viral infections and some cancers.  It does this by binding to specific cell surface receptors, which activates intracellular signaling pathways. This leads to the increased production of antiviral and immunomodulatory proteins, enhancing both innate and adaptive immune responses. It helps your immune system fight hepatitis infections and can inhibit the growth of certain cancer cells.


## **Alternate Names**

- Peginterferon alfa-2a
- PEG-INF-alfa-2a


- **Brand Names:** Pegasys


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2A binds to type I interferon receptors, triggering the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. This leads to the production of various proteins that have antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory effects. It increases the activity of natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes and upregulates major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Administered subcutaneously, it reaches peak plasma concentration in 72-96 hours. Steady-state is achieved by weeks 5-8.
    - **Metabolism:** It inhibits the CYP1A2 enzyme, potentially affecting the metabolism of other drugs.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through renal clearance, with a half-life of approximately 160 hours.


- **Mode of Action:** Binds to type I interferon receptors, initiating the JAK-STAT pathway. This leads to gene transcription, producing antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory proteins. It also activates natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

- **Receptor Binding:** Type I interferon receptors (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2).


- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Chronic Hepatitis B:** 180 mcg subcutaneously once weekly for 48 weeks.
- **Chronic Hepatitis C:** 180 mcg subcutaneously once weekly, in combination with ribavirin, for 24-48 weeks depending on genotype. Monotherapy may be considered in cases of ribavirin intolerance or contraindication.

#### **Children:**

- **Chronic Hepatitis B:**  Dosage based on body weight (generally not exceeding 180 mcg once weekly) and should be determined by the physician. Use in children younger than 3 years of age should be carefully considered.
- **Chronic Hepatitis C:** Dosage based on body weight (generally 180 mcg/1.73 m² once weekly, maximum 180mcg), administered with ribavirin,  for 24-48 weeks depending on the genotype. Use in children younger than 5 years of age should be carefully considered. Pediatric patients should maintain pediatric dosing through the completion of therapy.



#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Close monitoring is recommended due to increased risk of adverse effects. Dose adjustments may be necessary based on kidney function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction to 135 mcg/week for CrCl 30-50 mL/min, and 90mcg/week or less for CrCl <30 mL/min.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Close monitoring is crucial, especially in cirrhotic patients. Discontinue treatment immediately if hepatic decompensation occurs.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful assessment and monitoring are needed, especially for those with pre-existing psychiatric conditions, autoimmune diseases, or cytopenias.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Pegylated interferon alfa-2a is not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest). It is primarily utilized in the long-term treatment of chronic viral hepatitis and certain malignancies.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be required based on patient response and tolerance, as well as hematological and biochemical parameters (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes). Dose reductions are also necessary for patients with renal impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
- Flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, headache, fatigue, muscle aches)
- Injection site reactions (redness, pain, swelling)
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite

- Mood changes, irritability, depression
- Hair loss



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
- Severe depression, suicidal ideation
- Blood disorders (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia)
- Autoimmune disorders
- Liver damage
- Pancreatitis
- Heart problems (e.g. cardiomyopathy)
- Thyroid dysfunction
- Infections
- Severe skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome)
- Seizures
- Stroke
- Vision changes




### **Long-Term Effects:**
- Chronic fatigue
- Thyroid problems
- Psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety)
- Dental and gum problems

## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP1A2 substrates:** Pegylated interferon alpha 2a is a CYP1A2 inhibitor and may increase levels of drugs metabolized by CYP1A2. Dosage adjustments of such drugs may be necessary.
- **Ribavirin:** Additive hematological toxicity.
- **Theophylline:** Increased theophylline levels due to CYP1A2 inhibition.
- **Drugs that prolong QT interval:** Increased risk of QT prolongation.
- **Immunosuppressants:** Reduced efficacy of pegylated interferon alpha 2a.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (monotherapy), X (with ribavirin). Ribavirin is strictly contraindicated during pregnancy and in male partners of pregnant women.  Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2A monotherapy should only be used if the benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.

- **Breastfeeding:**  Data regarding drug excretion in breast milk are limited, and it is unknown whether interferon alpha-2a can cause fetal harm if administered to pregnant woman, or affect reproduction capacity. While there is minimal risk of neonatal harm, a decision should be made to discontinue either breastfeeding or the drug, weighing the importance of the drug to the mother.
