## **Usage**

Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2B is prescribed for:

- Chronic hepatitis C infection (in combination with ribavirin and/or other direct-acting antivirals).
- Adjuvant treatment of melanoma with microscopic or gross nodal involvement within 84 days of surgical resection (Sylatron).

**Pharmacological Classification:** Immunomodulator, antiviral.

**Mechanism of Action:** Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2B binds to specific cell surface receptors, activating intracellular signaling pathways (primarily the JAK-STAT pathway) that lead to the production of antiviral proteins, enhancing the immune response against viral infections and exhibiting antineoplastic activity.

## **Alternate Names**

- Peginterferon alfa-2b
- PEG-Intron
- Sylatron (for melanoma)

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2B exerts its therapeutic effects by modulating the immune system and inhibiting viral replication. It increases the activity of natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which target and destroy infected cells.  Additionally, it inhibits viral protein synthesis and assembly, reducing viral load.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

- **Absorption:** Well absorbed after subcutaneous injection. Pegylation prolongs its half-life, allowing for once-weekly administration.
- **Metabolism:** Primarily hepatic.  The pegylation process may alter metabolic pathways.
- **Elimination:** Renal excretion is the main route of elimination.

**Mode of Action:** Binds to type I interferon receptors, activating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway.  This pathway induces the expression of numerous interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) with antiviral, immunomodulatory, and antiproliferative effects.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Hepatitis C:** 1.5 mcg/kg subcutaneously once weekly in combination with other antiviral agents.  Dose adjustments may be necessary depending on HCV genotype, treatment history, and tolerability.
* **Melanoma:** 6 mcg/kg subcutaneously once weekly for 8 doses, followed by 3 mcg/kg subcutaneously once weekly for up to 5 years.

#### **Children (3 years and older):**

* **Hepatitis C:** 60 mcg/mÂ² subcutaneously once weekly in combination with ribavirin. Dose adjustments may be needed based on individual response and tolerance.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose reduction might be required due to potential age-related decline in renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary in moderate to severe renal impairment.  Close monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in patients with decompensated liver disease.  Caution is advised in patients with compensated liver disease.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring and dose adjustments may be required in patients with pre-existing psychiatric conditions, autoimmune diseases, or cardiovascular disease.
