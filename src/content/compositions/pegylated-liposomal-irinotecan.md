## **Usage**

Pegylated liposomal irinotecan, in combination with fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV), is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas after disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy. It has also been recently approved, in combination with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (NALIRIFOX), for the first-line treatment of adults with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  It is not indicated as a single agent.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antineoplastic agent, topoisomerase I inhibitor.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Pegylated liposomal irinotecan is a liposomal formulation of irinotecan, which itself is a prodrug. The liposomal encapsulation allows for enhanced delivery and accumulation of irinotecan within the tumor. Inside the tumor cells, irinotecan is converted to SN-38, its active metabolite. SN-38 inhibits topoisomerase I, an enzyme essential for DNA replication and repair. This inhibition leads to DNA damage, ultimately causing cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

- Liposomal irinotecan
- nal-IRI
- MM-398
- PEP02

- **Brand Names:** ONIVYDE®


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The primary effect of pegylated liposomal irinotecan is cytotoxicity against tumor cells due to topoisomerase I inhibition by SN-38.  The liposomal encapsulation enhances drug delivery to the tumor site due to factors like enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and uptake by tumor-associated macrophages.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** The pegylated liposomal formulation alters the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan. This formulation results in prolonged circulation time, increased tumor uptake, and reduced plasma clearance compared to conventional irinotecan. Irinotecan is metabolized in the liver to SN-38, its active metabolite. SN-38 subsequently undergoes glucuronidation by UGT1A1 enzymes.

- **Mode of Action:** Irinotecan is converted to SN-38, which forms a ternary complex with topoisomerase I and DNA. This complex leads to DNA single-strand breaks. During replication, these breaks become double-strand breaks, which ultimately trigger cell death.

- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** SN-38 inhibits topoisomerase I.

- **Elimination Pathways:**  Irinotecan and SN-38 are primarily eliminated through biliary/fecal excretion and hepatic metabolism, with renal excretion playing a lesser role.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas, Second-Line):**

- 70 mg/m² intravenously over 90 minutes, followed by LV 400 mg/m² intravenously over 30 minutes, followed by 5-FU 2400 mg/m² intravenously over 46 hours, administered every 2 weeks.
- Patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele: Initial dose of 50 mg/m² every 2 weeks, with escalation to 70 mg/m² as tolerated.

#### **Adults (Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma, First-Line):**

- 50 mg/m² intravenously over 90 minutes, followed by oxaliplatin 60 mg/m² intravenously over 120 minutes, followed by leucovorin 400 mg/m² intravenously over 30 minutes, followed by fluorouracil 2400 mg/m² intravenously over 46 hours, administered every 2 weeks (NALIRIFOX).

#### **Children:**  No established pediatric dosing.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments based on age, but close monitoring for adverse events is recommended.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment needed for mild to moderate impairment. Use with caution in severe renal impairment. Not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose recommendations for patients with bilirubin >ULN. Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with pre-existing lung disease. Close monitoring is recommended for patients with cardiovascular conditions or diabetes.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Pegylated liposomal irinotecan is specifically indicated for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, in combination with 5-FU/LV (second-line) or NALIRIFOX (first-line). It does not have specific dosages for other clinical use cases such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose reductions may be necessary based on toxicity. All dose modifications should be based on the worst preceding toxicity. (See Tables 3 and 4, Source [11]).



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, neutropenia, fatigue, asthenia, anemia, stomatitis, and pyrexia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Severe neutropenia (including febrile neutropenia and sepsis), severe diarrhea, interstitial lung disease, hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis), and embryo-fetal toxicity.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic complications from prolonged use are not fully characterized but may include secondary malignancies.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe neutropenia, severe diarrhea, interstitial lung disease, and hypersensitivity reactions require immediate intervention.
