## **Usage**

Pemetrexed is an antineoplastic agent, specifically an antifolate antimetabolite, prescribed for the treatment of:

* **Malignant pleural mesothelioma:**  A cancer affecting the lining of the lungs and chest wall. Pemetrexed is used in combination with cisplatin for patients who have not received prior chemotherapy.
* **Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC):**  Pemetrexed is used:
    * In combination with cisplatin for initial treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC.
    * As a single agent for the maintenance treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC in patients whose disease has not progressed after four cycles of platinum-based first-line chemotherapy.
    * As a single agent for the treatment of recurrent non-squamous NSCLC in patients who have received prior chemotherapy.

## **Alternate Names**

* **Generic Name:** Pemetrexed disodium
* **Brand Names:** Alimta, Axtle, Pemfexy, Pemrydi RTU


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Pemetrexed disrupts crucial cellular processes required for DNA and RNA synthesis, ultimately inhibiting tumor growth.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Administered intravenously, achieving peak plasma concentrations at the end of the infusion.
* **Distribution:**  Widely distributed throughout the body, including in pleural fluid (fluid surrounding the lungs).
* **Metabolism:**  Minimal hepatic metabolism. Primarily excreted unchanged renally.
* **Elimination:** Predominantly via renal excretion. Patients with impaired renal function require dose adjustment or may not be candidates for pemetrexed.

**Mode of Action:** Pemetrexed is a multi-targeted antifolate that inhibits several folate-dependent enzymes essential for purine and pyrimidine synthesis:

* **Thymidylate synthase (TS):**  Inhibits the formation of thymidine, a crucial DNA building block.
* **Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR):** Inhibition of DHFR further disrupts folate metabolism, contributing to the suppression of DNA synthesis.
* **Glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT):** Inhibition of GARFT interferes with purine synthesis.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily eliminated unchanged through renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **NSCLC (Initial treatment with cisplatin):** 500 mg/m² as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for up to six cycles.
* **NSCLC (Maintenance treatment):** 500 mg/m² as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.
* **NSCLC (Recurrent disease):** 500 mg/m² as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.
* **Malignant pleural mesothelioma:** 500 mg/m² as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle, administered with cisplatin.


#### **Children:**

The safety and efficacy of pemetrexed in children have not been established. No pediatric dosing recommendations are available.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustments are necessary based solely on age, but close monitoring for adverse effects is recommended.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Pemetrexed is contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 45 mL/min. Dose adjustment may be needed for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. No specific dose adjustments have been established.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Patients with pre-existing medical conditions should be monitored closely.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  

Pemetrexed is not indicated for use in intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, the intensive care unit (ICU), or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on hematologic toxicity, renal function, and other adverse effects. Consult the full prescribing information for detailed dosage modification tables.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen):**  Can increase pemetrexed exposure, particularly in patients with renal impairment. Concurrent use should be avoided or carefully monitored.
* **Other nephrotoxic drugs:**  Combined use can increase the risk of renal toxicity.
* **Drugs that affect bone marrow function:**  Can worsen myelosuppression.
* **Folic acid and vitamin B12:** Administering these reduces pemetrexed-related toxicity.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Pemetrexed can cause fetal harm. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after the last dose. Men should use contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose.
* **Breastfeeding:** Pemetrexed is contraindicated during breastfeeding.
