## **Usage**

Penicillamine is primarily prescribed for:

* **Wilson's Disease:** A genetic disorder causing copper accumulation in the body.
* **Cystinuria:**  A hereditary disorder characterized by excessive cystine in the urine, leading to kidney stones.
* **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** An autoimmune disease causing joint inflammation.
* **Heavy Metal Poisoning (e.g., lead, arsenic):** Penicillamine acts as a chelating agent, binding to heavy metals and facilitating their removal.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Chelating agent, disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD).

**Mechanism of Action:** Penicillamine works primarily by chelating copper, promoting its excretion in urine.  It also reduces cystine levels in urine, preventing stone formation. In rheumatoid arthritis, its mechanism isn't fully understood but might involve immunomodulatory effects.


## **Alternate Names**

* D-Penicillamine
* (2S)-2-amino-3-methyl-3-sulfanylbutanoic acid


**Brand Names:** Cuprimine, Depen, D-Penamine


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**

* **Wilson's Disease:** Binds and removes excess copper.
* **Cystinuria:**  Reduces cystine levels by forming a more soluble disulfide complex with cysteine.
* **Rheumatoid Arthritis:**  May affect collagen synthesis, decrease T-cell activity, and scavenge free radicals, reducing inflammation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Administered orally; absorption is variable and reduced by food.
* **Metabolism:**  Some hepatic metabolism occurs.
* **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion; dosage adjustments are necessary in renal impairment.

**Mode of Action:** Penicillamine's primary mode of action is through its copper and cystine chelating properties. It forms stable complexes with these substances, which are then readily excreted by the kidneys.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Not a primary mechanism of action for this drug.

**Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly renal excretion as penicillamine-metal complexes or penicillamine-cysteine disulfide.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Wilson's Disease:** 750-1500 mg/day in divided doses, taken on an empty stomach.
* **Cystinuria:** 1-4 g/day in divided doses, adjusted to maintain urinary cystine below 200 mg/L. 
* **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** Initial: 125-250 mg/day, gradually increased to 500-750 mg/day as tolerated. Maximum: 1500 mg/day.

#### **Children:**

* **Wilson's Disease:** 20 mg/kg/day divided BID or TID, taken 1 hour before meals.
* **Cystinuria:** 20-30 mg/kg/day divided BID or TID, taken 1 hour before meals.
* **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** 15-20 mg/kg/day, initial dose lower, gradually increased.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Start at a lower dose and titrate cautiously, monitoring for adverse effects. Dose reduction may be required due to age-related decline in renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dosage adjustment is essential, avoiding use if creatinine clearance is below 50 mL/min.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, but specific dosage adjustments are not well defined. Monitor liver function tests.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient characteristics and potential drug interactions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Penicillamine does not have a clinical indication for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage must be adjusted based on the indication, patient response, tolerance, renal function, and the presence of other medical conditions.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

* Anorexia
* Diarrhea
* Dysgeusia (altered taste)
* Nausea and vomiting
* Skin rash
* Proteinuria


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Aplastic anemia
* Agranulocytosis
* Thrombocytopenia
* Goodpasture's syndrome
* Pulmonary complications (e.g., pneumonitis, fibrosis)
* Hepatotoxicity
* Myasthenia gravis-like syndrome
* Nephrotic syndrome
* Optic neuritis


### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic complications can include kidney damage, bone marrow suppression, and skin changes (wrinkling, elastosis perforans serpiginosa).


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Serious ADRs include aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, Goodpasture's syndrome, and severe allergic reactions. These require prompt discontinuation of the drug and supportive management.


## **Contraindications**

* History of penicillamine-induced aplastic anemia or agranulocytosis.
* Penicillin allergy.
* Pregnancy (except for Wilson's disease or specific cases of cystinuria when the benefits outweigh the risks).
* Breastfeeding.
* Renal insufficiency and rheumatoid arthritis (combined).
* Concurrent use with gold therapy, antimalarial drugs, or immunosuppressants.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Digoxin:** Penicillamine may decrease digoxin levels.
* **Iron supplements:**  Reduce penicillamine absorption. Administer separately.
* **Antacids:** Reduce penicillamine absorption. Administer separately.
* **Gold salts, antimalarials, immunosuppressants:** Increased risk of serious hematologic and renal adverse reactions. Avoid concurrent use.
* **Drugs that suppress bone marrow function:** Increased risk of myelosuppression.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:** D (contraindicated except in specific cases).  Penicillamine is teratogenic and can cause connective tissue disorders in the fetus. 
* **Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated. Penicillamine is excreted in breast milk and can affect copper and zinc levels in infants.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Chelating agent, forming complexes with copper, cystine, and other heavy metals, facilitating their excretion. May have immunomodulatory effects in rheumatoid arthritis.
* **Side Effects:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysgeusia, skin rash, proteinuria; rarely, aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, Goodpasture's syndrome.
