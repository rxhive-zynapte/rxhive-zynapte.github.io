## **Usage**

Penicillin is prescribed for a wide range of bacterial infections. It belongs to the **beta-lactam antibiotics** class. Its mechanism of action involves inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to and inactivating penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This leads to cell lysis and bacterial death.  Penicillins are mainly effective against Gram-positive bacteria and some Gram-negative bacteria.


## **Alternate Names**

Penicillin G (benzathine, procaine, potassium, sodium)  
Penicillin V (phenoxymethylpenicillin)  
Penicillin VK (Penicillin V potassium)


**Brand Names:**  Pen Vee K, Veetids, Pfizerpen


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Penicillins exert their bactericidal effect by disrupting cell wall synthesis. They bind to PBPs, enzymes essential for cross-linking peptidoglycans, which are crucial components of bacterial cell walls. This binding inhibits PBPs, leading to a weakened cell wall and ultimately bacterial lysis.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Penicillin absorption varies depending on the specific form. Penicillin G is poorly absorbed orally, hence administered parenterally. Penicillin V exhibits better oral absorption.
*   **Distribution:** Penicillins distribute widely throughout the body, reaching therapeutic concentrations in various tissues and fluids.
*   **Metabolism:** Minimal metabolism occurs for most penicillins.
*   **Elimination:** Penicillins are primarily eliminated renally through glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with renal impairment.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Penicillin V: 250-500 mg orally every 6-8 hours.

Penicillin G:  Dosage depends on the route and specific infection, ranging from 600,000 units to several million units administered intramuscularly or intravenously.

#### **Children:**

Penicillin V:  Dosage is based on body weight, typically 25-50 mg/kg/day in divided doses.

Penicillin G: Dosage varies depending on the infection, with pediatric doses commonly ranging from 25,000 to 50,000 units/kg/day administered intramuscularly or intravenously. 

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary in the elderly due to age-related decline in renal function.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction and/or increased dosing intervals are necessary for patients with renal dysfunction.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustments are usually not required for patients with hepatic impairment. 
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Dose modifications may be needed based on coexisting medical conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases:**

Specific dosage adjustments are necessary based on clinical indications and patient factors. Consult infectious diseases specialists or pharmacists for optimal dosing guidelines in specialized clinical settings like intubation, surgical prophylaxis, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) care, and emergency situations. 

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Renal function should be closely monitored, and dose modifications are necessary according to creatinine clearance.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, rash, urticaria.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Anaphylaxis, serum sickness, interstitial nephritis, hemolytic anemia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, seizures (high doses).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term use of penicillin can lead to disruption of normal gut flora and an increased risk of opportunistic infections like *Clostridium difficile* infection.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Anaphylaxis, DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms), severe skin reactions.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to penicillin or any other beta-lactam antibiotics.



## **Drug Interactions**

Probenecid increases penicillin levels by inhibiting tubular secretion.
Tetracyclines can antagonize the effects of penicillin.
Methotrexate toxicity can be increased when combined with penicillin.
Oral contraceptives effectiveness may be reduced.
Other interacting drugs: warfarin, NSAIDs.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Penicillin is generally considered safe during pregnancy (Pregnancy Category B). It is excreted in breast milk in low concentrations and generally compatible with breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis.
*   **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, anaphylaxis (rare).
*   **Contraindications:** Penicillin hypersensitivity.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Probenecid, tetracyclines, methotrexate.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe.
*   **Dosage:** Varies depending on infection and patient factors.
*   **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, signs of hypersensitivity.

## **Popular Combinations**

Penicillin is sometimes combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor (e.g., clavulanate) to enhance activity against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.



## **Precautions**

*   Assess for penicillin allergy before administration.
*   Monitor renal function, especially in patients with pre-existing renal disease.
*   Careful use in patients with a history of gastrointestinal issues.
*   Observe for signs of hypersensitivity reactions.
