## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Pentazocine is prescribed for the relief of moderate to severe pain. It can also be used as an adjunct to anesthesia, for labor pain, and postoperatively.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Narcotic analgesic, opioid agonist-antagonist.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Pentazocine binds to opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), altering the perception of and response to pain. It acts as a partial agonist at the kappa opioid receptor and as a weak antagonist at the mu opioid receptor. This mixed action contributes to its analgesic effects while also limiting the potential for respiratory depression and dependence compared to pure mu agonists like morphine.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:** No widely recognized international or regional variations exist.
- **Brand Names:** Talwin, Talwin NX (combined with naloxone), Fortral, Sosegon.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Pentazocine primarily interacts with kappa opioid receptors, producing analgesia, sedation, and respiratory depression. Its weak mu antagonist activity can precipitate withdrawal symptoms in individuals physically dependent on mu agonists.  It also has some cardiovascular effects, including increased heart rate and blood pressure.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Pentazocine is well-absorbed following oral, intramuscular (IM), subcutaneous (SC), and intravenous (IV) administration. Oral bioavailability is reduced due to first-pass metabolism.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver via glucuronidation and oxidation, forming several metabolites.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted mainly in urine, with a small amount in feces. The elimination half-life is approximately 2-3 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Binds to kappa opioid receptors in the CNS, inhibiting pain signal transmission and modulating pain perception. Its weak mu antagonist activity counteracts some of the effects of mu agonists.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Kappa opioid receptor partial agonist, mu opioid receptor weak antagonist. No significant enzyme inhibition or direct neurotransmitter modulation reported.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of metabolites. Hepatic metabolism plays a significant role in its clearance.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Oral:** 50-100 mg every 3-4 hours as needed. Maximum daily dose: 600 mg.
- **Parenteral (IM, SC, IV):** 30 mg every 3-4 hours. IV doses should not exceed 30 mg, and IM/SC doses should not exceed 60 mg. Maximum daily dose: 360 mg.

#### **Children:**

- **Parenteral (IM):**  >1 year: 0.5 mg/kg.  Not recommended for children under 1 year.
- **Pediatric Safety:**  Use with caution in children. Monitor closely for respiratory depression.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and titrate slowly due to increased sensitivity and potential for age-related renal/hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be necessary depending on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Dose adjustment may be required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with respiratory disease, head injury, increased intracranial pressure, seizures, cardiovascular disease, or substance use disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases:**

- **Intubation:** Pentazocine can be used as an analgesic adjunct to facilitate intubation.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Can be used for pre- and postoperative pain management.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Use with extreme caution as it can cause respiratory depression. Close monitoring is essential.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  May be used for pain management in the ICU but with careful monitoring.
- **Emergency Situations:**  Can be used in certain emergency situations for pain relief but caution is necessary due to the potential for respiratory depression.


### **Dosage Adjustments:**  Dosage adjustments based on renal/hepatic function are recommended. For specific guidance consult the Drug Profile Summary below.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, lightheadedness, drowsiness, sweating, dry mouth, constipation, headache, euphoria.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Respiratory depression, seizures, allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), hallucinations, confusion, cardiovascular effects (increased heart rate, blood pressure), urinary retention.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Tolerance, dependence, opioid withdrawal syndrome upon abrupt discontinuation.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe respiratory depression, anaphylaxis, serotonin syndrome (when combined with serotonergic drugs), opioid withdrawal syndrome.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to pentazocine, severe respiratory depression, acute or severe asthma, increased intracranial pressure, head injury, paralytic ileus, concurrent use of MAO inhibitors.

## **Drug Interactions**

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (Consult specific guidelines/resources for the most up-to-date categorization).
- **Fetal Risks:** Prolonged use during pregnancy can lead to neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome.
- **Breastfeeding:** Pentazocine is excreted in breast milk. Monitor infants for sedation and respiratory depression. Consider the risks and benefits.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Kappa opioid receptor partial agonist, mu opioid receptor weak antagonist.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, respiratory depression, seizures.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, respiratory depression, increased intracranial pressure.
- **Drug Interactions:** Alcohol, CNS depressants, other opioids, MAOIs.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category C; excreted in breast milk.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 50-100mg orally q3-4h (max 600 mg/day), or 30mg IV/IM/SC q3-4h (max 360 mg/day); children: 0.5 mg/kg IM (single dose, for >1 year old).
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, heart rate, level of consciousness, pain scores.

## **Popular Combinations**

Pentazocine is sometimes combined with naloxone (Talwin NX) to reduce the risk of abuse when administered orally. However, naloxone does not affect the drug's action when taken orally as prescribed.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess for respiratory function, substance use disorders, allergies, and other medical conditions before administration.
- **Specific Populations:**  See "Dosage - Special Cases".
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants. Caution when driving or operating machinery.
