## **Usage**

Pentosan polysulfate sodium is prescribed for the treatment of bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (IC), characterized by moderate to severe pain, urgency, and frequency of micturition, particularly in patients with glomerulations or Hunner's lesions.  It is classified as a weak anticoagulant, fibrinolytic, and uroprotective agent.  It is thought to work by repairing the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) layer of the bladder urothelium, which is often deficient in patients with IC. This protective layer helps to prevent irritating substances in the urine from reaching the bladder wall, thus reducing inflammation and pain.

## **Alternate Names**

- Pentosan polysulfate
- PPS
- Elmiron (brand name)
- Comfora (brand name)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Pentosan polysulfate sodium exhibits multiple effects, including:

* **Uroprotective:**  Binds to the bladder wall mucosa and may act as a buffer to protect tissues from irritating substances in the urine.
* **Anticoagulant:** Inhibits activated factor X (FXa) and thrombin, reducing blood clotting.
* **Fibrinolytic:** Increases tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), promoting the breakdown of blood clots.
* **Anti-inflammatory:** May reduce inflammation within the bladder wall.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, with a bioavailability of approximately 6%.
* **Metabolism:** Partially desulfated in the liver and spleen, and partially depolymerized in the kidney.
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted in the feces (58-84% as unchanged drug) and to a lesser extent in the urine (6% mainly as metabolites). Elimination half-life is 20-27 hours.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

100 mg orally three times a day, taken with water at least 1 hour before meals or 2 hours after meals. Treatment response should be evaluated every 6 months. If no improvement is observed after 6 months, discontinue therapy.

#### **Children:**

Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 16 years of age. For adolescents 16 years and older, the adult dose may be used.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No dose adjustment is recommended, though caution should be exercised due to potential age-related decline in organ function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustments have been studied, so caution is advised. Monitor renal function closely.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution as hepatic impairment may impact the drug's pharmacokinetics. Monitor liver function tests.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with bleeding disorders, blood vessel disorders, eye disorders, or stomach/intestinal disorders.  Close monitoring is recommended.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Pentosan polysulfate sodium is specifically indicated for bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis and has not been established for use in other clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, bleeding disorders, or those taking concomitant medications that affect coagulation.  Close monitoring of these patients is essential.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

* Alopecia (hair loss)
* Diarrhea
* Nausea
* Headache
* Stomach upset
* Abdominal pain
* Dizziness

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Rectal bleeding
* Changes in vision (blurred vision, difficulty adjusting to low light, changes in color perception) â€“ may be indicative of pigmentary maculopathy
* Bleeding complications (easy bruising, nosebleeds, bleeding gums)
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, dizziness, trouble breathing)
* Liver function abnormalities
* Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)

### **Long-Term Effects**

* Pigmentary maculopathy (retinal changes) has been observed with prolonged use, which can lead to vision impairment and may be irreversible. Regular ophthalmological examinations are crucial during long-term therapy.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, significant bleeding, and signs of retinal changes require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to pentosan polysulfate sodium or any component of the formulation.
* Active bleeding


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, heparin, rivaroxaban):** Increased risk of bleeding.
* **Antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel, aspirin):** Increased risk of bleeding.
* **NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen):** Increased risk of bleeding.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  No adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Use only if clearly needed.
* **Breastfeeding:**  It is unknown if pentosan polysulfate sodium is excreted in human milk.  Use with caution and consider the potential risk to the newborn.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  GAG layer repair, FXa inhibition, tPA release.
* **Side Effects:** Alopecia, diarrhea, nausea, bleeding, retinal changes.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, active bleeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, NSAIDs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution.
* **Dosage:** 100 mg orally three times daily.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Liver function tests, complete blood count (CBC), ophthalmic examinations, bleeding signs.


## **Popular Combinations**

No specific drug combinations are routinely recommended for use with pentosan polysulfate sodium in the treatment of IC.

## **Precautions**

* Monitor for vision changes and bleeding.
* Caution in patients with bleeding disorders, liver or kidney disease, or those taking other anticoagulants/antiplatelet agents.
* Regular ophthalmic examinations are necessary for early detection of pigmentary maculopathy.
