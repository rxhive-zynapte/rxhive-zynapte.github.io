## **Usage**

- Pepsin is prescribed for digestive disorders, particularly those related to protein digestion. It is used as a digestive aid in conditions like indigestion, dyspepsia, and hypochlorhydria (low stomach acid). It can also be used in cases of pancreatic insufficiency.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Digestive enzyme.
- **Mechanism of action:** Pepsin is a proteolytic enzyme that breaks down proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids. It requires an acidic environment for optimal activity.

## **Alternate Names**

-  No commonly used alternate names.
- **Brand names:**  Bemosin,  Digestive Enzymes (often in combination with other enzymes).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Pepsin exerts its effects within the stomach lumen. In the presence of hydrochloric acid, pepsinogen (the inactive precursor) is converted to pepsin. Pepsin then hydrolyzes peptide bonds in proteins, facilitating their digestion and absorption in the small intestine. This leads to improved nutrient absorption and alleviation of indigestion symptoms.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Primarily active in the stomach lumen, minimal systemic absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Not applicable, as pepsin acts locally in the stomach.
    - **Elimination:**  Degraded in the small intestine and eliminated in the feces.
- **Mode of action:** Pepsin catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, specifically those involving aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine).
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Does not bind to receptors, inhibit enzymes other than its protein substrates, or modulate neurotransmitters.
- **Elimination pathways:** Degraded and eliminated in the feces. Not metabolized by CYP enzymes or excreted renally or hepatically.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Standard dose is typically 250-500 mg with meals, up to three times daily.  Some supplements provide pepsin in combination with betaine hydrochloride. For these supplements, dosing instructions may vary.
- The dose can be adjusted based on individual needs and tolerance. Some individuals with hypochlorhydria may require higher doses.

#### **Children:**

- Dosage in children should be determined by a physician, based on age and weight.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and monitor for gastrointestinal side effects.  Adjust dose based on tolerance and effectiveness.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are usually necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are usually necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Patients with a history of peptic ulcers or gastritis should exercise caution when using pepsin.  Patients with other comorbid conditions should consult their physician for guidance.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Pepsin is generally not used in hospital settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its primary use is for dyspepsia and other digestive disorders.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Antacids can reduce the effectiveness of pepsin by neutralizing stomach acid.
- Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) also decrease stomach acid and may impact pepsin activity.
- Anti-diabetic drugs like acarbose and miglitol may interact with combination products containing pepsin and diastase.
- Alcohol can worsen heartburn and may exacerbate the symptoms of digestive disorders.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Pregnancy Safety Category: Consult physician, limited safety data available.
