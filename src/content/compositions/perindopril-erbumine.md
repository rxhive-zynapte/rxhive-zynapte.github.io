      What is the recommended dosage for Perindopril erbumine?**


      **A:**  The recommended dosage depends on the indication and
      patient-specific factors. For hypertension, it is usually 4 mg once daily,
      which may be increased to 8 mg if needed. For heart failure and stable
      coronary artery disease, the initial dose is usually lower.  Dose
      adjustments are necessary in elderly patients and patients with renal
      impairment.

## **Usage**

Perindopril erbumine is prescribed for:

*   **Hypertension:**  Managing high blood pressure.
*   **Heart Failure:** Treating mild to moderate heart failure, often in conjunction with other medications like diuretics and digoxin.
*   **Stable Coronary Artery Disease:** Reducing the risk of cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and cardiac arrest) in patients with hypertension or post-myocardial infarction and stable coronary artery disease.

**Pharmacological Classification:**

Perindopril is an Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.

**Mechanism of Action:**

Perindopril inhibits the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. This leads to vasodilation, reduced aldosterone secretion, and decreased sodium and water retention, thereby lowering blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

Perindopril is sometimes referred to as perindopril tert-butylamine.  A related salt is perindopril arginine. Brand names include Aceon, Coversyl, and Prestarium among others. These brand names can vary regionally.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Perindopril's primary effect is to lower blood pressure by reducing peripheral vascular resistance. It also decreases afterload and preload on the heart, improving cardiac output in heart failure patients.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:**  Perindopril is absorbed orally, and its absorption is reduced by food.
*   **Metabolism:** Perindopril is a prodrug metabolized in the liver to its active form, perindoprilat.
*   **Elimination:** Perindoprilat is primarily excreted by the kidneys.  Elimination is reduced in patients with renal impairment.

**Mode of Action:** Perindopril competitively inhibits ACE, the enzyme responsible for converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This inhibition reduces the levels of angiotensin II, decreasing vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Perindopril specifically targets and inhibits ACE.

**Elimination Pathways:** Perindoprilat is primarily eliminated via renal excretion.

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Hypertension:** Initial dose is 4 mg once daily, which may be increased to 8 mg after 2 weeks if needed. The maximum dose is 8mg daily for high blood pressure.
* **Heart Failure:** Initial dose is 2 mg once daily, titrated up to 4 mg as tolerated.
* **Stable Coronary Artery Disease:** Initial dose is 4 mg once daily, increasing to 8 mg daily after 2 weeks if tolerated.


#### **Children:** Use in children is not recommended due to limited safety and efficacy data.



#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Initial dose of 2 mg daily, titrated cautiously based on renal function and tolerance.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment is necessary based on creatinine clearance (CrCl).  Consult dosage guidelines in the prescribing information. Not recommended for those with severe impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min).
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustment recommended, but caution is advised.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient factors such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease when adjusting dosage.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Perindopril's dosage in specialized clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations should be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the patient's hemodynamic status and overall clinical condition. It is not indicated for emergency use in situations such as cardiac arrest or status epilepticus.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be required based on patient-specific factors including renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism. Careful titration and monitoring are essential.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Cough, dizziness, headache, weakness, fatigue, gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain), and low blood pressure.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Angioedema (swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat), severe hypotension, renal failure, liver dysfunction, blood disorders (decreased white blood cells, red blood cells, or platelets), hyperkalemia, and allergic reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic kidney disease and electrolyte imbalances can potentially occur with long-term use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Angioedema, anaphylaxis, and severe hypotension are serious ADRs that necessitate immediate intervention.

## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to perindopril, any ACE inhibitor, or any component of the formulation.
*   History of angioedema related to previous ACE inhibitor therapy.
*   Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema.
*   Pregnancy (second and third trimesters; use during the first trimester is not recommended).
*   Concomitant use with sacubitril/valsartan (neprilysin inhibitor) or aliskiren in patients with diabetes.
*   Bilateral or unilateral renal artery stenosis.

## **Drug Interactions**

Perindopril can interact with various medications, including:

*   Diuretics: Can increase the risk of hypotension.
*   Potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics: Can lead to hyperkalemia.
*   NSAIDs: Can reduce the antihypertensive effect and increase the risk of renal impairment.
*   Lithium: Can increase lithium levels.
*   Other antihypertensive medications: Can have additive hypotensive effects.
*   Sacubitril/valsartan: Increases the risk of angioedema.
*   Aliskiren (in patients with diabetes): Increases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and renal impairment.
*   mTOR inhibitors (e.g. sirolimus, everolimus, temsirolimus): Increased risk of angioedema.
*   Racecadotril: Increased risk of angioedema
*   Gold: Can cause nitritoid reactions.
*   Thrombolytics: Caution advised.

It is essential to consider interactions with OTC drugs, supplements (e.g., potassium-containing salt substitutes), and lifestyle factors like alcohol consumption. Grapefruit juice can increase the risk of side effects and should be avoided.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy:** Perindopril is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and not recommended during the first trimester due to the risk of fetal harm or death.

**Breastfeeding:** Perindopril is excreted in breast milk and is generally not recommended during breastfeeding. The risks and benefits should be assessed individually. If used, monitor the infant closely for hypotension.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** ACE inhibitor, reducing angiotensin II and aldosterone levels.
*   **Side Effects:** Cough, dizziness, headache, hypotension, angioedema, hyperkalemia, renal impairment.
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, angioedema history, pregnancy, sacubitril/valsartan, aliskiren (with diabetes), bilateral renal artery stenosis.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Diuretics, potassium supplements, NSAIDs, lithium, other antihypertensives.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy (2nd/3rd trimesters), not recommended during breastfeeding.
*   **Dosage:** 4 mg/day (hypertension), 2 mg/day (heart failure), initial doses lower in elderly and renal impairment.
*   **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, renal function, serum potassium, and white blood cell counts.

## **Popular Combinations**

Perindopril is often combined with other antihypertensives like thiazide diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide) or calcium channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine) for synergistic blood pressure control. It may also be used with beta-blockers (in heart failure or after a heart attack) and with a statin, anti-platelets and/or nitrates (for reducing cardiovascular risk).
