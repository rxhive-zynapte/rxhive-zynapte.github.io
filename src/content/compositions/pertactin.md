      How does pertactin contribute to the efficacy of acellular pertussis
      vaccines?**


      **A:** Pertactin acts as an adhesin, aiding in the attachment of
      *Bordetella pertussis* to host respiratory cells.  Antibodies against
      pertactin block this adhesion, thus reducing bacterial colonization and
      the risk of infection.

## **Usage**

Pertactin is a component of some acellular pertussis vaccines, including DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis) and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis) vaccines. It is not a standalone medication.  These vaccines are used for active immunization against pertussis (whooping cough).  Pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the bacterium *Bordetella pertussis*.  

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Vaccine, Bacterial vaccine.

**Mechanism of Action:** Pertactin is an outer membrane protein of *Bordetella pertussis* and is considered an adhesin, thought to play a role in the bacteria's attachment to host cells in the respiratory tract. As a vaccine component, pertactin elicits an immune response, producing antibodies that help protect against pertussis infection.


## **Alternate Names**

Pertactin is also known as a 69 kDa outer membrane protein of *Bordetella pertussis*. The abbreviation PRN is often used.  Brand names containing pertactin are part of combination vaccines, and thus, the "pertactin" itself is not marketed under a specific brand name. Examples of vaccines containing pertactin include:

* Infanrix
* Boostrix
* Kinrix
* Pediarix
* Pentacel
* Quadracel
* Daptacel
* Vaxelis



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Pertactin, as a vaccine component, stimulates the production of antibodies against *Bordetella pertussis*.  These antibodies target pertactin on the bacterial surface, impeding the bacteria's ability to adhere to host cells and facilitating their clearance by the immune system.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Pertactin is administered intramuscularly as part of a vaccine.  The pharmacokinetic properties of individual pertussis antigens within combination vaccines are complex and not typically measured individually. The immune response, including antibody titers, is usually the primary focus of pharmacokinetic studies for vaccines. Elimination pathways for the individual antigens are not usually studied separately.


**Mode of Action:**  Pertactin's role as an adhesin is crucial for the bacteria's virulence.  Antibodies generated against vaccine-derived pertactin bind to the bacteria, thereby neutralizing its ability to adhere and colonize the respiratory tract.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Pertactin is an adhesin that may interact with host cell receptors, though the specific receptors involved are not entirely clear. It does not have enzymatic activity or direct effects on neurotransmission.

**Elimination Pathways:**  The elimination pathways for pertactin after vaccination are not routinely studied.


## **Dosage**

Pertactin is administered as a component within combination vaccines.  Therefore, dosage is determined by the overall vaccine formulation and schedule. Please refer to the specific vaccine's prescribing information for detailed dosing instructions.


### **Standard Dosage**

Refer to individual vaccine prescribing information.

#### **Adults:**

Refer to individual vaccine prescribing information.

#### **Children:**

Refer to individual vaccine prescribing information.


#### **Special Cases:**

Refer to individual vaccine prescribing information.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Pertactin-containing vaccines are used for routine immunization against pertussis in infants, children, adolescents, and adults, including pregnant women.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Refer to individual vaccine prescribing information.



## **Side Effects**

Side effects are generally related to the combined vaccine rather than the individual pertactin component.


### **Common Side Effects**

Common side effects associated with pertussis-containing vaccines can include pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site, mild fever, irritability, drowsiness, and decreased appetite.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Serious allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), seizures, and neurological events (encephalopathy) have been reported, although extremely rare.


### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term side effects specifically related to pertactin are not established.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions and neurological complications are potential ADRs, though infrequent.





## **Contraindications**

Contraindications for pertussis-containing vaccines typically include a history of severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine or any of its components, or encephalopathy within 7 days of a prior dose of a pertussis-containing vaccine.




## **Drug Interactions**

Refer to the specific vaccine's prescribing information for drug interactions. Co-administration with other vaccines is generally well-tolerated, though antibody responses to some antigens might be slightly reduced.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pertussis-containing vaccines, including those with pertactin, are recommended for pregnant women, preferably between 20 and 32 weeks gestation, to protect both the mother and the newborn.  These vaccines are considered safe during breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

**Mechanism of Action:**  Vaccine component eliciting immune response against *Bordetella pertussis*.

**Side Effects:**  Generally mild and localized to the injection site. Rare but serious reactions are possible.

**Contraindications:**  Previous severe allergic reaction or encephalopathy following a pertussis-containing vaccine.

**Drug Interactions:** Refer to specific vaccine information.

**Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Recommended during pregnancy and safe during breastfeeding.

**Dosage:**  Administered as a component of combination vaccines; dosage depends on the specific vaccine.

**Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitoring primarily focuses on adverse event reporting after vaccination. Antibody titers can be assessed in research settings, but are not routinely measured in clinical practice.




## **Popular Combinations**

Pertactin is typically included in combination vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. Some vaccines also include inactivated poliovirus, *Haemophilus influenzae* type b, and/or hepatitis B vaccines.


## **Precautions**

Standard precautions for vaccine administration should be followed.
