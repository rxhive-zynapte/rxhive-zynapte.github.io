## **Usage**

Pertuzumab is prescribed for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. This includes:

* **Early-stage breast cancer:** Used in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant (before surgery) and adjuvant (after surgery) settings for patients at high risk of recurrence.
* **Metastatic breast cancer:** Used in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for patients who haven't received prior anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Monoclonal antibody; antineoplastic agent.

**Mechanism of Action:** Pertuzumab targets HER2, a protein overexpressed in certain breast cancers. It binds to a specific region of HER2, preventing it from pairing with other HER receptors (dimerization), thus blocking cancer cell growth signals.  It also promotes antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).


## **Alternate Names**

**International Nonproprietary Name (INN):**  Pertuzumab

**Brand Name:** Perjeta, Phesgo (in combination with trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-zzfx)



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Pertuzumab primarily works by inhibiting HER2 signaling pathways, leading to cell growth arrest and apoptosis (programmed cell death).  This effect is enhanced when combined with trastuzumab, which binds to a different part of HER2.  Pertuzumab also facilitates ADCC, whereby immune cells destroy the cancer cells.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Administered intravenously; steady-state concentration reached after the first maintenance dose. Subcutaneous administration is available with Phesgo (combined with trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-zzfx for increased absorption).
* **Metabolism:** Primarily cleared by catabolism (protein breakdown), similar to other antibodies.  Not metabolized by CYP enzymes.
* **Elimination:** Half-life approximately 18 days (can vary depending on disease state).


**Mode of Action:**  Pertuzumab binds to subdomain II of the extracellular dimerization domain of HER2, blocking ligand-dependent heterodimerization with other HER family members. This inhibits signaling through the MAP kinase and PI3K pathways, leading to growth arrest and apoptosis.

**Receptor Binding:** Binds specifically to HER2.

**Enzyme Inhibition:** Inhibits downstream signaling pathways like MAP kinase and PI3K.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily catabolism, with some renal elimination.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Initial dose:** 840 mg IV infusion over 60 minutes.
* **Maintenance dose:** 420 mg IV infusion over 30-60 minutes every 3 weeks.
* **Phesgo (SC):**  1200 mg/600 mg loading dose, followed by 600 mg/600 mg maintenance dose every 3 weeks.

#### **Children:**  Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment necessary for mild to moderate impairment.  Not studied in severe renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Not formally studied; use with caution.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring for cardiac dysfunction is essential, especially in patients with pre-existing heart conditions or those receiving anthracyclines.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Pertuzumab's use in intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations isn't directly indicated.  Its core applications are specifically for HER2-positive breast cancer.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

No routine dose adjustments based on body weight, age, or gender are required. For missed doses, administer as soon as possible and resume the regular schedule. If more than 6 weeks have passed since the last dose, re-administer the loading dose.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Diarrhea, nausea, alopecia (hair loss), fatigue, rash, peripheral neuropathy (numbness/tingling), neutropenia (low white blood cell count), upper respiratory infections, sore mouth.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Left ventricular dysfunction/heart failure, embryo-fetal toxicity (if used during pregnancy), hypersensitivity reactions (including fever, chills, difficulty breathing), pulmonary toxicity.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic heart problems (including heart failure) can occur with prolonged use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Cardiomyopathy, severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, severe hypersensitivity reactions.




## **Contraindications**

Known hypersensitivity to pertuzumab.



## **Drug Interactions**

Anthracyclines (increased risk of cardiotoxicity). Use with caution with other drugs that can prolong the QT interval.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Pertuzumab can cause fetal harm and should be avoided during pregnancy. Effective contraception is necessary during treatment and for 7 months after the last dose.

**Breastfeeding:** Pertuzumab may pass into breast milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for 7 months after the last dose.

* **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, nausea, alopecia, fatigue, rash, neuropathy, neutropenia, cardiotoxicity.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to pertuzumab.
* **Drug Interactions:** Anthracyclines, QT prolonging drugs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy; not recommended during breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** 840 mg loading dose, then 420 mg every 3 weeks IV; Phesgo SC available.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** LVEF, complete blood count, signs of hypersensitivity or cardiotoxicity.


## **Popular Combinations**

* Trastuzumab and docetaxel (for metastatic breast cancer)
* Trastuzumab and chemotherapy regimens (for early breast cancer)


## **Precautions**

* Monitor cardiac function (LVEF) before, during, and after treatment.
* Monitor blood counts due to the risk of neutropenia.
* Patients should use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months after the last dose.
