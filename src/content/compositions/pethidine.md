## **Usage**

Pethidine is prescribed for the relief of moderate to severe acute pain.  Examples include pain during labor, pre- and post-operative pain, and pain associated with trauma or other acute medical conditions.  It's also occasionally used as an adjunct to anesthesia.

It is pharmacologically classified as an opioid analgesic.

Pethidine's mechanism of action involves binding to opioid receptors (primarily mu-opioid receptors) in the central nervous system, reducing pain perception and the emotional response to pain.

## **Alternate Names**

* Meperidine (International Nonproprietary Name, INN)

Some popular brand names include Demerol and Dolantal.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Pethidine primarily acts as a mu-opioid receptor agonist. It binds to these receptors in the brain, spinal cord, and other tissues, mimicking the effects of endogenous opioid peptides. This leads to decreased pain perception, altered emotional response to pain, and sedation. It also has some anticholinergic and local anesthetic properties. Unlike other opioids, pethidine does not cause miosis due to its anticholinergic properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Pethidine is well-absorbed following intramuscular (IM) and subcutaneous (SC) administration, with peak plasma concentrations reached within 30-60 minutes and 60-90 minutes respectively. Oral absorption is less reliable due to significant first-pass metabolism. It can also be administered intravenously (IV) for a rapid onset of action.
* **Metabolism:** It is primarily metabolized in the liver to norpethidine, an active metabolite with a longer half-life and potential for neurotoxicity (causing tremors, muscle twitching, and seizures).  This is particularly relevant in patients with renal impairment as norpethidine accumulates. Pethidine is metabolized mainly by CYP2B6 and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4.
* **Elimination:** Pethidine and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. Elimination is reduced in neonates and patients with renal impairment.

**Mode of Action:** Pethidine binds to mu-opioid receptors, inhibiting neuronal activity by reducing neurotransmitter release (such as substance P and glutamate) and hyperpolarizing postsynaptic neurons. It also modulates pain pathways at the spinal cord level.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Primarily a mu-opioid receptor agonist; also inhibits reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine; moderate anticholinergic activity.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
* **Moderate to Severe Pain:** 25-150 mg IM or SC every 3-4 hours as needed. 25-50 mg IV every 3-4 hours as needed. Oral administration: 50-150 mg every 3-4 hours as needed.
* **Obstetric Analgesia:** 50-100 mg IM or SC, repeatable every 1-3 hours as needed, up to a maximum of 400 mg in 24 hours.
* **Premedication:** 50-100 mg IM or SC 30-90 minutes prior to the operation.
* **Adjunct to General Anesthesia:** 10-25 mg IV as needed.

#### **Children:**
* **Moderate to Severe Pain:** 0.5-2 mg/kg IM or SC every 3-4 hours as needed (maximum single dose of 100 mg).
* **Premedication:** 1-2 mg/kg IM or SC 30-90 minutes before anesthesia (maximum single dose of 100 mg).
Use a small graduated syringe for accurate administration. Dilute the solution with Water for Injections if graduated syringes are not available.

#### **Special Cases:**
* **Elderly Patients:** Initiate therapy at the lower end of the dosing range due to increased sensitivity.  Start with a maximum of 25 mg.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is necessary due to the risk of norpethidine accumulation. In severe renal impairment, Pethidine is contraindicated.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dose reduction is necessary in moderate to severe hepatic impairment as metabolism is affected.  Severe hepatic dysfunction is a relative contraindication to the use of pethidine.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use caution in patients with respiratory disease, head injury, increased intracranial pressure, seizures, prostatic hypertrophy, biliary tract disorders, hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and cardiovascular disease.


### **Clinical Use Cases**
* **Intubation:** Pethidine is not typically used for intubation itself, but may be part of an analgesic regimen for post-intubation pain management.
* **Surgical Procedures:** Used for pre- and post-operative pain management, and sometimes intraoperatively as an adjunct to general anesthesia.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** Pethidine is not typically used for patients solely on mechanical ventilation but may be used as part of a pain management regimen for ventilated patients experiencing moderate to severe pain.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Used cautiously for pain management in critically ill patients, with careful attention to respiratory status and potential drug interactions.
* **Emergency Situations:** In select emergency situations, it may be used for short-term pain control.


### **Dosage Adjustments**
Dose adjustments are necessary based on patient-specific factors, including age, renal or hepatic function, and presence of comorbid conditions.
