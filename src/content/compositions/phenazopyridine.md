## **Usage**

Phenazopyridine is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency, frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the lower urinary tract mucosa. This irritation can be caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters.  It is classified as a urinary tract analgesic.

Phenazopyridine's mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is believed to exert a local anesthetic or analgesic effect on the lining of the urinary tract.

## **Alternate Names**

Phenazopyridine is also known by various brand names, including Pyridium, Azo-Standard, Uristat, AZO, and Prodium.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Phenazopyridine exerts a topical analgesic effect on the urinary tract mucosa. The exact mechanism is not well-elucidated, but it's thought to act locally, possibly by interfering with mucosal sensory transduction.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:** Phenazopyridine is well-absorbed after oral administration, preferably taken with or after meals.
* **Metabolism:** It undergoes hepatic metabolism, producing potentially active and/or toxic metabolites.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated renally as unchanged drug and metabolites.

The mode of action at the cellular level is not fully understood; receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation haven't been clearly identified.  Renal excretion is the main elimination pathway.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

200 mg three times a day after meals.  Maximum daily dose is 600 mg.  When used concomitantly with an antibiotic for a urinary tract infection (UTI), the duration of phenazopyridine use should not exceed two days.

#### **Children:**

Children aged 6 to 11 years:  4 mg/kg three times a day after meals, not exceeding two days when used with an antibiotic for UTI. Safety and effectiveness have not been established in children under 6.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary due to potential age-related decline in renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance <50 mL/min.  For CrCl 50-80 mL/min, the interval between doses should be increased to every 8â€“16 hours.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustment is recommended due to hepatic metabolism of the drug, although specific guidelines aren't available.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution in patients with G6PD deficiency due to increased risk of hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Phenazopyridine is specifically indicated for symptomatic relief of urinary tract discomfort and not for other clinical scenarios such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use.  It plays no role in the management of emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary for renal impairment as described above. No specific dosage adjustments are available for hepatic dysfunction or other metabolic disorders.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Headache, dizziness, stomach upset, discoloration of urine (orange to red).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Methemoglobinemia, hemolytic anemia, acute renal failure, hepatic toxicity, jaundice.

### **Long-Term Effects**

No specific long-term effects associated with short-term use; prolonged use is not recommended.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

As above, methemoglobinemia, hemolytic anemia, acute renal failure, and hepatic toxicity require immediate intervention.


## **Contraindications**

Renal insufficiency, severe hepatitis, hypersensitivity to phenazopyridine.

## **Drug Interactions**

No clinically significant drug interactions have been reported.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category B. Animal studies have not shown fetal harm, but there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.  Use during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is unknown whether phenazopyridine is excreted in breast milk.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Local analgesic effect on the urinary tract mucosa.
* **Side Effects:** Headache, dizziness, stomach upset, urine discoloration.  Rarely: methemoglobinemia, hemolytic anemia, acute renal failure, hepatic toxicity.
* **Contraindications:** Renal insufficiency, severe hepatitis, hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:** None known.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category B; use only if clearly needed. Excretion in breast milk unknown.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 200 mg TID after meals, max 2 days for UTI. Children (6-11): 4 mg/kg TID after meals, max 2 days for UTI.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Observe for signs of methemoglobinemia, hemolytic anemia, and hepatic or renal dysfunction.  Monitor urine output and color.

## **Popular Combinations**

Often used concomitantly with antibiotics for the initial two days of UTI treatment.

## **Precautions**

Avoid in patients with renal impairment or severe liver disease.  Discontinue if signs of hemolytic anemia, methemoglobinemia, or hepatic/renal dysfunction appear. Do not use for more than two days for UTI treatment alongside antibiotics.
