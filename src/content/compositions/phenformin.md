      What are the contraindications for Phenformin?**


      **A:** Phenformin is contraindicated in patients with renal impairment,
      hepatic dysfunction, heart failure, and other conditions that increase the
      risk of lactic acidosis.  It is also contraindicated in pregnancy and

      Are there any alternative medications to Phenformin?**


      **A:**  Metformin is a safer biguanide medication used to treat type 2
      diabetes.  Other classes of antidiabetic drugs are also available, such as
      sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and GLP-1 receptor agonists.

      How is lactic acidosis treated?**


      **A:**  Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and requires intensive
      supportive therapy.  This may include intravenous fluids, sodium
      bicarbonate to correct acidosis, and measures to improve tissue
      oxygenation.  Hemodialysis may be necessary to remove phenformin and
      lactate from the circulation.

## **Usage**

- Phenformin was formerly prescribed for type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It is no longer used clinically due to a high risk of lactic acidosis.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Biguanide, Antidiabetic Agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Phenformin works by decreasing glucose absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, increasing insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in tissues, and inhibiting gluconeogenesis in the liver.  It requires the presence of insulin to exert its hypoglycemic effect and does not stimulate insulin release. It activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibits mTORC1 signaling. It may also impair vitamin B12 absorption.


## **Alternate Names**

-  DBI (former brand name)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Phenformin lowers blood glucose levels primarily by increasing peripheral glucose utilization and decreasing hepatic glucose production.  It does not affect insulin secretion.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Phenformin is absorbed orally and metabolized in the liver. It is excreted renally.  
- **Mode of Action:** Phenformin activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which plays a central role in cellular energy homeostasis. AMPK activation leads to increased glucose uptake and utilization in peripheral tissues and inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

Phenformin is no longer prescribed due to safety concerns. Therefore, dosage information is not applicable.  It was previously administered orally, with dosages ranging from 50 to 150 mg per day, divided into two or three doses.

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**
- Gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, metallic taste).
- Weight loss.
- Skin reactions.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Lactic acidosis (a life-threatening condition).
- Cardiovascular adverse effects.
- Acute pancreatitis.
- Jaundice.

### **Long-Term Effects**
- Vitamin B12 deficiency (due to impaired absorption).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
- Lactic acidosis is a clinically significant ADR requiring immediate medical intervention.


## **Contraindications**

- Renal impairment.
- Hepatic dysfunction.
- Heart failure.
- Recent myocardial infarction.
- Severe infection.
- Diabetic coma.
- Ketoacidosis.
- Dehydration.
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Cimetidine: May reduce renal clearance of phenformin, increasing the risk of lactic acidosis.
- Alcohol: Increases the risk of lactic acidosis.
- Nephrotoxic drugs: May exacerbate renal impairment and increase the risk of lactic acidosis.
- Numerous other drug interactions exist (see sources).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Phenformin is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to the risk of lactic acidosis in the mother and potential harm to the fetus or infant.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Increases insulin sensitivity, decreases glucose absorption and hepatic glucose production.
- **Side Effects:**  GI disturbances, lactic acidosis, cardiovascular events.
- **Contraindications:** Renal impairment, hepatic dysfunction, heart failure, pregnancy.
- **Drug Interactions:** Cimetidine, alcohol, nephrotoxic drugs.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.


## **Popular Combinations**

Phenformin is not used in current clinical practice, therefore, no popular combinations exist.



## **Precautions**

Phenformin is no longer used clinically due to significant safety risks.
