## **Usage**

Pheniramine maleate is an antihistamine primarily used to relieve symptoms associated with allergies, such as hay fever, rhinitis, urticaria, and angioedema. It can also be prescribed for motion sickness, allergic conjunctivitis, drug rashes, serum sickness, food allergy, and itching skin conditions (e.g., eczema, neurodermatitis, lichen planus). Its pharmacological classification is antihistamine (H1-receptor antagonist).  Pheniramine works by blocking the effects of histamine, a substance released by the body during allergic reactions.

## **Alternate Names**

Pheniramine maleate is the generic name. A popular brand name is Avil.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Pheniramine competitively antagonizes the H1-receptor. Besides its antihistaminic activity, it also possesses anticholinergic and sedative properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Pheniramine is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
* **Metabolism:** It is metabolized in the liver primarily via CYP450 enzymes,  to N-desmethylpheniramine and N-didesmethylpheniramine.
* **Elimination:** Pheniramine is excreted mainly through the kidneys, both as the parent drug and its metabolites.

**Mode of Action:**  Pheniramine competes with histamine for binding at H1-receptor sites, effectively reducing the effects of histamine on tissues and organs. This reduces vasodilation, capillary permeability, and smooth muscle contraction caused by histamine, alleviating the symptoms of allergic reactions.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  The usual starting dose is 25 mg every 4 to 6 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 150 mg.

#### **Children (5-10 years):**  12.5 mg (half a 25 mg tablet) every 4 to 6 hours, as needed. 

#### **Children (under 5 years):** Not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and monitor closely.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment is needed. The exact amount should be determined by a physician based on the degree of impairment. 
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is needed in patients with asthma, glaucoma, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, BPH, or hyperthyroidism.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Pheniramine's use in intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations is not routinely indicated. Its primary applications are the management of allergic reactions and motion sickness.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments should be made in the presence of renal or hepatic impairment and may be necessary in individuals with other comorbid conditions.  Always consider the patient's overall condition and consult with specialists when necessary.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth/nose/throat, headache, upset stomach, constipation, blurred vision.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Confusion, hallucinations, ringing in the ears, difficulty urinating, fast/irregular heartbeat, seizures, allergic reactions (rash, itching/swelling, trouble breathing).

### **Long-Term Effects**

No specific long-term side effects have been routinely reported, but prolonged use should be monitored by a physician.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema, require immediate medical intervention.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to pheniramine, concomitant use of MAOIs (or within two weeks of MAOI discontinuation), narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, severe cardiovascular disease, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy.

## **Drug Interactions**

Alcohol, sedatives, opioids, barbiturates, hypnotics, MAOIs, atropine, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), other antihistamines (especially topical ones), and drugs metabolized by CYP450 enzymes.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety: Safety is not well established, use only if clearly needed and under the guidance of a physician.

Breastfeeding: Excreted in breast milk, may cause drowsiness in infants; non-sedating antihistamines are preferred during breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** H1-receptor antagonist.
* **Side Effects:** Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, blurred vision.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, MAOI use, narrow-angle glaucoma.
* **Drug Interactions:** Alcohol, CNS depressants, MAOIs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution.
* **Dosage:** 25 mg every 4-6 hours (adults); adjust for children and special populations.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Observe for adverse reactions, especially drowsiness and anticholinergic effects.

## **Popular Combinations**

Pheniramine is sometimes combined with other medications, like phenylephrine (a decongestant) for treating cold symptoms. However, such combinations should be used with caution due to potential additive effects.

## **Precautions**

Pre-existing conditions, particularly glaucoma, asthma, cardiovascular disease, prostatic hypertrophy, or diabetes, should be carefully assessed before prescribing pheniramine.
