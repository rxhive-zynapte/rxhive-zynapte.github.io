      What is cathartic colon?**


      **A:** Cathartic colon is a condition characterized by colonic denervation
      and atony, resulting in decreased motility and potentially leading to
      chronic constipation. It can be caused by the long-term misuse of
      stimulant laxatives like phenolphthalein.

## **Usage**

- Phenolphthalein is primarily prescribed for the short-term symptomatic relief of constipation.  It is also used for bowel cleansing before medical procedures such as colonoscopies or surgeries.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Stimulant laxative.
- **Mechanism of action:** Phenolphthalein stimulates intestinal motility by irritating the smooth muscle of the intestinal wall and increasing water and electrolyte secretion into the intestinal lumen.  This leads to increased peristalsis and bowel evacuation.

## **Alternate Names**

- No officially recognized alternate names.
- **Brand names:**  Many brand names previously contained phenolphthalein but it has been withdrawn from the U.S. market. Some previous brand names included Correctol and Ex-Lax (now formulated with different active ingredients).  Some brands containing phenolphthalein may still be available in other countries.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Phenolphthalein increases intestinal motility and fluid accumulation in the colon, leading to bowel evacuation.  It acts primarily on the large intestine (colon).
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Absorption:  Up to 15% of an oral dose is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
    - Metabolism: Absorbed phenolphthalein is conjugated in the liver (primarily glucuronidation).
    - Elimination: Excreted primarily in the feces as both free and conjugated forms. A small amount is excreted in the urine, particularly after larger doses.  The enterohepatic circulation may prolong the drug's effect.  Urine may turn pink or red in alkaline conditions due to the presence of phenolphthalein.

## **Dosage**

Phenolphthalein is no longer available in many countries, including the US, due to safety concerns.  The following information is provided for historical reference only and should not be interpreted as current recommendations for clinical practice.

### **Standard Dosage (Historical)**

#### **Adults:**

- 30–200 mg daily, taken at bedtime. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 270 mg.

#### **Children:**

- 2-5 years: 15–30 mg daily.
- 6-11 years: 30–60 mg daily.
- 12 years and older:  Follow adult dosing.

#### **Special Cases:**

Due to the potential risks, phenolphthalein is generally not recommended for use in the elderly, patients with renal or hepatic impairment, or those with comorbid conditions.  Safer alternatives should be considered.

### **Clinical Use Cases (Not applicable anymore due to safety concerns)**


Phenolphthalein is no longer recommended for clinical use, particularly in intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations. 

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Abdominal cramps
- Diarrhea
- Skin rash
- Discoloration of urine (pink or red in alkaline conditions)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Electrolyte imbalances (with prolonged use)
- Cathartic colon (with chronic use)


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to phenolphthalein
- Intestinal obstruction
- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Undiagnosed abdominal pain
- Acute surgical abdomen

## **Drug Interactions**

- Antacids: May reduce the effectiveness of phenolphthalein.
- Diuretics and corticosteroids:  May increase the risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
- Other medications:  May interfere with the absorption of other orally administered drugs due to increased gastrointestinal transit.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Not established. Due to potential risks, phenolphthalein is generally avoided during pregnancy.
- **Breastfeeding:** Phenolphthalein may be excreted in breast milk and could cause diarrhea in infants. It is generally avoided during breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Stimulant laxative that irritates the intestinal wall and increases fluid secretion.

- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, intestinal obstruction, inflammatory bowel disease, undiagnosed abdominal pain, acute surgical abdomen.
- **Drug Interactions:** Antacids, diuretics, corticosteroids, other orally administered medications.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Generally avoided due to potential risks.
