## **Usage**

- Phenoxybenzamine is prescribed for the control of hypertension episodes associated with pheochromocytoma. It is also sometimes used off-label for micturition disorders.
- **Pharmacological classification:**  Alpha-adrenergic blocking agent (specifically, a non-selective, non-competitive alpha-blocker).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Phenoxybenzamine irreversibly binds to alpha-adrenergic receptors, preventing catecholamines (like norepinephrine and epinephrine) from binding and exerting their vasoconstricting effects.  This leads to vasodilation and a decrease in blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

-  Dibenzyline (brand name)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Phenoxybenzamine primarily blocks alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, leading to peripheral vasodilation and a decrease in blood pressure.  It also blocks alpha-2 receptors, which can increase norepinephrine release, leading to reflex tachycardia.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Administered orally. Phenoxybenzamine is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  It undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism, resulting in lower bioavailability. It is highly lipophilic and distributes widely throughout the body. Metabolism is complex, and elimination is primarily via renal and biliary routes.
- **Mode of Action:** Irreversible binding to alpha-adrenergic receptors.
- **Receptor Binding:** Non-selective and non-competitive antagonist of alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Renal and biliary excretion of metabolites.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Initial dose:** 10 mg orally once or twice daily.
- **Maintenance dose:**  The dose should be increased by 10 mg daily until blood pressure control is achieved or postural hypotension becomes troublesome. The usual maintenance dose is 20-40 mg orally 2-3 times per day. Doses as high as 240 mg daily have been reported. The optimal dose is determined by blood pressure response.

#### **Children:**

- **Initial Dose:** 0.2 mg/kg/dose orally once daily.
- **Maintenance Dose:** The dose can be slowly increased by 0.2 mg/kg daily to a maximum of 1.2 mg/kg/day divided three to four times a day.
- **Pediatric safety considerations:**  Experience in pediatric patients is limited. Use with caution.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose (10 mg daily) and titrate cautiously due to increased sensitivity to side effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution; dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use cautiously in patients with cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Phenoxybenzamine's primary clinical use is the preoperative management of pheochromocytoma.  Dosage is titrated to control blood pressure and minimize perioperative complications.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are made based on individual patient response and tolerance. Monitor blood pressure and heart rate closely when adjusting doses.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Nasal congestion
- Orthostatic hypotension
- Dizziness
- Drowsiness/Fatigue
- Miosis (constricted pupils)
- Reflex tachycardia
- Inhibited ejaculation/Retrograde ejaculation
- Gastrointestinal irritation

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
- Syncope (fainting)
- Severe hypotension


### **Long-Term Effects**

- Potential for carcinogenic effects with long-term use; thus, long-term use is not recommended.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

-  Severe hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, and reflex tachycardia require immediate intervention.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to phenoxybenzamine.
- Conditions where a fall in blood pressure is undesirable (e.g., cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction recovery period, severe coronary artery disease).

## **Drug Interactions**

- Drugs that stimulate alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors (can exacerbate hypotension and tachycardia).
- Blood pressure medications (additive hypotensive effects).
- CYP450 interactions: While phenoxybenzamine's metabolism is complex, it doesn't have strong CYP450 interactions.
- OTC drugs and supplements: Interactions with OTC medications are not extensively studied.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C. Phenoxybenzamine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
- Fetal risks: Potential teratogenic effects.
- Drug excretion in breast milk: Unknown. Avoid breastfeeding while on Phenoxybenzamine.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Irreversible alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade.
- **Side Effects:** Orthostatic hypotension, reflex tachycardia, nasal congestion, dizziness, miosis, inhibited ejaculation.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, conditions where hypotension is hazardous.
- **Drug Interactions:** Alpha/beta agonists, antihypertensives.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category C; use with caution if benefits outweigh risks. Not recommended while breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** Adults: Start 10mg BID, increase to 20-40mg TID. Children: 0.2-1.2 mg/kg/day in 3-4 divided doses.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, heart rate.

## **Popular Combinations**

Beta-blockers are sometimes used in conjunction with phenoxybenzamine, particularly when managing tachycardia associated with pheochromocytoma.


## **Precautions**

-  Monitor blood pressure and heart rate carefully, especially during dose titration.
- Educate patients about the risk of orthostatic hypotension.
