## **Usage**

Phenoxyethanol is primarily used as a preservative in cosmetic products, perfumes, and soaps. It is also used as a preservative in some vaccines and medications.  It is **not** typically prescribed as a standalone medication for treating medical conditions.  Its pharmacological classification is as a **preservative** with antibacterial and antifungal properties. Its mechanism of action involves disrupting the cell walls of bacteria and fungi, leading to cell death.  It is occasionally used in topical pharmaceutical formulations.

## **Alternate Names**

- 2-Phenoxyethanol
- Ethylene glycol monophenyl ether
- PhE
- Dowanol
- Arosol
- Phenoxetol
- Rose ether
- Phenoxyethyl alcohol
- Beta-hydroxyethyl phenyl ether
- Euxyl KÂ® 400 (mixture of Phenoxyethanol and 1,2-dibromo-2,4-dicyanobutane)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Phenoxyethanol acts as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, effective against various Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, yeasts, and molds. It disrupts the cell wall of microorganisms, causing leakage of intracellular components and ultimately cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  When applied topically, phenoxyethanol is absorbed through the skin, with estimates ranging from 47% to 85% absorption. It is metabolized primarily in the liver to phenoxyacetic acid, which is then excreted in the urine.  A small amount may be excreted unchanged in the urine or exhaled.

**Mode of Action:** Phenoxyethanol's primary mode of action involves disrupting the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane of microorganisms, affecting membrane permeability and causing cell lysis.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  The primary mechanism of action is not related to receptor binding, enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion, following hepatic metabolism to phenoxyacetic acid. A small percentage may also be excreted unchanged in the urine or exhaled.


## **Dosage**

Phenoxyethanol is **not** typically prescribed as a standalone medication, therefore standard dosage guidelines for treating medical conditions do not exist.  As a preservative in cosmetics and personal care products, the typical concentration used is 0.5% to 1%.  Higher concentrations may be used in other applications.
