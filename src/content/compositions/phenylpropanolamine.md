      How does Phenylpropanolamine work to control urinary incontinence?**

      **A:** Phenylpropanolamine stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors in the
      urethral sphincter, causing the muscle to contract and increasing its
      tone, which helps to prevent urine leakage.

      More frequent monitoring may be necessary in patients with pre-existing
      conditions that predispose them to hypertension.

## **Usage**

Phenylpropanolamine is primarily prescribed for the control of urinary incontinence in dogs due to urethral sphincter hypotonus. It was previously used in humans as a nasal decongestant for the common cold and as an appetite suppressant for weight loss, but these uses have been discontinued due to an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke.  Its pharmacological classification is sympathomimetic agent. Phenylpropanolamine acts by stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors in the urethral sphincter, causing the muscle to contract and increasing its tone, thereby reducing urine leakage.

## **Alternate Names**

Phenylpropanolamine is also known as PPA.  Brand names for veterinary use include Proin and Proin ER.  Numerous brand names were previously used for human formulations.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Phenylpropanolamine is an indirectly acting sympathomimetic amine.  It acts primarily as a norepinephrine-releasing agent, stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors in the smooth muscle of the urethra. This stimulation leads to contraction of the urethral sphincter, increasing resistance to urine flow and reducing incontinence.  Systemic effects may include elevated heart rate and blood pressure.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Phenylpropanolamine is well-absorbed orally. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily by the kidneys. Extended-release formulations provide sustained drug levels over a 24-hour period.  Concomitant administration with food slows the absorption of extended-release formulations but does not affect overall bioavailability.

**Mode of Action:**  Phenylpropanolamine indirectly activates adrenergic receptors by increasing the release of norepinephrine from presynaptic nerve terminals.  This increased norepinephrine concentration in the synaptic cleft leads to stimulation of postsynaptic alpha-adrenergic receptors in the urethral sphincter.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion, with some hepatic metabolism.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (Canine):**

* **Proin Chewable Tablets:** 2 mg/kg body weight orally twice daily.
* **Proin ER Extended-Release Tablets:** 2-4 mg/kg body weight orally once daily, administered with food.  Do not split or crush tablets.  Dogs weighing less than 10 lbs cannot be safely dosed with Proin ER.

#### **Children (Canine):**  Pediatric dosing should be based on weight, following the guidelines for adult dogs.

#### **Special Cases (Canine):**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution and monitor blood pressure closely.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce dosage and monitor closely for signs of toxicity.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, or other conditions that may predispose to hypertension or be exacerbated by sympathomimetic effects.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Phenylpropanolamine is not indicated for use in clinical scenarios such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations in human medicine.  Its primary clinical use is for the management of urinary incontinence in dogs.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary based on patient response and the presence of comorbidities. Regular blood pressure monitoring is essential, especially for patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions or those receiving concurrent medications that may interact with phenylpropanolamine.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Restlessness, increased thirst, loss of appetite, irritability, vomiting, diarrhea, difficulty urinating.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Seizures, hypertension, stroke-like symptoms (e.g., ataxia, paresis), cardiac arrhythmias, collapse.

### **Long-Term Effects:**
Chronic hypertension may develop with prolonged use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
Hypertensive crisis, hemorrhagic stroke (rare but serious).


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to phenylpropanolamine.

* **Side Effects:** Restlessness, increased thirst, loss of appetite, irritability, hypertension, seizures (rare).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, pregnancy, concurrent MAOI use.
* **Drug Interactions:** MAOIs, TCAs, NSAIDs, sympathomimetics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy, use with caution during breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:**  Varies depending on formulation and patient, typically 2-4 mg/kg once or twice daily for dogs.

## **Popular Combinations**

In veterinary medicine, phenylpropanolamine may be used in combination with estrogens (e.g., diethylstilbestrol, estriol) for the treatment of urinary incontinence in spayed female dogs.

## **Precautions**

* Monitor blood pressure regularly, especially in patients at risk for hypertension.
* Ensure adequate water intake.
* Use with caution in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, renal or hepatic dysfunction, diabetes, or glaucoma.
