## **Usage**

- Phenyramidol is prescribed for the relief of mild to moderate acute pain associated with musculoskeletal disorders such as lumbago (lower back pain), integumental pain (skin pain), and other musculoskeletal pain conditions, including neck and shoulder pain and pain associated with muscle spasms (e.g., from strains or sprains). It is often recommended to combine this medication with rest and physical therapy.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Skeletal muscle relaxant, analgesic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Phenyramidol primarily works by inhibiting polysynaptic reflexes within the brain and spinal cord, thus disrupting the transmission of pain signals from the nerves to the brain. This action helps to alleviate muscle stiffness and spasms, consequently improving muscle strength. It may also modulate the effects of certain neurotransmitters in the central nervous system like serotonin, norepinephrine, GABA, and glycine, further contributing to muscle relaxation.

## **Alternate Names**

- **INN:** Fenyramidol
- **Brand Names:** Cabral, Realflex

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Phenyramidol acts centrally to reduce the excitability of motor neurons, primarily in the spinal cord and brainstem. This leads to muscle relaxation and a reduction in painful muscle contractions and spasms. The drug's analgesic effect stems from its interference with pain signal transmission in the central nervous system.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Phenyramidol is administered orally and is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Its metabolism and elimination pathways are not extensively documented in the provided literature. However, one source mentions hepatic metabolism as a possible pathway. It is known to inhibit the metabolism of certain drugs, including phenytoin, tolbutamide, bishydroxycoumarin, zoxazolamine, and pentobarbital.  This can lead to elevated plasma concentrations of these co-administered drugs, potentially increasing the risk of adverse effects.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The typical adult dosage is 400 mg (one to two tablets) taken two to three times a day, preferably after meals.
- Treatment duration is generally 3 to 7 days, depending on the severity of the condition.
- Maximum daily dose should not exceed 3200 mg.

#### **Children:**

- Phenyramidol is not recommended for use in children under 16 years of age due to insufficient safety and efficacy data.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate treatment with a lower dose and adjust as needed based on clinical response and tolerability. Closely consider comorbidities and potential drug interactions.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use cautiously and monitor renal function. Dosage adjustments might be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Administer with caution. Monitor liver function tests, especially liver enzymes.  Dosage adjustments might be required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with diabetes, those taking anticoagulants (like warfarin), or anticonvulsants due to possible drug interactions. Monitor blood glucose, INR, and plasma levels of the interacting drugs as appropriate.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Phenyramidol is primarily used for acute musculoskeletal pain management. It is not typically utilized in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are necessary based on patient-specific factors such as renal or hepatic dysfunction.

    - Alcohol: Avoid concurrent consumption due to increased risk of drowsiness, dizziness, and potentially stomach bleeding.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Limited data are available. Use with caution if potential benefits outweigh the risks. It has been considered highly unsafe in some sources.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Limited data are available. Potential for neonatal exposure. Use with caution if benefits outweigh the risks to the infant.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits polysynaptic reflexes in the CNS, leading to muscle relaxation and analgesia.

- **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests, blood glucose (in diabetics), INR (in patients on warfarin), plasma levels of concomitant anticonvulsants.

## **Popular Combinations**

No consistently documented "popular" drug combinations with phenyramidol are clinically recommended. Combining phenyramidol with other drugs should be done cautiously due to potential drug interactions.
