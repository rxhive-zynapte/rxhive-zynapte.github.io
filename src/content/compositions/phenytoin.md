## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Phenytoin is an anticonvulsant primarily prescribed for the management of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, focal (partial) seizures, and status epilepticus. It is also used for seizure prophylaxis during or following neurosurgery, and occasionally for certain cardiac arrhythmias unresponsive to conventional treatments.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Anticonvulsant, antiepileptic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Phenytoin stabilizes neuronal membranes by modulating voltage-gated sodium channels, inhibiting the repetitive firing of action potentials and limiting the spread of seizure activity.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:** Diphenylhydantoin.
- **Brand Names:** Dilantin, Phenytek.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Phenytoin exerts its anticonvulsant effect by reducing the sustained high-frequency repetitive firing of action potentials in neurons by promoting sodium efflux from neurons. It selectively binds to the inactive state of voltage-gated sodium channels, prolonging their inactivation and reducing neuronal excitability. It does not appear to have a direct effect on GABAergic neurotransmission.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Phenytoin is well-absorbed orally, but the rate varies depending on the formulation (prompt-release, extended-release, or suspension). Intravenous administration achieves rapid therapeutic levels.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 enzymes, with a small contribution from CYP3A4.  Phenytoin exhibits saturable metabolism, leading to non-linear pharmacokinetics. Small dose increases can result in disproportionately large increases in serum concentrations.
    - **Elimination:** Mainly through hepatic metabolism, with a small portion excreted unchanged in the urine. The elimination half-life is variable (10-30 hours) and dose-dependent.
- **Mode of Action:**  Phenytoin binds preferentially to the inactivated state of voltage-gated sodium channels, prolonging their inactivation and reducing the ability of neurons to fire repetitive action potentials.  This action decreases seizure activity.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Phenytoin primarily interacts with voltage-gated sodium channels.  It does not significantly bind to GABA receptors or other neurotransmitter receptors.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism via CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 enzymes, followed by renal excretion of metabolites.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Initial Dose (phenytoin-naive):** 100 mg orally three times a day.
- **Maintenance Dose:** 300-400 mg/day, adjusted according to serum levels and clinical response. Maximum: 600 mg/day.  Extended-release capsules can be used for once-daily dosing in some patients after stabilization on divided doses.
- **Administration:** Oral or intravenous. IV infusion should not exceed 50 mg/minute.

#### **Children:**

- **Initial Dose:** 5 mg/kg/day orally in two to three divided doses.
- **Maintenance Dose:** 4-8 mg/kg/day, not to exceed 300 mg/day. Higher doses (8-10 mg/kg/day) may be necessary for infants and young children.
- **Pediatric Safety:** Monitor closely for adverse effects.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Lower initial and maintenance doses may be required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Monitor closely; dosage adjustment may be necessary based on serum concentrations and clinical response. Free phenytoin levels may be more informative in these patients.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Reduced dosage is required due to decreased metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring and dosage adjustment are necessary.

### **Clinical Use Cases:**

- **Intubation:** Phenytoin may be used for seizure prophylaxis in intubated patients, especially those with a history of seizures or at high risk for developing seizures.
- **Surgical Procedures (Neurosurgery):** Prophylaxis and treatment: 100-200 mg every 4 hours during and for 48-72 hours after neurosurgery, followed by adjustment to maintenance dose based on serum levels.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:**  Serum phenytoin levels can vary significantly in mechanically ventilated patients, and careful monitoring is essential.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Phenytoin levels should be monitored closely, as critically ill patients can have unpredictable drug metabolism. IV loading dose: 15-20 mg/kg, followed by 3-7 mg/kg/day maintenance. Consider PEEP interaction.
- **Emergency Situations (Status Epilepticus):** Loading dose: 15-20 mg/kg (adults) or 18 mg/kg (Walton Centre guidelines) IV at a rate not exceeding 50 mg/minute. Maintenance: 100 mg IV or orally every 6-8 hours. Pediatric loading dose: 15-20 mg/kg IV at 1-3 mg/kg/min (max 50 mg/min).

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- Close monitoring of serum phenytoin levels is essential, especially after dosage changes, and dose adjustments should be made in small increments (25-50 mg).
- Consider renal/hepatic function, albumin levels, concomitant medications, and other patient-specific factors.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Nystagmus, ataxia, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, nausea, vomiting, gingival hyperplasia, rash, and hirsutism.
