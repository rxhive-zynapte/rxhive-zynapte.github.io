## **Usage**

- Phospholipids are primarily used as a nutritional supplement to support liver function. They are prescribed for conditions like chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis, fatty liver, and intoxication by hepatotoxic substances.  They may also be used to improve cognitive function, protect the digestive system, promote fat breakdown, and dissolve gallstones.  They are also being studied for potential use in ulcerative colitis.
- **Pharmacological classification**: Hepatoprotective agent, Liver therapy agent.
- **Mechanism of action**: Phospholipids are essential components of cell membranes. In liver conditions, they help regenerate damaged liver cells by incorporating themselves into the cell membranes of hepatocytes and stabilizing their structure. This promotes cell repair and improves liver function. They also enhance fat breakdown and inhibit collagen synthesis which helps to prevent liver fibrosis.  They are being studied for their potential in inhibiting lipid peroxidation.

## **Alternate Names**

- Essential phospholipids
- EPL substance
- Polyenylphosphatidylcholine
- Phosphatidylcholine
- Lecithin

- **Brand names**: Essentiale Forte P, Essentiale Liver Health, Livertiale


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Phospholipids integrate into the liver cell membranes, restoring their structure and function. They also increase membrane fluidity, enhance enzyme activity, and improve cellular metabolism, improving overall liver function and reducing symptoms associated with liver diseases. They may also have an effect on phospholipase A1 and A2 activity in the brain. They might also play a role in modulating neurotransmitter activity.
- **Pharmacokinetics**:
    - **Absorption**: Orally administered phospholipids are absorbed in the small intestine.  Absorption may be improved when taken with food.
    - **Metabolism**:  Phospholipids are metabolized in the liver.
    - **Elimination**: Primarily eliminated through hepatic excretion, some renal excretion may occur.
- **Mode of action**: Phospholipids are incorporated into the cell membranes, particularly in hepatocytes. Their amphipathic nature (having both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts) allows them to repair and stabilize damaged cell membranes.  This also affects membrane fluidity and protein function within the membrane. This contributes to liver regeneration and restoration of normal function.
- **Receptor binding/enzyme inhibition/neurotransmitter modulation**: The primary mechanism is not related to specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation. However, research suggests a potential influence on phospholipase A1 and A2 activities and calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity, impacting neuronal membrane function.  Studies are also underway concerning inhibition of lipid peroxidation.
- **Elimination pathways**: Hepatic excretion, and some renal excretion.  Metabolism may occur via CYP enzymes.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults**:

- **Liver Health**: 2 capsules once daily.
- **Impaired Liver Function**: 2 capsules three times a day.
- **Maintenance Therapy**: 1-2 capsules twice daily.
- Other dosage recommendations include 840mg once to twice daily and 600mg twice daily.  In some cases, up to 1800mg daily divided into three doses is recommended. Up to 30 grams per day for up to 6 weeks, or up to 6 grams daily for up to 2 years may be considered.
- Capsules should be swallowed whole with water, preferably with food.

#### **Children**:

- Not recommended for children under 12 years of age due to insufficient information regarding safety and efficacy. For children over 12, the adult dosage applies.

#### **Special Cases**:

- **Patients with Renal Impairment**:  Exercise caution and monitor renal function.  Dosage adjustment based on clearance rate may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: No specific adjustments mentioned but careful monitoring of liver function is needed.  Start low and increase as tolerated.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Careful evaluation is required, particularly in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or those taking anticoagulants due to potential drug interactions.  Dose adjustment of anticoagulants may be necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Specific dosage recommendations for clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not explicitly mentioned.  Dosage should be determined based on the patient's specific condition and liver function.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose modifications should be made on a case-by-case basis considering patient-specific factors such as renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.
