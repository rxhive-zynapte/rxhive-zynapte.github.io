## **Usage**

Pidotimod is an immunostimulant used primarily as an adjunct treatment for recurrent infections of the respiratory tract, both upper (like rhinitis, sinusitis, tonsillitis, and the common cold) and lower (such as bronchitis and pneumonia). It is also utilized in treating acute respiratory infections and some immunological disorders.  It may be used in combination with other medications like antibiotics and antivirals in these conditions.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Immunostimulant

- **Mechanism of Action:** Pidotimod modulates the immune system, enhancing the body's natural defenses against bacterial and viral infections, particularly in the respiratory tract.  It activates and stimulates various components of the immune system like T-lymphocytes, increasing their activity.



## **Alternate Names**

No widely recognized alternate names exist for Pidotimod internationally.

- **Brand Names:**  Pidotimune, Maximune



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Pidotimod enhances both humoral and cellular immunity. It specifically promotes the maturation and activity of T-lymphocytes and other immune cells, improving the immune response against pathogens. It can also increase immunoglobulin production, boosting antibody response against infection-causing organisms.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Food can delay absorption and reduce bioavailability by up to 50%.  Peak plasma concentrations are reached in approximately 1.5-2 hours when taken without food.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted mainly through the kidneys. Elimination half-life can be prolonged in patients with renal impairment.

- **Mode of Action:** Pidotimod acts by modulating the activity of various immune cells, including T-lymphocytes, macrophages, and natural killer cells. This leads to an enhanced immune response against infections.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Acute Infections:** 800 mg twice daily (two 400 mg tablets or one 800 mg tablet) for 15-20 days.
- **Prophylaxis:**  800 mg once daily (two 400 mg tablets or one 800 mg tablet) for 60 days.
- **Administration:** Administer two hours before or after meals.


#### **Children (over 3 years of age):**

- **Acute Infections:** 400 mg twice daily for 15-20 days.
- **Prophylaxis:** 400 mg once daily for 60 days.
- **Administration:** Administer two hours before or after meals.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are generally recommended, but caution is advised in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduced dosage and monitoring are recommended. Elimination half-life is prolonged in these patients.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, and monitoring may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments may be needed based on individual patient conditions.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage adjustments in these clinical situations are based on the standard recommendations and should be individualized based on patient condition and severity of infection.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are based on individual patient conditions and should be made with caution.  Close monitoring is crucial in patients with renal and hepatic impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, skin rash, itching.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Hypersensitivity reactions (swelling, difficulty breathing, anaphylaxis), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Changes in liver enzyme levels (monitoring recommended with prolonged use).


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to pidotimod or any of its components.
- Autoimmune diseases (use with caution as it might exacerbate the condition).
- Pregnancy (especially first trimester).

- Certain antibiotics and antivirals: May enhance or inhibit pidotimod's action.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Not recommended, especially during the first trimester.  Insufficient data available on safety during pregnancy.
- **Breastfeeding:** Not recommended due to lack of information regarding drug excretion in breast milk.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Immunostimulant, enhances immune response, particularly in the respiratory tract.
- **Side Effects:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, itching (common); hypersensitivity reactions, liver enzyme changes (rare/long-term).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, autoimmune diseases, pregnancy, breastfeeding.
- **Drug Interactions:** Immunosuppressants, certain antibiotics and antivirals.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Not recommended.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 800 mg BID (acute), 800 mg OD (prophylaxis); Children: 400 mg BID (acute), 400 mg OD (prophylaxis).
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests (for long-term use).


## **Popular Combinations**

Often used in conjunction with standard therapies for respiratory infections, such as antibiotics or antivirals.


## **Precautions**

- Monitor liver function with long-term use.
- Use cautiously in patients with pre-existing medical conditions, especially renal or hepatic impairment.
- Consider age-specific recommendations.
