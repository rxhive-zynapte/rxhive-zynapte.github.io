## **Usage**

Pilocarpine is prescribed for the treatment of dry mouth (xerostomia) caused by radiation therapy for head and neck cancer or Sjögren's syndrome.  It is also used in ophthalmology to treat glaucoma and ocular hypertension.  Other ophthalmic uses include inducing miosis (pupil constriction) to reverse mydriasis (pupil dilation), treating presbyopia, and prior to or during some laser eye surgeries. Pilocarpine can also be used to induce status epilepticus in animal models of epilepsy.


Its pharmacological classification is a **cholinergic agonist** or **parasympathomimetic agent**, specifically a **muscarinic agonist**.

Pilocarpine's mechanism of action involves stimulating muscarinic receptors, mimicking the effects of acetylcholine.  This leads to increased secretions from exocrine glands, such as salivary, lacrimal, and sweat glands, resulting in increased salivation, tear production, and sweating, respectively.  In the eye, it causes miosis, ciliary muscle contraction, and increased aqueous humor outflow, which helps lower intraocular pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

Pilocarpine hydrochloride, pilocarpine nitrate.

Brand names include Salagen, Isopto Carpine, Pilocar, and Qlosi.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Pilocarpine acts as a non-selective muscarinic receptor agonist, binding to and activating M1, M2, and M3 receptors.  Stimulation of M3 receptors on salivary gland cells leads to increased saliva production. Similarly, stimulation of M3 receptors in the eye causes miosis, ciliary muscle contraction, and increased aqueous humor outflow.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Pilocarpine is well-absorbed orally.  Food can increase the absorption rate. Following ophthalmic administration, systemic absorption can occur, especially with higher concentrations.
* **Metabolism:** Pilocarpine is metabolized by pilocarpine esterase in the plasma and liver. The metabolites have negligible pharmacological activity.
* **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion, with a half-life of approximately 0.76-1.35 hours after oral administration and about 4 hours after ophthalmic administration.

**Mode of Action:** Pilocarpine binds directly to muscarinic receptors, triggering a cascade of intracellular events, including increased phosphoinositide turnover and calcium mobilization, leading to the physiological effects described above.

**Receptor Binding:** Pilocarpine is a non-selective muscarinic agonist, meaning it can bind to all subtypes of muscarinic receptors (M1-M5), but its clinical effects primarily result from M3 receptor activation.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Xerostomia:** 5 mg orally three or four times a day. The dose can be titrated up to 10 mg per dose, not exceeding 30 mg/day. For Sjögren's syndrome: 5 mg orally four times a day.
* **Glaucoma/Ocular Hypertension:**  1-2 drops of 1%, 2%, or 4% pilocarpine ophthalmic solution instilled in the affected eye(s) up to four times daily.
* **Presbyopia:** One drop of pilocarpine 1.25% ophthalmic solution daily in each eye.

#### **Children:**

* Use and dose must be determined by a doctor. Ophthalmic use of up to 2% pilocarpine appears to be safe in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Increased risk of mental status changes (psychosis, dementia). Start with lower doses and titrate cautiously.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution advised.  No specific dosage adjustments are available, but close monitoring is necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Mild impairment: No dosage adjustment necessary. Moderate impairment: 5 mg twice daily, then adjust based on response and tolerability. Severe impairment: Not recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution advised in patients with asthma, cardiovascular disease, peptic ulcer disease, urinary tract obstruction, and Parkinson's disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Intubation:** Not typically used for intubation in clinical practice.  Other neuromuscular blocking agents are preferred.
* **Surgical Procedures:** Used in ophthalmic surgery to induce miosis prior to procedures or during surgery for acute angle-closure glaucoma.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:**  Not typically used. Other agents are preferred for muscle relaxation during mechanical ventilation.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Limited role in the ICU setting.  May be used occasionally for the treatment of glaucoma.
* **Emergency Situations:**  Used in the emergency treatment of acute angle-closure glaucoma.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments may be needed based on patient-specific factors like renal/hepatic dysfunction and individual response to therapy.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Sweating, nausea, rhinitis, chills, flushing, urinary frequency, asthenia, headache, vision changes (blurred vision, myopia), eye irritation or pain (with ophthalmic use).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, pulmonary edema, acute angle closure glaucoma (especially in predisposed individuals), retinal detachment.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential for chronic complications like cataracts and visual field defects with long-term ophthalmic use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis require immediate intervention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to pilocarpine.
* Conditions where miosis is undesirable (e.g., acute iritis, anterior uveitis, some forms of secondary glaucoma).
* Uncontrolled asthma.
* Peptic ulcer disease.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Beta-blockers:** May potentiate bradycardia.
* **Cholinesterase inhibitors:** May enhance cholinergic effects.
* **Anticholinergic drugs:**  May antagonize the effects of pilocarpine.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pilocarpine is Pregnancy Category C. It should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  It is unknown if pilocarpine is excreted in human milk.  Caution should be exercised when administering to nursing mothers.
