## **Usage**

Pimavanserin is prescribed for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis.  It is pharmacologically classified as an atypical antipsychotic, specifically a selective serotonin inverse agonist and antagonist. The precise mechanism isn't fully understood, but it primarily acts by blocking serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors and, to a lesser extent, 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors in the brain. This targeted action helps reduce the occurrence of hallucinations and delusions without affecting dopaminergic pathways, which are crucial for managing Parkinson's disease motor symptoms.

## **Alternate Names**

Pimavanserin is marketed under the brand name Nuplazid. There are no widely recognized alternate names or international variations for the generic name.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Pimavanserin primarily exerts its antipsychotic effects through inverse agonism and antagonism at serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors, with some activity at 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors.  It does *not* bind significantly to dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors, distinguishing it from other atypical antipsychotics. This selectivity minimizes the risk of worsening motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease patients.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Pimavanserin is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations in about 6 hours. Food does not significantly affect absorption.
* **Metabolism:**  Primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4 enzymes. This makes it susceptible to drug interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers.
* **Elimination:**  Eliminated primarily through hepatic metabolism, with a half-life of approximately 57 hours. This allows for once-daily dosing. A small portion is excreted unchanged in urine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard dose is 34 mg orally once daily, without the need for titration. The medication can be taken as a whole capsule or the contents can be sprinkled on soft foods like applesauce or yogurt and consumed immediately.

#### **Children:**

The safety and efficacy of pimavanserin have not been established in pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is generally required for elderly patients. However, caution is advised due to increased risk of adverse effects, especially in those with dementia-related psychosis unrelated to Parkinson's disease.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for mild to moderate renal impairment. Caution is advised in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) or end-stage renal disease as pimavanserin exposure may be increased.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment is typically recommended, but caution is warranted.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Care should be taken in patients with QT prolongation or those taking other QT-prolonging medications. Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected before initiating therapy.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of pimavanserin is specifically indicated for Parkinson's disease psychosis. Its use in other clinical settings, such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations has not been established.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

* **Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** Reduce pimavanserin dose to 10 mg orally once daily.
* **Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers:** Avoid concomitant use.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Peripheral edema (swelling in the legs and ankles), nausea, confusion, constipation, gait disturbances, hallucinations (paradoxical worsening or new onset).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

QT prolongation,  hypersensitivity reactions (rash, urticaria, angioedema), falls, syncope.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

The long-term safety profile of pimavanserin is still being evaluated. Monitor for potential cardiovascular effects and any new or worsening psychiatric symptoms.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Angioedema, Torsades de Pointes (rare but potentially fatal).

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to pimavanserin, history of QT prolongation, concomitant use with other QT-prolonging medications,  congenital long QT syndrome, history of Torsades de Pointes, recent myocardial infarction,  uncorrected electrolyte imbalances, significant bradycardia, severe hepatic impairment.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:**  Ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir.  Reduce pimavanserin dose to 10 mg when co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.
* **CYP3A4 Inducers:** Rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John's wort. Avoid concomitant use.
* **QT Prolonging Drugs:** Amiodarone, quinidine, sotalol, thioridazine, ziprasidone.  Avoid concomitant use.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Category:  Not assigned.  There are limited data on pimavanserin use during pregnancy. Animal studies have not shown harm to the fetus, but human data are lacking.  Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks.

Breastfeeding: It is unknown if pimavanserin passes into breast milk.  Advise caution or consider alternative medications if breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> inverse agonist/antagonist.
* **Side Effects:** Peripheral edema, nausea, confusion, constipation.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, QT prolongation, concurrent use with QT prolonging drugs.
* **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers, QT prolonging drugs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Limited data, caution advised.
* **Dosage:** 34 mg orally once daily (adjust for CYP3A4 inhibitors).
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Electrocardiogram (ECG) for QT interval,  peripheral edema, mental status, gait.


## **Popular Combinations**

Pimavanserin is often used in conjunction with other medications for Parkinson's disease management, such as levodopa/carbidopa, dopamine agonists, and other symptomatic treatments.  No dosage adjustment of levodopa/carbidopa is required when co-administered with pimavanserin.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Monitor for cardiovascular effects, fall risk, and worsening psychosis.
* **Specific Populations:**  Caution in elderly, patients with severe renal impairment, and pregnant/breastfeeding women.
