## **Usage**

- Pimecrolimus is prescribed for the short-term and intermittent long-term treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (eczema) in non-immunocompromised patients, particularly when other topical treatments like corticosteroids are ineffective, not tolerated, or inadvisable.  It is typically considered a second-line treatment.  It can be used in adults and children aged 3 months and older.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Topical Calcineurin Inhibitor (TCI).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Pimecrolimus binds to macrophilin-12, creating a complex that inhibits calcineurin.  This inhibition blocks T-cell activation and reduces the release of inflammatory cytokines, thereby mitigating the inflammatory response associated with eczema.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:**  No significant variations.
- **Brand Names:** Elidel

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Pimecrolimus exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by selectively inhibiting calcineurin in T-lymphocytes and mast cells. This inhibition leads to decreased production and release of inflammatory cytokines, reducing inflammation and relieving itching associated with atopic dermatitis. Pimecrolimus also inhibits the release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Pimecrolimus exhibits minimal systemic absorption following topical application. The low systemic absorption minimizes the risk of systemic side effects.  Metabolism is primarily hepatic via CYP3A4 enzymes. Elimination pathways are not fully characterized but likely involve a combination of hepatic metabolism and excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** Binds with high affinity to macrophilin-12 (FKBP-12). The resulting pimecrolimus-FKBP12 complex inhibits calcineurin phosphatase, thus blocking signal transduction in T-cells and mast cells. This ultimately leads to the suppression of cytokine production (e.g., IL-2, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) and the subsequent reduction of inflammation.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition:** Binds to macrophilin-12 and inhibits calcineurin phosphatase activity.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism (CYP3A4), with a small amount possibly excreted unchanged.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Apply a thin layer of 1% pimecrolimus cream to the affected skin twice daily.
- Rub in gently and completely.

#### **Children (3 months and older):**

- Same as adult dosing:  Apply a thin layer of 1% pimecrolimus cream to the affected skin twice daily.
- Pediatric Safety Considerations: Avoid use in children younger than 3 months.  Monitor for any signs of skin infection.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments are generally not necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustments are indicated as systemic absorption is minimal. However, caution is recommended.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution as pimecrolimus is metabolized in the liver.  Dose adjustments may be necessary depending on the severity of hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor for potential drug interactions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Pimecrolimus is not systemically administered and is indicated only for topical application in atopic dermatitis. Therefore, it has no clinical use cases for scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Consider reducing the frequency of application or temporarily discontinuing use if significant irritation occurs.
- In cases of hepatic impairment, dose reduction may be warranted.

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Application site burning, stinging, or itching (usually mild and transient).
- Headache.
- Flu-like symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, cold symptoms).
- Swollen lymph nodes.
- Skin infections.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Potential increased risk of certain cancers (e.g., lymphoma, skin cancer).  Causality has not been definitively established.
- Allergic reactions (e.g., hives, angioedema).
- Impaired wound healing.


### **Long-Term Effects**

- Potential for skin discoloration (hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation).
- Long-term safety beyond one year of intermittent use is not fully established.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Anaphylaxis (rare).
- Severe application site reactions.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to pimecrolimus or any component of the formulation.
- Netherton's syndrome.
- Immunocompromised patients.
- Active skin infections (bacterial, viral, or fungal).
- Malignant or potentially malignant skin lesions.

## **Drug Interactions**

- CYP3A4 Inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, some calcium channel blockers): Concomitant use may increase pimecrolimus systemic exposure.
- Immunosuppressants: Avoid concomitant use.
- Alcohol: May cause facial flushing and skin irritation shortly after consumption.
- Vaccinations: Should be administered prior to starting pimecrolimus or at least 14 days after discontinuation (28 days for live vaccines).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C.
- Fetal risks:  While animal studies using topical application have not shown harm,  human data are limited. Pimecrolimus should be avoided during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk.
- Breastfeeding: Pimecrolimus is likely present in breast milk. Use with caution and avoid application to the breast area.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits calcineurin, leading to decreased production and release of inflammatory cytokines.
- **Side Effects:** Application site reactions, headache, flu-like symptoms, swollen lymph nodes, potential increased risk of certain cancers (causality not established).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, Netherton's syndrome, immunocompromised patients, active skin infections, malignant skin lesions.
- **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors, immunosuppressants, alcohol.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Avoid during pregnancy unless clearly needed. Use with caution during breastfeeding; avoid applying to breasts.
- **Dosage:** Apply a thin layer twice daily to affected areas.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor application site reactions, signs of skin infection, and potential systemic effects.

## **Popular Combinations**

Pimecrolimus is generally used as monotherapy. Combining it with other topical agents on the same area is not typically recommended, as it can increase the risk of local irritation or adverse effects. However, it can be used on different areas of the body alongside other topical treatments if deemed clinically necessary. Emollients are frequently used as adjunctive therapy to maintain skin hydration.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes. Do not use with occlusive dressings. Protect treated skin from sunlight.  Monitor for signs of skin infection.
- **Specific Populations:** Pregnant women (avoid unless clearly needed), breastfeeding mothers (use with caution, avoid applying to breasts), children (avoid use in children under 3 months).
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Limit sun exposure, avoid tanning beds, avoid excessive alcohol consumption.
