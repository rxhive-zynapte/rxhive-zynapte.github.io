## **Usage**

Pinaverium bromide is prescribed for the symptomatic treatment of:

*   Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), relieving pain, transit disorders (constipation and/or diarrhea), and intestinal discomfort (bloating).
*   Functional disturbances of the biliary tract, alleviating associated pain.
*   Preparation for a barium enema.

**Pharmacological classification**: Pinaverium bromide is classified as an antispasmodic agent, specifically a calcium antagonist.

**Mechanism of Action**: Pinaverium bromide acts by relaxing the smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal tract. It inhibits the influx of calcium ions into these muscle cells, reducing their contractility and thus alleviating spasms and pain.

## **Alternate Names**

*   **International Nonproprietary Name (INN)**: Pinaverium bromide.

*   **Brand names**: Dicetel, Eldicet, Pivertel.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics**: Pinaverium bromide selectively targets the smooth muscle of the gastrointestinal tract, primarily in the colon. By blocking calcium channels, it inhibits muscle contractions, reducing spasms and associated pain and discomfort. It has no significant anticholinergic or cardiovascular effects.

**Pharmacokinetics**:

*   **Absorption**: Rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations reached within an hour.
*   **Metabolism**: Extensively metabolized in the liver.
*   **Elimination**: Primarily eliminated in feces, with a small amount excreted in urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 1.5 hours.
*   **Bioavailability**: Low oral bioavailability (<1%).
*   **Plasma Protein Binding**: High (95-97%).

**Mode of Action**: Pinaverium bromide acts as a calcium antagonist, specifically blocking voltage-dependent calcium channels in the smooth muscle cells of the gastrointestinal tract. This inhibition of calcium influx reduces muscle contractility, leading to relaxation of the intestinal and biliary smooth muscles. It affects the colonic motor response to food and pharmacological stimuli, suggesting a role in managing IBS.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   Standard dose: 50 mg three times daily, taken with a glass of water during meals.
*   Maximum dose: 100 mg three times daily (300mg total daily dose). The dosage can be adjusted as needed to 2 tablets twice a day.
*   For barium enema preparation: 100 mg twice daily for three days prior to the procedure.


#### **Children:**

Pinaverium bromide is not recommended for use in children under 18 years, as its safety and efficacy have not been established. Limited data suggests a daily dose of 100-150mg for children between 5 and 15 years old, but due to the risk of esophageal lesions, further research needs to be done to establish effectiveness. This medication can damage the throat and should therefore not be administered to children without close monitoring and care.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients**: Dosage adjustment is not typically required. However, initiating treatment with the lower end of the dose range (50mg three times per day) is recommended. 
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment**: No specific dosage adjustment guidelines are available. Close monitoring and dose adjustment based on clinical response are advised.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**:  No specific dosage adjustment guidelines are available. Close monitoring and dose adjustment based on clinical response are advised.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: No specific recommendations for other comorbidities. Careful consideration is necessary, particularly if interacting medications are used.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

*  Pinaverium bromide is not indicated for use in situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with renal or hepatic impairment based on individual patient response and clinical assessment. 

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   Gastrointestinal: Nausea, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain/fullness, heartburn, distension.
*   Other: Headache, dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, skin allergy (rash, pruritus, urticaria, erythema).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   Esophageal lesions (ulcers, strictures) if the medication is not swallowed properly.
*   Hypersensitivity reactions: Angioedema, anaphylactic shock.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

No specific long-term adverse effects have been reported.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

*   Esophageal lesions require immediate attention if suspected, potentially leading to dysphagia and pain.
*   Hypersensitivity reactions mandate immediate medical intervention.


## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to pinaverium bromide or any of its excipients.
*   Intestinal obstruction or severe motility disorders.
*   Pre-existing esophageal lesions or hiatus hernia (use with caution).
*   Galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption (due to the presence of lactose in the formulation).

## **Drug Interactions**

While clinical trials haven't revealed significant interactions with cardiac glycosides, oral antidiabetics, insulin, oral anticoagulants (e.g., acenocoumarol), or heparin, caution is advised.
Concomitant use with anticholinergics may enhance the spasmolytic effect.
Interactions with specific drugs require attention:

*   **CYP450 interactions**:  Although not explicitly documented, metabolism by CYP enzymes is possible, and interactions with inducers or inhibitors may occur. This warrants careful consideration when prescribing with drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes.
*   Numerous potential drug interactions have been suggested but not fully established. Consider interactions with other medications that prolong the QT interval or affect potassium levels, as these could be aggravated.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

*   **Pregnancy**:  Pinaverium bromide should be used during pregnancy only if clearly necessary, due to limited data on human safety. It has shown decreased gravidity performance in animal studies at high doses. Its use at the end of pregnancy may theoretically affect the newborn neurologically (hypotony, sedation).
*   **Breastfeeding**: Not recommended as it's unknown whether the drug is excreted in breast milk, and a risk to the nursing infant cannot be excluded.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action**: Calcium antagonist, relaxing gastrointestinal smooth muscle.
*   **Side Effects**: Nausea, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, drowsiness, esophageal lesions (rare).
*   **Contraindications**: Hypersensitivity, intestinal obstruction, pre-existing esophageal lesions, galactose intolerance.
*   **Drug Interactions**: Potentially with QT prolonging drugs and CYP450 substrates. Closely monitor.  Limited data regarding its effects on other drugs may suggest that it is safe to use with medications that would otherwise interfere with other medications.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding**: Use with caution in pregnancy if essential; avoid during breastfeeding.
*   **Dosage**: Adults: 50 mg three times daily, up to 100 mg three times daily. Not recommended for children.
*   **Monitoring Parameters**: Monitor for gastrointestinal side effects and esophageal symptoms. Assess for drug interactions based on concomitant medications.

## **Popular Combinations**

Pinaverium bromide is sometimes combined with other medications for IBS and biliary disorders, including anticholinergics.
Limited data are available, and the safety and efficacy should be assessed.

## **Precautions**

*   **General Precautions:** Screen patients for hypersensitivity, pre-existing esophageal lesions, and metabolic disorders affecting lactose absorption.
*   **Specific Populations:**
    *   Pregnant women: Carefully assess risks and benefits, consider alternatives.
    *   Breastfeeding mothers: Avoid use.
    *   Children:  Not recommended.
*   **Lifestyle Considerations:** Limit alcohol consumption. Advise patients about potential drowsiness and its impact on driving.
