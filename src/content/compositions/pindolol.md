      **A:**  For hypertension, the initial dose is 5 mg twice daily, titratable
      up to 60 mg/day. For angina, the initial dose is 5 mg three times a day,
      titratable up to 40 mg/day.  Dosages may need adjustments based on
      patient-specific factors, particularly in the elderly or those with
      hepatic or renal impairment.

## **Usage**

- Pindolol is prescribed for the management of hypertension (high blood pressure) and the prophylaxis (prevention) of angina pectoris (chest pain). It is also sometimes used off-label for chronic stable angina.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Non-selective beta-adrenergic blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Pindolol blocks the effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine on beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart and blood vessels. This reduces heart rate, myocardial contractility, and peripheral vascular resistance, thereby lowering blood pressure. The ISA partially counteracts these effects, leading to a less pronounced decrease in heart rate and cardiac output compared to pure beta-blockers.

## **Alternate Names**

-  No commonly used alternate names.
- **Brand Names:** Visken.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Pindolol reduces heart rate, cardiac output, and peripheral vascular resistance, leading to lower blood pressure.  It also decreases myocardial oxygen demand, which helps prevent angina. The intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) of pindolol partially offsets the bradycardic and negative inotropic effects of beta-blockade.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Pindolol is well-absorbed orally, with peak plasma concentrations reached in 1-3 hours. It is extensively metabolized by the liver, with a half-life of 3-4 hours in healthy individuals, which may increase in the elderly or those with renal impairment. Pindolol is excreted primarily through the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:** Pindolol competitively binds to beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors, blocking the binding of catecholamines.  This inhibits the activation of adenylate cyclase and the subsequent production of cyclic AMP, leading to the observed cardiovascular effects.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Pindolol competitively binds to beta-adrenergic receptors.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion with some hepatic metabolism.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Hypertension:** Initial dose is 5 mg twice daily, taken with or without food. The dose can be increased by 10 mg/day every 3-4 weeks up to a maximum of 60 mg/day. Doses greater than 30 mg/day should be divided into three daily doses.
- **Angina Pectoris:** Initial dose is 5 mg three times a day, taken with meals.  The dose can be increased up to a maximum of 40 mg/day.

#### **Children:**

- The safety and efficacy of pindolol have not been established in children.  Use is not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose (e.g., 5 mg twice daily) and titrate cautiously.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised; dose reduction may be necessary in severe impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised; dose reduction may be necessary in severe impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is necessary for patients with diabetes, as pindolol can mask symptoms of hypoglycemia.  Caution is also advised in patients with respiratory conditions like asthma or COPD, as pindolol can worsen bronchospasm.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Pindolol is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Other beta-blockers without ISA may be preferred in these settings.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on patient response and tolerance, as well as renal or hepatic function.  Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism are not routinely considered for pindolol dosage adjustments.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Dizziness, lightheadedness, drowsiness, fatigue, nausea, sleep disturbances, vivid dreams, decreased libido.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Bradycardia, hypotension, heart failure exacerbation, bronchospasm, dyspnea, allergic reactions, masked hypoglycemia.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Potential for worsening of pre-existing heart failure with long-term use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Severe bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis.

## **Contraindications**

- Bronchial asthma, severe bradycardia, second or third-degree heart block, cardiogenic shock, overt cardiac failure, hypersensitivity to pindolol.  Concomitant use with thioridazine is also contraindicated.

## **Drug Interactions**

- **Clinically Significant Drug Interactions:**  Other beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, antihypertensives, digoxin, insulin, thioridazine, reserpine, some antidepressants (e.g. TCAs).
- **CYP450 Interactions:**  No significant CYP450 interactions.
- **Interactions with Commonly Prescribed Medications:**  See above.
- **Over-the-Counter (OTC) drugs and Supplements:** Cold medicines, diet pills, and some herbal supplements may interact.
- **Food and Lifestyle Factors:**  No significant interactions with food. Alcohol can potentiate the hypotensive effects of pindolol. Smoking may decrease the effectiveness of pindolol.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  B (US FDA). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Use only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
- **Fetal Risks, Teratogenicity, and Developmental Concerns:** No known teratogenic effects, but potential for fetal bradycardia and growth restriction.
- **Drug Excretion in Breast Milk and Potential Neonatal Side Effects:** Pindolol is excreted in breast milk at low levels.  Monitor breastfed infants for bradycardia and hypoglycemia.  Consider safer alternatives.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Non-selective beta-blocker with ISA.
- **Side Effects:** Dizziness, fatigue, nausea, bradycardia, hypotension.
- **Contraindications:** Asthma, heart block, heart failure, bradycardia.
- **Drug Interactions:** Other beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, thioridazine.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; monitor infant.
- **Dosage:** Hypertension: 5-60 mg/day; Angina: 15-40 mg/day.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, heart rate, ECG, blood glucose (in diabetics).

## **Popular Combinations**

- Pindolol is often combined with thiazide diuretics for synergistic antihypertensive effects.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Monitor heart rate and blood pressure. Assess for respiratory conditions before starting therapy. Monitor diabetics for signs of hypoglycemia.  
- **Specific Populations:** See "Special Cases" under Dosage.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Limit alcohol intake. Advise patients about potential dizziness and fatigue and to avoid driving or operating machinery if affected.
