## **Usage**

- Pine bark extract is primarily used for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It's studied for various conditions, including asthma, ADHD, chronic venous insufficiency, cardiovascular issues, diabetes, erectile dysfunction, osteoarthritis, retinopathy, dysmenorrhea, and endometriosis.  However, strong clinical evidence supporting its efficacy for all these conditions is still limited.  It has shown promise for improving some symptoms of osteoarthritis and chronic venous insufficiency.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Pine bark extract isn't easily categorized into a single pharmacological class.  It acts as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory agent, and can influence vascular tone, placing it within a broader category of "herbal/botanical supplements" or "phytomedicines."
- **Mechanism of Action:** Pine bark extract's mechanism of action is multifaceted and primarily relates to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. The procyanidins within the extract scavenge free radicals, inhibiting oxidative stress and reducing inflammation by modulating inflammatory mediators like cytokines and prostaglandins.  It can also impact nitric oxide production, influencing vascular health.

## **Alternate Names**

- Pycnogenol (a specific, standardized brand name), Enzogenol, Maritime pine, Maritime pine extract, Monterey pine extract.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Pine bark extract exerts its effects by scavenging free radicals, inhibiting inflammatory mediators, and potentially modulating nitric oxide pathways. This leads to reduced oxidative stress, inflammation, and improved vascular function.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Pine bark extract is readily absorbed orally. The procyanidins are metabolized and eliminated through both renal and hepatic pathways, though the specific metabolic pathways are not fully elucidated.
- **Mode of Action:**  The procyanidins act as potent antioxidants, neutralizing free radicals and preventing oxidative damage. They also inhibit the production and activity of inflammatory mediators, thereby reducing inflammation.  Additionally, they may influence nitric oxide synthesis, leading to vasodilation and improved blood flow.  
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Specific receptor binding or neurotransmitter modulation hasn't been definitively identified.  The extract's primary activity involves enzyme inhibition related to inflammation (e.g., cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase).

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The usual adult dosage ranges from 50 mg to 450 mg per day, often divided into 2-3 doses. Doses used in clinical trials vary widely (20 mg to 360 mg/day) depending on the condition being treated. Long-term use up to one year has been reported in some studies. 

#### **Children:**

- Limited data supports the use of pine bark extract in children aged 6-18 years for up to three months. Pediatric dosing guidelines aren't well-established and should be carefully determined in consultation with a pediatrician. For ADHD, a dose of 1 mg/kg/day has been used in studies.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and adjust as needed, monitoring for potential adverse effects. Insufficient data exists for specific recommendations.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary; however, specific recommendations are lacking. Careful monitoring is advised.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, and dose adjustment may be necessary. Limited data exists for specific recommendations.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions (Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease, etc.):** Pine bark extract may lower blood sugar and blood pressure. Caution is advised for patients with diabetes or hypertension, and close monitoring of blood sugar and blood pressure is crucial.  Dose adjustment of concomitant medications may be necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- The use of Pine bark extract in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, and emergency situations isn't established, and there are no specific dosage recommendations for these contexts.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose modifications based on renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms haven't been definitively established due to insufficient research.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Gastrointestinal discomfort (nausea, stomach upset), dizziness, headache, irritability, low energy levels.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects**

-  Long-term effects are largely unknown. 


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Clinically significant ADRs are rare but can include severe allergic reactions.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to pine bark extract.  Caution is advised for individuals with autoimmune diseases as it may stimulate the immune system. Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding isn't well-studied and should be avoided due to insufficient safety data.

## **Drug Interactions**

- May interact with blood thinners (e.g., warfarin), diabetes medications (may lower blood sugar), immunosuppressants, and some cancer medications. Potential interactions with antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications exist.  Always consult with a healthcare provider regarding potential interactions with other medications, including OTC drugs and supplements. Interaction with food and lifestyle factors isn't well documented.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Insufficient data; avoid use due to potential risks.
- **Breastfeeding:** Insufficient data; avoid use.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, may influence vascular tone.
- **Side Effects:**  GI discomfort, dizziness, headache, irritability, low energy, allergic reactions (rare).
- **Contraindications:**  Hypersensitivity, caution in auto-immune diseases, avoid during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
- **Drug Interactions:** Blood thinners, diabetes medications, immunosuppressants, some cancer medications.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid.
- **Dosage:** Varies greatly depending on the condition (20 mg - 450 mg/day in adults).
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Blood sugar and blood pressure, especially in patients with diabetes or hypertension.


## **Popular Combinations**

-  Pine bark extract is sometimes combined with L-arginine for potential synergistic effects on endothelial function and erectile dysfunction.  However, clinical evidence is still limited.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Assess for allergies and pre-existing conditions, especially diabetes, hypertension, and autoimmune diseases.
- **Specific Populations:** Avoid use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Limited safety data in children and the elderly; use with caution. 
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Limited data regarding interactions with alcohol, smoking, and diet.
