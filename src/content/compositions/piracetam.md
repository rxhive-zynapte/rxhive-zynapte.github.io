## **Usage**

Piracetam is prescribed as an adjunct therapy for cortical myoclonus. It's also used in some European countries for cognitive impairment related to aging, including dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  It is investigated for potential benefits in conditions like dyslexia, vertigo, and brain injury, although evidence for these uses is less robust.  It has also been used to treat sickle-cell vaso-occlusive crises.  It's important to note that piracetam's efficacy varies, and it's not universally recognized as a first-line treatment for all these conditions. In the United States, piracetam is not approved for use in drugs or dietary supplements.

Piracetam is classified as a nootropic agent.  Nootropics are a class of substances that are believed to enhance cognitive function.

Piracetam's mechanism of action isn't fully understood. It appears to modulate neuronal membrane fluidity and improve cerebral blood flow, potentially enhancing brain metabolism and neuronal function.  Additionally, it might impact neurotransmitter systems, influencing neuronal excitability. It has a GABA-mimetic action, and influences glutamate receptors.  These effects may contribute to improved cognitive performance in certain conditions.

## **Alternate Names**

Piracetam is also known as Nootropil, Lucetam, Memotopril, Pyracetam, Pyrrolidone acetamide, 2-Oxo-1-pyrrolidine,  UCB6215. When combined with cinnarizine, it's marketed as Fezam.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Piracetam's exact effects on the body are still under investigation. It is thought to enhance cerebral blood flow and improve neuronal membrane fluidity. It might also influence neurotransmitter systems, particularly affecting neuronal excitability. These actions could contribute to improved cognitive function, especially in conditions like age-related cognitive decline.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Piracetam is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1-2 hours. It is not extensively metabolized by the liver. It is primarily excreted unchanged through renal filtration, with a half-life of 4-5 hours.  Dose adjustments are crucial in patients with renal impairment.

**Mode of Action:**  At the cellular level, piracetam is hypothesized to influence membrane fluidity, possibly by interacting with phospholipids.  This could impact neuronal receptor function and neurotransmission.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Piracetam's actions on specific receptors or enzymes are not fully characterized.  It is understood that piracetam can interact with glutamate receptors, and affects GABA. It does not interact directly with GABA receptors, and how piracetam functions is not fully known.

**Elimination Pathways:** Piracetam is predominantly eliminated via renal excretion, with minimal hepatic metabolism.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
The typical adult dosage ranges from 2.4 g to 4.8 g per day, administered orally in 2-3 divided doses.  For severe symptoms, higher doses up to 12 g/day might be necessary, often given intravenously.  For long-term treatment of psycho-organic syndromes in the elderly, doses range from 1.2 g to 2.4 g daily. A loading dose of up to 4.8 g/day may be used initially.

#### **Children:**
For children (8-13 years) with learning difficulties (specifically textual understanding), a dose of 3.2 g daily, divided into two doses, is often recommended. This should be used in conjunction with other appropriate measures like speech therapy. For sickle-cell vaso-occlusive crisis prophylaxis, a dosage of 160mg/kg can be used, and for crisis remission, 300mg/kg intravenously. Doses for younger children should be determined on a case-by-case basis by a physician, considering weight and the specific condition.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments based on renal function are crucial. Creatinine clearance should be regularly monitored to guide dosage.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is required based on creatinine clearance.  Specific dosing tables are available for guidance.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No dose adjustment is usually necessary for patients with *isolated* hepatic impairment. However, for patients with both hepatic and renal impairment, dose modification is recommended as per renal function.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Careful consideration is needed for patients with other conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, bleeding disorders, etc., due to potential drug interactions and side effects.  Patients on anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy should be monitored closely due to piracetam's potential to affect platelet aggregation.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing in these clinical settings needs to be individualized based on patient condition and should be determined by the treating physician:

- **Intubation:**  Not specifically indicated for intubation itself.

- **Surgical Procedures:**  Discontinue piracetam at least two weeks prior to surgery due to its potential antiplatelet effects.

- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not specifically indicated for mechanical ventilation itself.

- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Dosage will depend on the underlying condition being treated and renal function.  Intravenous administration is often preferred.

- **Emergency Situations:**  In emergencies like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest, piracetam is typically not the primary drug used.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments should be made according to renal function.  A dose reduction is necessary for patients with renal impairment, based on creatinine clearance.  No specific dose adjustments are usually required for patients with only hepatic dysfunction.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Commonly reported side effects include nervousness, anxiety, depression, drowsiness, weight gain, diarrhea, insomnia, hyperactivity, rash, dizziness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Rare but serious side effects might include severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), bleeding disorders, angioedema, and hallucinations.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term effects of piracetam are not fully characterized. Clinical trials have explored long-term use (up to 18 months) with doses up to 20 g/day, generally with good tolerability, though this should not be extrapolated to all patients. Ongoing monitoring is crucial during prolonged therapy.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Clinically significant ADRs requiring immediate medical intervention are rare but could include anaphylaxis, severe bleeding, and angioedema.



## **Contraindications**

Piracetam is contraindicated in patients with:

- Hypersensitivity to piracetam or other pyrrolidone derivatives.
- End-stage renal disease (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min).
- Cerebral hemorrhage.
- Huntington's disease.



## **Drug Interactions**

Piracetam might interact with:

- **Anticoagulants/Antiplatelet drugs (e.g., warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel):**  Increased risk of bleeding and bruising.
- **Thyroid hormones (e.g., levothyroxine):** May cause confusion, irritability, and sleep disturbances.
- **Alcohol:** While no direct pharmacokinetic interaction is known, caution is advised.

Other potential interactions exist with medications like cilostazol, dipyridamole, eptifibatide, prasugrel, ticlopidine, and tirofiban. It is important to review all concomitant medications with a healthcare professional before initiating Piracetam.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Piracetam is contraindicated during pregnancy unless clearly necessary and the benefits outweigh the risks. Piracetam crosses the placenta, reaching significant levels in the fetus.  

Piracetam is excreted in breast milk and is therefore contraindicated during breastfeeding.  Breastfeeding should be discontinued while on piracetam.
