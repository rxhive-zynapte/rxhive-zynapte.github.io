## **Usage**

- Piribedil is prescribed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, both as monotherapy and as adjunct therapy with levodopa. It is particularly beneficial in cases with prominent tremor.  It is also used to treat cognitive impairment in the elderly, dizziness, and intermittent claudication due to peripheral arterial occlusive disease (stage II).
- **Pharmacological Classification**: Dopamine agonist, α₂-adrenergic antagonist.
- **Mechanism of Action**: Piribedil acts primarily as a dopamine agonist, stimulating D₂ and D₃ receptors in the brain.  This action helps to compensate for dopamine deficiency, a key factor in Parkinson's disease. Its α₂-adrenergic antagonist properties may contribute to improved cerebral blood flow and cognitive function.

## **Alternate Names**

- Pronoran, Trivastal, Trastal, Trivastal LP, Trivastan ritardo.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Piribedil primarily stimulates D₂ and D₃ dopamine receptors, improving motor symptoms and cognitive function. Its α₂-adrenergic antagonism may contribute to vasodilation.
- **Pharmacokinetics**:  Piribedil is administered orally and is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract.  Food may enhance its absorption.  Peak plasma concentration is generally reached in about one hour. It has low bioavailability (approximately 10%).
- **Mode of Action**: Binds to and activates D₂ and D₃ dopamine receptors, mimicking the effects of dopamine. It also blocks α₂-adrenergic receptors.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation**: D₂ and D₃ receptor agonist; α₂-adrenergic receptor antagonist.
- **Elimination Pathways**: Although specific details were not found in the provided resources, the primary metabolic pathway is not hepatic. Limited available information suggests it is not cleared through CYP enzymes. Further investigation is needed to provide precise details.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Monotherapy**: 150-250 mg daily, divided into 3-5 doses.
- **Adjunctive Therapy with Levodopa**: 50-150 mg daily (approximately 20 mg of piribedil per 100 mg of levodopa), divided into multiple doses. It is advised to commence at 50 mg daily, escalating by 50 mg every three days until the desired effect is observed.
- Administer with food.

#### **Children:**

The safety and efficacy of piribedil in children under 18 have not been established and its use is not recommended.
