## **Usage**

Piroctone Olamine is primarily prescribed for the treatment and prevention of fungal infections, particularly those affecting the skin and scalp. It's classified as an antifungal agent.  It's highly effective against *Malassezia* species, the fungi often responsible for dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, and some types of acne.  It also exhibits some antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.

## **Alternate Names**

Piroctone Olamine is also known as Octopirox. Brand names include Noskurf and Climdan, among others.  Many products incorporate Piroctone Olamine without specifically highlighting it in the brand name.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Piroctone Olamine disrupts fungal cell membranes, interfering with energy metabolism and oxygen uptake. This leads to fungal cell death.  It also has some effect on sebum regulation, which contributes to its efficacy in dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Primarily topical application; systemic absorption is minimal. Information on its metabolism and elimination is limited due to its topical use.  It's believed to be well-tolerated by most skin types.

**Mode of Action:** Piroctone Olamine penetrates the fungal cell wall and forms complexes with iron, inhibiting fungal energy metabolism and leading to cell death.  It may also have some inhibitory effects on certain bacterial species.

## **Dosage**

Piroctone Olamine is typically applied topically.  Dosage depends on the specific product and its concentration. Always follow product instructions.


### **Standard Dosage**
