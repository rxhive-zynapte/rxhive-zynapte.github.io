      Can Piroxicam be used for acute pain management?**


      **A:** While piroxicam possesses analgesic properties, due to its long

      conditions like post-operative or acute musculoskeletal pain.  Other

## **Usage**

Piroxicam is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (including juvenile rheumatoid arthritis), and ankylosing spondylitis. It is also used to treat acute musculoskeletal disorders, acute gout, post-operative and post-traumatic pain, primary dysmenorrhea, and for the relief of fever and pain associated with acute upper respiratory tract inflammation.  It's classified pharmacologically as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).  Piroxicam works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2), enzymes responsible for prostaglandin synthesis. By reducing prostaglandins, piroxicam decreases inflammation and pain.

## **Alternate Names**

Piroxicam is also known by various brand names such as Feldene, Feldene Flash among others. There aren't widely used alternate generic names.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Piroxicam exerts its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects primarily through the inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. This leads to a decrease in prostaglandin synthesis, which are mediators of inflammation, pain, and fever.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Piroxicam is well-absorbed orally. Taking it with food may slightly delay absorption but does not affect the overall extent of absorption.
* **Metabolism:** Piroxicam is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2C9, to inactive metabolites. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2C9 can affect piroxicam metabolism and clearance.
* **Elimination:** Piroxicam is primarily eliminated via renal excretion of its metabolites, with a small portion excreted in the feces.  It has a long half-life of approximately 50 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing.

**Mode of Action:** Piroxicam binds to and inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. This inhibition prevents the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2, a precursor to various prostaglandins involved in inflammation and pain.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard dosage for adults is 20 mg orally once daily or 10 mg twice daily. The maximum daily dose is generally 20mg, though in some cases, up to 30 mg may be used for short periods with careful monitoring for side effects.  It should always be taken with food or a full glass of water to minimize gastrointestinal side effects.

#### **Children:**

Piroxicam use in children younger than 18 years is generally not recommended. For Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis: Dosage is determined by body weight:<15 kg: 5 mg/day; 16-25 kg: 10 mg/day; 26-45 kg: 15 mg/day; >45 kg: 20 mg/day. 

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Initiate therapy at the lower end of the dosing range (e.g., 10 mg daily) and monitor closely for adverse events.  Due to age-related decreases in renal and hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** A lower dose should be considered and patients should be carefully monitored.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Close monitoring is recommended, and dosage adjustments may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Close monitoring is recommended, especially for patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, or a history of gastrointestinal bleeding.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Piroxicam is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations requiring rapid onset of action.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on patient-specific factors such as renal or hepatic impairment, age, and concomitant medications. 

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Diarrhea, dizziness, headache, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, abdominal pain, edema, anemia, constipation, vomiting, fever.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration, perforation, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), kidney failure, liver failure, heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic kidney disease, gastrointestinal complications (e.g., ulcers, bleeding), cardiovascular events (e.g., heart attack, stroke).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any serious side effects mentioned above should be considered as potential ADRs requiring immediate medical intervention.

## **Contraindications**

Absolute contraindications include:  Hypersensitivity to piroxicam or any other NSAID, including aspirin; history of asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reaction after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs, active peptic ulcer, recent gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, severe heart failure, severe hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, third trimester of pregnancy, perioperative pain in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

Relative contraindications include:  history of peptic ulcer disease, gastrointestinal bleeding,  inflammatory bowel disease,  bleeding disorders,  asthma,  cardiovascular disease,  hypertension, renal impairment, hepatic impairment,  elderly patients.

## **Drug Interactions**

Piroxicam can interact with numerous medications, including:

* **NSAIDs, aspirin:** Increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects.
* **Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin):** Increased risk of bleeding.
* **Antihypertensives (e.g., ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, diuretics):** Decreased antihypertensive effect.
* **Methotrexate:** Increased methotrexate toxicity.
* **Lithium:** Increased lithium levels.
* **Corticosteroids:** Increased risk of gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding.
* **CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole):** Increased piroxicam levels.
* **Alcohol:** Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Piroxicam is contraindicated during the third trimester of pregnancy due to the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and other potential fetal complications. It should be avoided during the first and second trimesters unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Piroxicam is excreted in breast milk and may cause adverse effects in nursing infants. Breastfeeding is generally not recommended while taking piroxicam.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits COX-1 and COX-2, reducing prostaglandin synthesis.
* **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, dizziness, headache, heartburn, GI bleeding, ulceration.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to NSAIDs, third-trimester pregnancy.
* **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, antihypertensives, methotrexate.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in third trimester; avoid breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** 20 mg once daily or 10 mg twice daily (max 20-30 mg/day).
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, liver function, blood pressure, signs of GI bleeding.

## **Popular Combinations**

Piroxicam is not typically used in combination with other NSAIDs.  Gastroprotective agents (e.g., proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol) may be co-prescribed to reduce the risk of GI side effects.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess for allergies, renal/hepatic function, cardiovascular risks.
* **Specific Populations:** As detailed above.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Limit alcohol, avoid driving if dizziness occurs.
