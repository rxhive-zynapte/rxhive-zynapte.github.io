## **Usage**

Human placental extract is primarily used in dermatological preparations for treating chronic non-healing wounds, delayed wound healing (especially in diabetic patients), burns, chronic ulcers, and other skin defects. It also purportedly has various other uses, including treating infertility, menopausal symptoms, fatigue, and as a general health tonic, but supporting clinical evidence for these applications is limited and inconsistent. Some research suggests its potential use for nerve regeneration and inflammation reduction, although this remains an area of active investigation.

It does not fit neatly into a single pharmacological classification but exhibits various properties, including wound healing promotion, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and potentially regenerative effects.

Its mechanism of action involves decreasing inflammation, increasing blood supply to the wound area, stimulating cell growth, and promoting collagen synthesis, thus facilitating tissue regeneration and faster wound healing.

## **Alternate Names**

Placenta extract (human), human placental extract (HPE), Laennec (brand name), Melsmon (brand name), Placentrex (brand name).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Placenta extract promotes wound healing through various mechanisms. It reduces inflammation, possibly through modulation of cytokines and growth factors. It enhances blood supply to the affected area, thereby increasing oxygen and nutrient delivery, which is vital for tissue repair.  Furthermore, it stimulates cell growth and proliferation, accelerating the regeneration process. Lastly, it promotes collagen synthesis, a crucial structural protein for wound closure and scar formation.

**Pharmacokinetics:** While the specific pharmacokinetics of placental extract haven't been fully elucidated due to the complexity of its composition, evidence suggests its topical application facilitates localized action within the applied area. The presence of various growth factors, cytokines, and other bioactive molecules likely contributes to its therapeutic effect at the wound site. For injectable forms, subcutaneous or intramuscular administration may allow systemic distribution and potential effects on various tissues and organs, although the specifics are not clearly documented in the provided sources.

**Mode of Action:** The precise cellular and molecular mechanisms remain partially unclear due to the multitude of components in placenta extract. Proposed mechanisms include stimulating fibroblast activity for collagen production, promoting angiogenesis (blood vessel formation) via growth factors, modulating inflammatory mediators to reduce inflammation, and influencing immune responses potentially through immunomodulatory factors present in the extract.  Specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation details have not been detailed in the available sources, suggesting that these mechanisms are not yet precisely defined or may not play a primary role in its action. Elimination pathways after injection are not clearly identified but may involve both renal and hepatic routes.

## **Dosage**

Dosage and administration of placenta extracts vary widely depending on the formulation (injection, topical cream/gel, or oral capsules) and the specific clinical indication.  There isn't a universally standardized dosing regimen.

### **Standard Dosage**

The provided sources do not give conclusive or standard dosage information.

#### **Adults:**

For Laennec injections, a typical dose is 2 ml subcutaneously or intramuscularly once daily. For other injections, dosage recommendations range from 1-4 g daily, depending on the specific product. Oral dosages vary from 200-600 mg daily, depending on the preparation and the study. Topical application involves applying a thin layer to the affected area as directed by the physician.


#### **Children:**

Limited information is available regarding pediatric dosages, but generally, lower doses are recommended, and caution should be exercised.

#### **Special Cases:**

Dosage adjustments in special populations such as the elderly, patients with renal or hepatic impairment, or those with comorbid conditions are not well-defined and should be determined on a case-by-case basis considering patient-specific factors and clinical judgment.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations are not available within the supplied sources.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Specific dose modifications based on renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms are not clearly outlined in the provided sources.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Stinging and burning sensations at the application site (topical formulations), itching, rash, and nausea are among reported common side effects. Injection site reactions may occur.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic shock, although rare, have been reported. Pulmonary complications, like hypersensitivity pneumonitis, have also been described in isolated cases.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic complications from prolonged use are not well documented.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs requiring immediate attention include severe allergic reactions (skin rash, hives, difficulty breathing, drop in pulse), and pulmonary complications.

## **Contraindications**

Known allergies to placenta extract or any of its components constitute an absolute contraindication. Pre-existing medical conditions like mastitis and blocked milk ducts should be considered as relative contraindications, given the potential stimulatory effect of placenta extract on lactation.  Viral or bacterial infections in the mother may preclude use in products derived from human placenta.


## **Drug Interactions**

Limited and unclear information regarding drug interactions is available. Patients should inform their doctor about all medications they are taking to assess potential interactions.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of placenta extract during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not well established. Use during these periods is generally advised against or should be considered only if the potential benefits clearly outweigh the risks.  No FDA pregnancy safety category is assigned to placenta extracts.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

**Mechanism of Action:** Promotes wound healing by decreasing inflammation, increasing blood supply, stimulating cell growth, and enhancing collagen synthesis.

**Side Effects:** Stinging, burning, itching, rash, nausea, injection site reactions.  Rarely: severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), pulmonary complications.

**Contraindications:** Allergy to components, mastitis/blocked milk ducts (relative).

**Drug Interactions:** Limited information available.

**Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use not recommended unless potential benefit outweighs risk.

**Dosage:** Varies greatly depending on formulation and indication. Topical: applied as directed. Injections: vary from 1-4 g daily or 2 ml injection. Oral: 200-600 mg daily.

**Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for allergic reactions, especially with injections. For wound healing, assess wound closure rate, infection signs, and inflammation.

## **Popular Combinations**

Specific popular drug combinations aren't mentioned.

## **Precautions**

Pre-screening for allergies is essential. Caution is advised in patients with mastitis or blocked ducts. Assess for potential drug interactions. Careful consideration is needed for pregnant/breastfeeding individuals.
