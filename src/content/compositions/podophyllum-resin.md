## **Usage**

- Podophyllum resin is prescribed for the topical treatment of genital warts (Condyloma acuminata) caused by certain strains of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV).  It is also used for other benign skin growths like common warts, but less commonly so due to the availability of safer alternatives.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Topical keratolytic agent, antiviral.
- **Mechanism of action:** Podophyllum resin contains podophyllotoxin, which is a cytotoxic agent that inhibits cell division (mitosis) by binding to microtubules, thus disrupting cellular function and ultimately causing cell death. This leads to necrosis and sloughing off of the wart tissue.


## **Alternate Names**

- Podophyllin
- Podocon-25 (brand name)
- Podofin (brand name)
- Pododerm (brand name)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Podophyllum resin acts locally to destroy the wart tissue by inhibiting cell mitosis and causing cell death (necrosis). Systemic absorption can occur, particularly with higher doses or application to large areas, potentially leading to systemic toxicity.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Topical application of podophyllum resin results in limited percutaneous absorption. However, the extent of absorption can be influenced by the concentration used, the size of the area treated, and the duration of application.  The drug is metabolized in the liver and eliminated primarily through the kidneys.
- **Mode of action:** Podophyllotoxin binds to tubulin, a protein essential for cell division. This binding disrupts the formation of microtubules, which are essential for chromosome segregation during mitosis.  The disruption of mitosis prevents cell division and ultimately leads to cell death.
- **Elimination pathways:** While the primary route of elimination is renal, a certain amount is also likely eliminated via the biliary/fecal route. Precise details on metabolism and elimination are limited, but some metabolism by CYP enzymes is possible given that it is metabolized in the liver.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

A 10-25% solution of podophyllum resin in benzoin tincture is applied sparingly to each wart by a healthcare professional. The treatment area should not exceed 10 cm² and the total volume of solution should be <0.5 mL per session. Treatment may be repeated weekly for up to 6 weeks.  The resin should be left on for 1-4 hours and then washed off with soap and water.

#### **Children:**

Use in children is generally avoided due to the risk of systemic toxicity. If absolutely necessary, application should be under strict supervision of a physician, using the lowest effective concentration for the shortest duration possible.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Similar to adults, but monitor for systemic toxicity due to potentially reduced metabolic capacity and organ function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution and consider dose reduction due to potential accumulation of the drug or its metabolites.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution.  Dosage adjustment may be needed to account for potentially reduced metabolic capacity.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with extreme caution in patients with diabetes or circulatory problems due to increased risk of local adverse effects and potential systemic toxicity.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Podophyllum resin is typically not used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, the ICU, or emergency situations. Its use is confined to topical application for specific dermatological conditions.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments should be made based on individual patient factors such as age, the size and location of the warts, the patient's tolerance, and the presence of renal or hepatic impairment.  A lower concentration (e.g., 5%) may be considered for larger warts.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Local irritation (burning, stinging, pain, itching, redness, swelling) at the application site.
- Tenderness of the treated skin.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Severe local reactions (ulceration, necrosis, scarring).
- Systemic toxicity (confusion, drowsiness, seizures, coma, peripheral neuropathy, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia).


### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic complications from prolonged use are rare but can include scarring or changes in skin pigmentation.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Systemic toxicity.
- Allergic reactions (rash, hives, angioedema).

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to podophyllum resin or any of its components.
- Pregnancy.
- Breastfeeding.
- Open wounds or broken skin at the application site.
- Large or extensive genital warts.
- Bleeding warts.
- Moles, birthmarks.
- Use in children.
- Diabetes mellitus.
- Circulatory disorders.
- Concomitant use with corticosteroids.

## **Drug Interactions**

No significant drug interactions have been specifically documented. However, concurrent use with other topical medications in the same area should be avoided unless specifically directed by a physician.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** X (Contraindicated). Podophyllum resin is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of fetal harm, birth defects, stillbirth, and fetal death.
- **Breastfeeding:** Podophyllum resin is contraindicated during breastfeeding due to the unknown risk of transmission to the infant through breast milk.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Cytotoxic agent that inhibits mitosis, leading to cell death and destruction of wart tissue.
- **Side Effects:** Local irritation, rarely systemic toxicity.
- **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, breastfeeding, hypersensitivity, open wounds, diabetes, circulatory disorders.
- **Drug Interactions:** Limited documented interactions, but avoid concurrent use with other topical medications on the same area.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
- **Dosage:** 10-25% solution applied topically, not to exceed 0.5 mL or 10 cm² per session. Repeat weekly up to 6 weeks.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for local reactions and signs of systemic toxicity.

## **Popular Combinations**

Podophyllum resin is generally not used in combination with other drugs.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Apply cautiously to avoid contact with healthy skin. Protect surrounding skin with petroleum jelly. Use only on intact skin. Avoid contact with eyes, mucous membranes (urethra, anus, vagina, cervix, mouth).
- **Specific Populations:** See section on "Dosage - Special Cases."
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Patients should avoid smoking or being near open flames immediately after application as the resin is flammable.
