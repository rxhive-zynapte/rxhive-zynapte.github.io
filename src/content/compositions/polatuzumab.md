## **Usage**

Polatuzumab vedotin-piiq is a CD79b-directed antibody-drug conjugate indicated in combination with bendamustine and a rituximab product for the treatment of adult patients with:

* Relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, after at least two prior therapies.
* Previously untreated large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), including DLBCL not otherwise specified (NOS), high-grade B-cell lymphoma, Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV+) DLBCL NOS, and T-cell/histiocyte-rich LBCL (in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone [R-CHP]).

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antineoplastic agent, antibody-drug conjugate.

**Mechanism of Action:** Polatuzumab vedotin targets the CD79b protein found on B-cells. After binding, it is internalized, releasing the cytotoxic agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) inside the cell. MMAE inhibits cell division by disrupting microtubules, leading to cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

* Polatuzumab vedotin-piiq
* Polivy™ (brand name)


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Polatuzumab vedotin exerts its anti-cancer effects by delivering MMAE specifically to B-cells, leading to their destruction. This targeted approach minimizes damage to healthy cells.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Administered intravenously.
* **Distribution:** Distributes to target tissues expressing CD79b.
* **Metabolism:** Polatuzumab vedotin is catabolized to small peptides and amino acids, MMAE, and unconjugated MMAE-related catabolites. MMAE is metabolized by CYP3A4.
* **Elimination:** Elimination pathways are not fully characterized, but MMAE is primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion.

**Mode of Action:**  The antibody component binds to CD79b, a protein essential for B-cell receptor signaling.  Internalization of the antibody-drug conjugate delivers MMAE, which binds to tubulin, disrupting microtubule formation and inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

**Receptor Binding:** CD79b

**Enzyme Inhibition:** Tubulin polymerization

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion of MMAE


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Relapsed or Refractory DLBCL:** 1.8 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 90 minutes every 21 days for 6 cycles in combination with bendamustine and rituximab. Subsequent infusions may be given over 30 minutes if tolerated. Maximum single dose per cycle 240mg.
* **Previously Untreated LBCL:** 1.8 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion on day 1 of each 21-day cycle, for a total of 6 cycles, given in combination with R-CHP.


#### **Children:**

Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is generally recommended, but closer monitoring is warranted due to higher incidence of adverse effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is needed for creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min.  No data are available for patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL < 30 mL/min).
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in moderate to severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin >1.5 times the upper limit of normal).
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with pre-existing peripheral neuropathy.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Polatuzumab vedotin is specifically indicated for the treatment of DLBCL and LBCL in the oncological setting, not for other clinical situations like intubation, surgical procedures, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based primarily on hematologic toxicity and peripheral neuropathy. See source material for specific guidance.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, diarrhea, pyrexia (fever), decreased appetite, pneumonia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Tumor lysis syndrome, infusion-related reactions, severe infections (including febrile neutropenia), progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential long-term effects include peripheral neuropathy.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Infusion-related reactions (fever, chills, flushing, dyspnea, hypotension, urticaria).



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to polatuzumab vedotin or any of its components.
* Moderate to severe hepatic impairment.
