## **Usage**

- Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) 3350 is primarily prescribed for the treatment of occasional constipation. It is also used for bowel cleansing prior to colonoscopies or other bowel procedures.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Osmotic laxative.
- **Mechanism of Action:** PEG 3350 works by increasing the amount of water in the intestinal tract. This softens the stool and promotes bowel movements.

## **Alternate Names**

- PEG 3350
- Polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution
- **Brand Names:** MiraLAX, GlycoLax, GaviLAX, ClearLax, Lax-A-Day, PEG-3350 with Electrolytes

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** PEG 3350 exerts its laxative effect by retaining water within the intestinal lumen through its osmotic properties. The increased water content softens the stool, increases stool volume, and stimulates peristalsis, leading to more frequent bowel movements.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** PEG 3350 is minimally absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The small amount that is absorbed is excreted unchanged in the urine. It is not metabolized by CYP enzymes.  Elimination is primarily through fecal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:**  PEG 3350 is a large molecule that exerts its action through its high molecular weight and its ability to form hydrogen bonds with water. This prevents water reabsorption from the gut, thereby increasing stool water content and volume. It does not bind to receptors, inhibit enzymes, or modulate neurotransmitters directly.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily fecal excretion; minimal renal excretion of the unabsorbed drug.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 17 grams (approximately one capful or packet) orally once daily, dissolved in 4 to 8 ounces of liquid.
- Maximum dosage: Not to exceed 7 days of continuous use without consulting a doctor.

#### **Children:**

- For children 2-16 years of age: 0.4 g/kg/day orally, initially. Dosage may be adjusted in the range of 0.2 g/kg/day to 1.8 g/kg/day. Maximum dose is 17 g/day.
- For infants and children younger than 2 years: Consult a pediatrician for appropriate dosing guidance.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with the standard adult dosage. Careful monitoring is recommended, as elderly patients may be more susceptible to side effects, especially dehydration.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustment is generally necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustment is generally necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution advised for patients with electrolyte imbalances, heart problems, and gastrointestinal disorders. Individualized dosage adjustments may be needed.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use/Emergency Situations:**  PEG is not typically used in these settings. Other laxatives or bowel management strategies are usually preferred.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments based on patient-specific factors are generally not necessary, except for children and patients with specific comorbidities as mentioned above.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Bloating
- Gas
- Abdominal discomfort or cramping
- Nausea
- Diarrhea

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (e.g., hives, itching, rash, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
- Severe or bloody diarrhea
- Rectal bleeding

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Electrolyte imbalances (with prolonged or excessive use)
- Laxative dependence (with prolonged or excessive use)

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
- Severe dehydration
-  Ischemic colitis

## **Contraindications**

- Known or suspected bowel obstruction
- Gastrointestinal perforation
- Toxic megacolon
- Hypersensitivity to polyethylene glycol

## **Drug Interactions**

- May reduce the absorption of other orally administered medications if taken within two hours of each other.
- May interact with diuretics, increasing the risk of electrolyte imbalances.
- May interact with other laxatives, potentially increasing the risk of side effects.
- No known interactions with CYP450 enzymes.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Category C (US FDA). Studies in animals have shown some adverse effects on the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans. PEG 3350 should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
- **Breastfeeding:**  No specific recommendations for breastfeeding women. Minimal amounts are expected to be excreted in breast milk due to poor systemic absorption.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Osmotic laxative that retains water in the bowel, softening stool and promoting bowel movements.
- **Side Effects:** Bloating, gas, abdominal discomfort, nausea, diarrhea. Rarely, allergic reactions, severe diarrhea, rectal bleeding.
- **Contraindications:** Bowel obstruction, GI perforation, toxic megacolon, hypersensitivity to PEG.
- **Drug Interactions:** May affect absorption of other oral medications. May interact with diuretics and other laxatives.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution during pregnancy. No specific recommendations for breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 17 grams orally once daily. Children:  0.4 g/kg/day.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for signs of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, especially in elderly patients.

## **Popular Combinations**

- PEG 3350 is often combined with electrolytes for bowel preparation before colonoscopies.

## **Precautions**

- Monitor fluid and electrolyte balance, especially in elderly patients.
- Discontinue use if rectal bleeding occurs.
- Avoid use for more than 7 days without consulting a doctor.
