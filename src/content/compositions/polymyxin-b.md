## **Usage**

Polymyxin B is an antibiotic primarily used to treat infections caused by gram-negative bacteria, particularly *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*.  It is effective against  *Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae*, and *Enterobacter aerogenes*. It's prescribed for conditions like urinary tract infections, meningitis, bacteremia, and eye infections. Its pharmacological classification is as a polypeptide antibiotic.  

Polymyxin B works by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane. It binds to the negatively charged lipopolysaccharide in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, altering its structure and permeability. This leads to leakage of intracellular contents and ultimately, bacterial cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

Polymyxin B sulfate is an alternate name. Brand names include Polytrim (in combination with trimethoprim for ophthalmic use).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Polymyxin B exerts its bactericidal effect by targeting the bacterial cell membrane. The disruption of the cell membrane causes leakage of cell contents, leading to bacterial death.

**Pharmacokinetics:** 

* **Absorption:** Polymyxin B has poor oral absorption. It's administered intravenously, intramuscularly, intrathecally (into the spinal canal), topically (for eye infections), or subconjunctivally (injection under the conjunctiva of the eye).
* **Distribution:** Its distribution in the body is limited, except for the kidneys. Negligible amounts cross the blood-brain barrier.
* **Metabolism:** It is not significantly metabolized.
* **Excretion:** Primarily excreted renally, necessitating dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment.

**Mode of Action:** Polymyxin B's cationic nature enables it to bind to the anionic lipopolysaccharide molecules present in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria.  This interaction disrupts the membrane's structural integrity, causing increased permeability. The resultant leakage of essential intracellular components leads to cell death.  Polymyxin B doesn't involve receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation in its mechanism of action.

**Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Intravenous (IV):** 15,000-25,000 units/kg/day, divided every 12 hours; not to exceed 25,000 units/kg/day.
* **Intramuscular (IM):** 25,000-30,000 units/kg/day, divided every 4-6 hours (not routinely recommended due to pain at the injection site).
* **Intrathecal:** 50,000 units daily for 3-4 days, then every other day for at least two weeks after CSF sterility and normalization of glucose are confirmed.


#### **Children:**

* **IV:** 15,000-40,000 units/kg/day, divided every 12 hours; not to exceed 25,000 units/kg/day.
* **IM:** 25,000-40,000 units/kg/day, divided every 4-6 hours (not routinely recommended).
* **Intrathecal:** (Under 2 years) 20,000 units daily for 3-4 days, then 25,000 units every other day; (Over 2 years) 50,000 units daily for 3-4 days, then every other day for at least two weeks after CSF sterility.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Monitor renal function and adjust dosage accordingly.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dosage reductions are necessary depending upon creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** As it is primarily renally cleared, hepatic dysfunction doesn't typically require dosage adjustments. 
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider drug interactions with other medications.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing in specific clinical settings follows standard recommendations and adjusts per special cases.  

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are based on creatinine clearance, age, and other patient factors.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
* Nephrotoxicity (e.g., albuminuria, azotemia, cylindruria)
* Neurotoxicity (e.g., dizziness, drowsiness, paresthesias, flushing, ataxia)
* Pain at the injection site (IM)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Apnea (especially with concurrent use of neuromuscular blocking agents)
* Anaphylaxis


### **Long-Term Effects:**  

* Renal damage with prolonged high-dose use
* Neurologic deficits with prolonged high-dose use

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, hypersensitivity.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to polymyxin B
* Pre-existing renal dysfunction (severe)
* Concurrent use of other nephrotoxic or neurotoxic drugs (caution)
* Myasthenia gravis (caution)


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Neuromuscular blocking agents:** Increased risk of respiratory paralysis
* **Aminoglycosides & other nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., NSAIDs, cisplatin):** Increased nephrotoxicity
* **Cephalosporins:** Increased risk of neurotoxicity


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Pregnancy Safety Category C (FDA): Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk. There's limited data on its use in pregnancy.  May interfere with folate metabolism, impacting fetal development.
* **Breastfeeding:** Excretion in breast milk unknown. Topical application is considered low risk. Use caution with other routes of administration. 


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Disrupts bacterial cell membrane permeability.
* **Side Effects:** Nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, injection site pain.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe renal dysfunction.
* **Drug Interactions:** Neuromuscular blockers, aminoglycosides, nephrotoxic drugs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category C; use with caution. Topical application low risk.
* **Dosage:** Refer to the dosage section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function (BUN, creatinine), neurologic status.

## **Popular Combinations**

* **Trimethoprim:** Often combined with polymyxin B for ophthalmic solutions (e.g., Polytrim), broadening the spectrum of antibacterial activity.

## **Precautions**

* Monitor renal function closely, especially in elderly patients and those with pre-existing renal insufficiency.
* Reduce dosage in patients with renal impairment.
* Avoid concurrent use of nephrotoxic or neurotoxic drugs.
* Monitor for neurologic symptoms, such as paresthesias, ataxia, dizziness, and drowsiness.
