## **Usage**

- Polypodium leucotomos extract (PLE) is primarily used as an oral photoprotective agent, offering protection against the harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. It's also being investigated for its potential benefits in various skin conditions like polymorphous light eruption, other photodermatoses, melasma, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis, and actinic keratosis.  It has also been suggested for use in other conditions like dementia and certain cancers, but more research is needed.  It is marketed as a dietary supplement, not as a drug.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Photoprotectant, antioxidant, immunomodulator.
- **Mechanism of Action:** PLE exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. It protects against UV-induced DNA damage, reduces inflammation, and modulates immune responses, thereby mitigating the skin's reaction to UV exposure.

## **Alternate Names**

- *Phlebodium aureum*, Calaguala, Anapsos, Difur, Fernblock.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** PLE exerts its photoprotective effects through multiple mechanisms: scavenging free radicals, inhibiting UV-induced inflammation, reducing erythema, protecting Langerhans cells, and promoting DNA repair.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Limited information is available. PLE is administered orally or topically. Absorption, metabolism, and elimination pathways have not been extensively studied.  It is thought that some components may undergo hepatic metabolism, especially through the CYP450 pathway.
- **Mode of Action:** PLE's polyphenols, including ferulic, caffeic, p-coumaric, vanillic, and chlorogenic acids, act as antioxidants, neutralizing free radicals generated by UV exposure. It also appears to modulate cytokine balance and exhibit anti-angiogenic activity.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Precise elimination pathways are not fully characterized, but both renal and hepatic routes are likely involved.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Photoprotection: 240-480 mg orally, once or twice daily. Higher doses (up to 960 mg/day) have been studied for conditions like vitiligo.
- Atopic Dermatitis: Up to 480 mg/day.
- Actinic Keratosis:  960 mg/day initially, followed by 480 mg/day.

#### **Children:**

- Limited data exists on pediatric dosing.  Some studies have investigated doses up to 480 mg/day for atopic dermatitis. Pediatric use should be under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: Dosage adjustment may not be necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**:  No specific guidelines available. Caution is advised.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: No specific guidelines available. Caution is advised due to the potential for hepatic metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Dosage adjustments should be considered based on the specific comorbidity.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Intubation: No specific dosage recommendations.
- Surgical Procedures: No specific dosage recommendations.
- Mechanical Ventilation: No specific dosage recommendations.
- Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use: No specific dosage recommendations.
- Emergency Situations: No specific dosage recommendations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose modifications should be considered in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, and in those with comorbid conditions.  Drug interactions, particularly those involving the CYP450 metabolic pathway, should be considered when adjusting dosage.
