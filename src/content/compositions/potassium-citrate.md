      What is the recommended dosage for Potassium Citrate?**


      **A:** The dosage varies depending on the specific condition and patient
      factors. For adults with severe hypocitraturia (urinary citrate < 150
      mg/day), the initial dose is typically 60 mEq/day, divided into two or
      three doses. For mild to moderate hypocitraturia (urinary citrate > 150
      mg/day), the initial dose is usually 30 mEq/day, divided into two or three
      doses. Pediatric dosages are based on body weight and should be determined
      and monitored by a physician.

## **Usage**

Potassium citrate is prescribed for the management of:

* **Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) with calcium stones:**  RTA is a condition where the kidneys don't properly remove acids from the blood, leading to an increased risk of kidney stones.
* **Hypocitraturic calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis:** This refers to kidney stones made of calcium oxalate that are formed due to low levels of citrate in the urine.
* **Uric acid lithiasis with or without calcium stones:**  This involves kidney stones composed of uric acid, sometimes occurring alongside calcium stones.  Potassium citrate helps alkalinize the urine and prevent uric acid stone formation.
* **Symptomatic relief of dysuria associated with mild urinary tract infections (UTIs):** In some regions, potassium citrate is used to relieve pain and discomfort during urination caused by mild UTIs. Note that it is not an antibacterial agent and should be used in conjunction with appropriate antibiotic therapy.


**Pharmacological Classification:**

Potassium citrate can be classified as a:

* **Urinary alkalinizer:** It increases urinary pH, making the urine less acidic.
* **Potassium supplement:**  It provides potassium, an essential electrolyte.
* **Urolithiasis prophylaxis:** It helps prevent the formation of certain types of kidney stones.

**Mechanism of Action:**

Potassium citrate works primarily by increasing citrate levels in the urine. Citrate inhibits the crystallization and growth of calcium salts, thus preventing the formation of calcium stones. The alkalinizing effect also helps dissolve uric acid stones and reduces the discomfort associated with UTIs.



## **Alternate Names**

* **Tripotassium citrate**
* **Potassium citrate monohydrate**

**Brand Names:**

* Urocit-K
* Twin-K
* K-Lyte (in combination with potassium bicarbonate)



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Potassium citrate increases urinary citrate and pH. Increased urinary citrate inhibits the crystallization of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate, thus preventing kidney stone formation. Elevated urinary pH increases the solubility of uric acid, preventing the formation of uric acid stones.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Potassium citrate is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
* **Metabolism:** Citrate is metabolized to bicarbonate, which contributes to the alkalinizing effect.
* **Elimination:**  Primarily renal excretion.


**Mode of Action:** Citrate in the urine binds to calcium, forming soluble complexes. This reduces the free calcium concentration, thereby inhibiting the formation of calcium-containing kidney stones. Simultaneously, citrate inhibits crystal growth and aggregation.  The increase in urinary pH enhances the solubility of uric acid, preventing uric acid stone precipitation.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Severe hypocitraturia (urinary citrate < 150 mg/day):** Initial dose: 60 mEq/day, divided into two or three doses with meals or within 30 minutes after meals or a bedtime snack.
* **Mild to moderate hypocitraturia (urinary citrate > 150 mg/day):** Initial dose: 30 mEq/day, divided into two or three doses with meals or within 30 minutes after meals or a bedtime snack.
* **Maximum dose:** Generally, doses above 100 mEq/day are not recommended unless under specific circumstances.


#### **Children:**

Dosage in children is usually based on body weight (e.g., 2-4 mEq/kg/day, divided into three doses) and requires careful monitoring by a physician. Safety and effectiveness in children under one year of age have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments may be necessary based on renal function and other comorbidities.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate < 0.7 mL/kg/min).  Dose adjustments are crucial in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.  Close monitoring of potassium levels is essential.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically required, but caution is advised.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider interactions with other medications, particularly those affecting potassium levels.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  Dosage recommendations for specific medical settings outside of kidney stone treatment and UTIs have not been established and should be individualized. Potassium supplementation might be useful in conditions associated with hypokalemia. 

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are crucial in patients with renal impairment, considering their creatinine clearance. Monitor serum potassium levels carefully in these patients to avoid hyperkalemia.
