## **Usage**

- Potassium dihydrogen phosphate is primarily used to treat *hypophosphatemia* (low phosphate levels in the blood). It can also be used to treat conditions where both phosphate and potassium levels are low, and oral supplementation is not feasible. Additionally, it is used to provide phosphate and potassium during intravenous feeding (parenteral nutrition).
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Electrolyte supplement, Urinary acidifier.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Potassium dihydrogen phosphate works by directly supplying phosphate ions to the body. These ions are essential for many bodily functions including energy production, nerve and muscle function, and bone health.  It also acts to acidify the urine which can help prevent the formation of certain types of kidney stones.

## **Alternate Names**

- Monobasic potassium phosphate
- Potassium phosphate monobasic
- KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Potassium dihydrogen phosphate increases serum phosphate concentrations. It also lowers urinary pH, thereby inhibiting the crystallization of calcium-containing kidney stones.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** When administered intravenously, it is directly absorbed into the bloodstream.  When administered orally, phosphate salts are absorbed from the small intestine by passive diffusion and active transport. Absorption can be affected by factors like the presence of calcium, aluminum, or magnesium.
    - **Metabolism:** Phosphate is not metabolized in the body but is incorporated into various organic compounds.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily excreted by the kidneys, with the rate of excretion dependent on serum phosphate concentration, parathyroid hormone levels, and dietary intake. Some phosphate is also eliminated in the feces.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Intravenous:** For severe hypophosphatemia (serum phosphate < 0.3 mmol/L), up to 10 mmol of phosphate can be administered over 12 hours, repeated every 12 hours until serum phosphate levels are above 0.3 mmol/L.  The rate of infusion should not exceed 0.2 mmol/kg/hour.  For less severe hypophosphatemia, lower doses are used, guided by serum phosphate levels.

#### **Children:**

- **Intravenous:**  0.15-0.33 mmol/kg administered over 6 hours. The dose may be repeated at 6-hour intervals until serum phosphate exceeds 0.6 mmol/L.  The dose should not exceed the maximum recommended adult dose. The rate of infusion should not exceed 0.2 mmol/kg/hour.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment may be required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce the dosage based on the severity of impairment. In severe renal impairment, the use of potassium dihydrogen phosphate is contraindicated.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Monitor for electrolyte imbalances.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring of electrolytes is necessary.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage is always determined by the patient's specific needs and should be titrated according to serum phosphate levels and clinical response.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dosage adjustments are necessary for patients with renal impairment and should be guided by electrolyte monitoring.

## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Swelling of feet or lower legs
- Weight gain


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Muscle weakness or cramps
- Convulsions
- Confusion
- Tiredness
- Irregular or slow heart rate
- Unexplained anxiety
- Tingling or numbness of the hands or feet
- Breathing difficulties
- Increased thirst and decreased urination
- Hyperkalemia
- Hyperphosphatemia
- Hypocalcemia


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Acute renal failure
- Cardiac arrhythmias
- Tetany (with large doses)

## **Contraindications**

- Hyperkalemia
- Hyperphosphatemia
- Hypocalcemia
- Severe renal impairment
- Hypersensitivity to potassium phosphate

## **Drug Interactions**

- Calcium-containing medications: May increase the risk of soft tissue calcification.
- Potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, triamterene): Increased risk of hyperkalemia.
- ACE inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril): Increased risk of hyperkalemia.
- Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (e.g., valsartan): Increased risk of hyperkalemia.
- Digitalis glycosides (e.g., digoxin): Increased risk of hyperkalemia, which can increase digitalis toxicity.
- Salicylates: Potassium dihydrogen phosphate can decrease salicylate excretion, potentially leading to salicylate toxicity.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- The safety of potassium dihydrogen phosphate during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been established. Use only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the fetus or infant.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Replaces phosphate and potassium deficits.
- **Side Effects:** Common: Swelling, weight gain. Serious:  Electrolyte imbalances, arrhythmias, renal failure.
- **Contraindications:** Hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, severe renal impairment.
- **Drug Interactions:** Calcium, potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, digitalis, salicylates.

## **Popular Combinations**

Potassium dihydrogen phosphate is often used in combination with other electrolytes in parenteral nutrition solutions tailored to individual patient needs.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Monitor serum electrolyte levels, especially calcium, potassium, and phosphate. Closely observe cardiac and renal function, particularly during intravenous administration. Monitor ECG during rapid intravenous infusions.
- **Specific Populations:** Adjust dosage in patients with renal impairment. Use with caution in elderly patients.
