## **Usage**

Potassium Magnesium Citrate is primarily prescribed for the prevention and treatment of kidney stones, particularly those composed of calcium. It is also used to manage renal tubular acidosis (RTA) and hypocitraturic calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis.  It helps alkalinize the urine and reduce crystallization.

It's pharmacological classification is as urinary alkalinizer and a mineral supplement.

The citrate component of this medication is metabolized to bicarbonate, which increases urinary pH and citrate levels.  This inhibits the crystallization of stone-forming salts like calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate in the urine. The increase in urinary magnesium also contributes to inhibiting stone formation. Increased potassium may transiently reduce urinary calcium.

## **Alternate Names**

While "Potassium Magnesium Citrate" is the standard generic name, some formulations might include additional ingredients like Vitamin B6. There isn't an internationally recognized non-proprietary name distinct from the generic name. Brand names can vary regionally; examples include Urocit-K (for potassium citrate component) and Twin-K (for potassium citrate). Many regional and local brand names may exist for combination products containing Potassium Magnesium Citrate.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Potassium Magnesium Citrate increases urinary citrate and pH.  The increased citrate and magnesium inhibit the crystallization of calcium salts, reducing kidney stone formation. Potassium may also induce a transient reduction in urinary calcium.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Potassium and magnesium citrate are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Citrate is metabolized to bicarbonate.
* **Metabolism:** Citrate is metabolized in the liver to bicarbonate.
* **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion; a small percentage is excreted unchanged in the urine.

**Mode of Action:** After absorption, citrate is converted to bicarbonate, leading to alkalinization of the urine. Citrate also directly binds to calcium in the urine forming soluble complexes, reducing free calcium concentration and increasing the inhibitory effect on stone formation. Magnesium, alongside citrate, interferes with the growth and aggregation of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate crystals. Potassium helps in maintaining appropriate pH levels.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
Dosages may vary based on the specific condition being treated.  Typical doses range from 10-30 mEq of potassium citrate and 7.5-15 mEq of magnesium citrate three times daily taken after meals, or as prescribed. Dosages as high as 60-100 mEq/day are possible but should be monitored for potassium levels to avoid hyperkalemia.


#### **Children:**

Safety and effectiveness have not been established for children under 2 years of age.  Dosage for children older than 2 years is individualized to body weight and clinical condition by a healthcare professional.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Monitor renal function; dosage adjustments may be necessary based on serum electrolyte levels.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; contraindicated with renal failure. Reduce the dose based on the degree of impairment to prevent accumulation and potential toxicity. Close monitoring of electrolytes is crucial.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific adjustments are typically needed as the metabolism of citrate is relatively independent of liver function.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate potential interactions with other medications for conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and gastrointestinal disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  
Dosing in specific clinical use cases is determined based on the overall clinical condition and not affected by procedures such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation or presence in ICU.

### **Dosage Adjustments**  
Adjustments are made based on serum potassium and magnesium levels, urine pH, and urinary citrate. Patients with renal dysfunction or those taking potassium-sparing medications require careful monitoring and dose reductions.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**
Abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flatulence.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Hyperkalemia (high potassium), hypermagnesemia (high magnesium), allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), esophageal ulcers (throat pain, difficulty swallowing), cardiac arrhythmias.

### **Long-Term Effects**  
Gastrointestinal issues with chronic use. Electrolyte imbalances if not monitored properly, especially with pre-existing renal conditions.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), severe hyperkalemia leading to cardiac arrest.


## **Contraindications**
Hyperkalemia, severe renal impairment, anuria, untreated Addison's disease, conditions causing delayed gastrointestinal transit (e.g., intestinal obstruction), peptic ulcer disease.


## **Drug Interactions**

Potassium-sparing diuretics (amiloride, triamterene, spironolactone), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, NSAIDs, potassium supplements, certain antibiotics (tetracyclines, quinolones). Antacids, medications for stomach issues (e.g. dicyclomine), potassium supplements, or potassium-sparing diuretics can increase the risk of hyperkalemia.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category: C (consult a physician; benefits must outweigh risks).  Although generally considered safe, there is limited data in pregnancy, so caution is advised. Consult a doctor for appropriate assessment of risks and benefits.

It is excreted in breast milk. Consult a doctor before using during breastfeeding; closely monitor infants for diarrhea.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Alkalinizes urine, increases urinary citrate and magnesium, inhibits crystallization of kidney stones.
* **Side Effects:**  Abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting; rarely hyperkalemia, hypermagnesemia.
* **Contraindications:** Hyperkalemia, severe renal impairment, anuria, intestinal obstruction, peptic ulcer.
* **Drug Interactions:** Potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult a doctor; potential risks exist.
* **Dosage:** Varies according to indication; consult guidelines or a physician.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Serum potassium, magnesium, creatinine, urine pH, and urinary citrate.

## **Popular Combinations**

Often used alone, but it may be combined with other therapies for kidney stones, including thiazide diuretics (with careful monitoring). Vitamin B6 may be added in some formulations.


## **Precautions**

* Regular monitoring of serum potassium and magnesium levels is essential, particularly in patients with renal impairment.
* Avoid concurrent use with potassium-sparing diuretics and potassium supplements.
* Caution should be exercised in patients with heart conditions due to the potential for hyperkalemia.
* Monitor for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding.
