## **Usage**

- Pramoxine is prescribed for the temporary relief of pain and itching associated with various minor skin irritations. These include minor burns, cuts, scrapes, sunburn, eczema, insect bites, rashes from poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac, cold sores, and dry, itchy skin. It is also used to relieve soreness, itching, burning, and pain caused by hemorrhoids and other minor rectal irritations like anal fissures.  Some formulations are used for itching around the vagina/rectum.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Pramoxine is classified as a topical anesthetic.

## **Alternate Names**

Pramoxine hydrochloride is the chemical name. It is also known as pramoxine HCl.  It is marketed under various brand names like Proctofoam, Gold Bond Anti-Itch, Pramox, Prax, and Sarna Sensitive. It is also an ingredient in various combination products which include other active ingredients such as hydrocortisone or phenylephrine.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Pramoxine acts locally by stabilizing neuronal membranes. It works by decreasing the permeability of neuronal membranes to sodium ions, which inhibits the initiation and conduction of sensory nerve impulses. This leads to a loss of sensation in the affected area, providing relief from pain and itching.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Pramoxine is poorly absorbed through intact skin. Absorption increases with factors like larger surface area of application, the presence of skin lesions, and higher concentrations of the drug.  Limited systemic absorption means limited information is available about its metabolism and elimination.  Available data suggests ester-type agents related to pramoxine are metabolized in plasma and by liver cholinesterases.  Amide type anesthetic agents, although not directly pramoxine itself, if absorbed systemically, are primarily metabolized by the liver.  Information regarding pramoxine's specific elimination pathways (renal/hepatic excretion, metabolism by CYP enzymes, etc.) is limited.
- **Mode of Action:** Pramoxine reversibly binds to sodium channels in nerve cell membranes, blocking the influx of sodium ions necessary for generating action potentials. This prevents the transmission of pain and itch signals along the nerve fibers.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Skin Irritations:** Apply a 1% cream, lotion, gel, or spray to the affected area 3 to 4 times daily. 
- **Hemorrhoids:** Apply a 1% cream, lotion, foam, or rectal pads to the affected area up to 5 times daily or after each bowel movement.

#### **Children:**

- **Skin Irritations:** For children 2 years and older, a 1% cream, lotion, gel, or spray can be applied to the affected area 3-4 times daily.
- **Hemorrhoids:** For children 12 years and older, a 1% cream, lotion, foam or pads can be applied up to 5 times a day or after each bowel movement.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution due to potential age-related decrease in hepatic, renal, or cardiac function. Start with the lowest effective dose.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustments are available. Use with caution.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments are available. Use with caution.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with diabetes, as long-term or high-dose use may increase blood sugar levels. Consider underlying conditions and other medications.



### **Clinical Use Cases**  Dosage information for specific clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, and ICU use is not explicitly defined for pramoxine.  Its primary usage is limited to topical anesthesia for minor skin and rectal irritations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Data on dose modifications based on renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms is not available.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
Local reactions at the application site, such as mild burning, stinging,  irritation, redness, rash, and/or swelling.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) characterized by difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, tongue, or throat, dizziness, and hives.


### **Long-Term Effects**
No specific long-term effects are documented. However, prolonged use, especially with high-potency formulations, may lead to skin thinning or other local skin changes.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Allergic contact dermatitis.



## **Contraindications**

Known hypersensitivity to pramoxine or any component of the formulation. Do not apply to open wounds or severely damaged skin. Avoid contact with eyes, nose, ears, or mouth.



## **Drug Interactions**

No specific drug interactions are well documented for topical pramoxine due to limited systemic absorption. However, concomitant use with other topical medications on the same area might lead to additive effects or skin irritation. Be cautious when using multiple topical products on the same area.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**


- **Pregnancy:**  Animal studies are lacking, and human data is limited. Use cautiously during pregnancy only when benefits outweigh potential risks.  Avoid prolonged use or use over large areas.
- **Breastfeeding:**  It is not known whether pramoxine is excreted in breast milk. Exercise caution during breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Topical anesthetic; blocks nerve impulse conduction by reducing sodium permeability across nerve membranes.
- **Side Effects:** Local irritation, burning, stinging, redness, rash. Rarely: allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to pramoxine.
- **Drug Interactions:** No significant drug interactions documented.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
- **Dosage:** Topical application 3-4 times daily for skin irritations; up to 5 times daily for hemorrhoids.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor the application site for local reactions or signs of allergic contact dermatitis.


## **Popular Combinations**

Pramoxine is often combined with hydrocortisone (a corticosteroid) to provide anti-inflammatory and anti-itch effects in addition to pain relief. It may also be combined with phenylephrine (a decongestant) for hemorrhoid treatment to shrink swollen tissues.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Do not apply to broken or infected skin. Avoid contact with eyes. Discontinue use if condition worsens or does not improve within 7 days.
- **Specific Populations:** See Pregnancy and Breastfeeding sections. Children under 2 years should not use for skin irritations, and those under 12 years should not use for hemorrhoids or other genital/anal conditions without consulting a doctor. Elderly patients: Use cautiously due to age-related physiological changes.
