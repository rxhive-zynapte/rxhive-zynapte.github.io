## **Usage**

Pravastatin is primarily prescribed for the management of hyperlipidemia, including primary prevention of coronary events in at-risk individuals and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in those with established cardiovascular disease. It's also beneficial for prophylaxis of cardiovascular events in high-risk patients even with normal cholesterol levels. It belongs to the pharmacological class of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins.  Pravastatin works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme crucial for cholesterol synthesis in the liver. This inhibition effectively reduces the production of cholesterol, lowering overall cholesterol levels, especially LDL cholesterol ("bad" cholesterol).

## **Alternate Names**

Pravastatin sodium is the chemical name. It is widely recognized by its generic name "pravastatin" internationally.  A popular brand name under which pravastatin is marketed is Pravachol.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Pravastatin exerts its therapeutic effect by competitively inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in the mevalonate pathway responsible for cholesterol biosynthesis. This inhibition leads to reduced hepatic cholesterol production, thereby lowering total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels while modestly increasing HDL cholesterol ("good" cholesterol).

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Pravastatin is administered orally and is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver, where it is converted to active metabolites. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within 1 to 1.5 hours after administration.  Pravastatin is primarily eliminated via hepatic excretion through bile and feces, with minimal renal excretion. It's metabolized by CYP enzymes, particularly CYP3A4, to a lesser extent.

**Mode of Action:** Pravastatin's mode of action involves competitive binding to the active site of HMG-CoA reductase, preventing the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a precursor to cholesterol.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Pravastatin is primarily eliminated via hepatic routes through biliary excretion and fecal elimination.  A small portion is metabolized by CYP3A4.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The recommended starting dose is 40 mg orally once daily, preferably in the evening.  The dose can be increased to a maximum of 80 mg daily if necessary to achieve desired cholesterol levels.

#### **Children (8-18 years old with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia):**

* **8-13 years:** 20 mg orally once daily (maximum 20 mg/day if co-administered with cyclosporine).
* **14-18 years:** 40 mg orally once daily. Doses above 40mg haven't been studied in children.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Initiate therapy with a lower dose (e.g., 10-20 mg daily) and titrate cautiously. Consider renal function and potential drug interactions.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** A starting dose of 10 mg daily is recommended for patients with severe renal impairment.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Pravastatin is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or other relevant conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Pravastatin is not typically used in acute medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary role is in the long-term management of hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular risk reduction.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be required based on patient-specific factors, such as renal or hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.  Concurrent use of certain medications (e.g., cyclosporine, clarithromycin, gemfibrozil) necessitates dose adjustments.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Myalgia, arthralgia, headache, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and upper respiratory tract infection.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown), hepatotoxicity (liver damage), myopathy, and hypersensitivity reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

The potential long-term effects of pravastatin are mainly related to its benefits in reducing cardiovascular events. However, chronic use requires monitoring for muscle and liver function.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Clinically significant ADRs include myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, hepatotoxicity, and allergic reactions. These require immediate intervention and discontinuation of the drug.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to pravastatin.
* Active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of serum transaminases.
* Pregnancy.
* Breastfeeding.

## **Drug Interactions**

Clinically significant drug interactions can occur with:

* **CYP3A4 inhibitors:**  (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole). These can increase pravastatin concentrations and the risk of myopathy.
* **Fibrates:** (e.g., gemfibrozil). The combination increases the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.
* **Immunosuppressants:** (e.g., cyclosporine). Pravastatin dose should be limited to 20 mg/day.
* **Niacin, colchicine**: Increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis
* **Bile acid sequestrants**: Should be taken at least 4 hours before or after pravastatin
* **Red yeast rice**: Contraindicated, risk of myopathy. 

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pravastatin is contraindicated during pregnancy (Pregnancy Category X) and breastfeeding. It can cause fetal harm and has potential risks to nursing infants.  Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception while taking pravastatin.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin), lowering cholesterol biosynthesis.
* **Side Effects:** Common: Myalgia, headache, nausea. Serious: Rhabdomyolysis, hepatotoxicity.
* **Contraindications:**  Hypersensitivity, active liver disease, pregnancy, breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors, fibrates, cyclosporine.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 40-80 mg daily. Children (HeFH): 8-13 yrs: 20 mg daily; 14-18 yrs: 40 mg daily.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Liver function tests (LFTs), creatine kinase (CK), lipid profile.

## **Popular Combinations**

Pravastatin can be combined with other lipid-lowering agents (e.g., ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants) when monotherapy is insufficient. It may also be used in combination with antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications in patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. However, combining with gemfibrozil and other fibrates is contraindicated.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Baseline liver function tests and lipid profile should be obtained before starting therapy and periodically monitored. Monitor for signs and symptoms of myopathy.
* **Specific Populations:**  Use with caution in patients with a history of liver disease, renal impairment, or hypothyroidism.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Patients should be advised to maintain a healthy diet and exercise regimen.
