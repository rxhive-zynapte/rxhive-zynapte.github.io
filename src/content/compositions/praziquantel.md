## **Usage**

Praziquantel is an anthelmintic (anti-worm) medication prescribed for the treatment of schistosomiasis (bilharzia), clonorchiasis, and opisthorchiasis.  It is also used off-label for other parasitic worm infections like cysticercosis and other tapeworm infections.

## **Alternate Names**

* Biltricide (brand name)

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Praziquantel increases the permeability of cell membranes in susceptible worms, leading to rapid muscle contraction and paralysis of the parasite. This also causes vacuolization and tegumental disintegration, making the worms vulnerable to host immune responses.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Praziquantel is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.
* **Metabolism:**  It is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4 enzymes, into inactive metabolites.
* **Elimination:** Metabolites are mainly excreted in urine, with minimal fecal elimination.

**Mode of Action:** Praziquantel affects calcium channel function within the parasite, resulting in increased calcium influx, leading to muscle contraction, paralysis, and damage to the worm's tegument.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**  

#### **Adults:**  

* **Schistosomiasis:** 20 mg/kg orally three times a day for one day (doses given 4-6 hours apart). Alternatively, a single dose of 40 mg/kg may be administered for *S. haematobium, S. mansoni*, and *S. intercalatum*, or two doses of 30 mg/kg given 4 hours apart for *S. japonicum* and *S. mekongi*. 
* **Clonorchiasis and Opisthorchiasis:** 25 mg/kg orally three times a day for one day (doses given 4-6 hours apart).


#### **Children (4 years and older):**  

* **Schistosomiasis:** 20 mg/kg orally three times a day for one day (doses given 4-6 hours apart).
* **Clonorchiasis and Opisthorchiasis:** 25 mg/kg orally three times a day for one day (doses given 4-6 hours apart).
* Safety and efficacy have not been established in children under 4 years of age.


#### **Special Cases:**  

* **Elderly Patients**:  Use with caution due to potential age-related renal impairment. Monitor for adverse effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Dose adjustments are generally not necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Use with caution in moderate to severe hepatic impairment.  Reduced drug clearance can lead to increased plasma concentrations. 
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Exercise caution in patients with cardiac irregularities or a history of seizures.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  

Praziquantel is typically administered orally for the specific treatment of parasitic worm infections. Its use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations is not directly relevant.

### **Dosage Adjustments**  

Dose adjustments may be required in specific cases, such as heavy worm burden, liver impairment, and concomitant use of certain medications (see Drug Interactions).



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**  

* Abdominal pain/discomfort
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Fever
* Malaise
* Itching
* Urticaria (hives)
* Drowsiness

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**  

* Allergic reactions (angioedema, anaphylaxis)
* Seizures
* Cardiac arrhythmias (bradycardia, AV block)
* Severe CNS effects (especially in patients with neurocysticercosis)


### **Long-Term Effects**  

Chronic complications from prolonged praziquantel use are rare.  However, theoretical long-term effects could include liver or kidney damage with repeated high-dose therapy.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

* Clinically significant ADRs include severe allergic reactions, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias and hepatic dysfunction.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to praziquantel
* Ocular cysticercosis
* Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin)

## **Drug Interactions**

* **CYP3A4 Inducers (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin):** Reduce praziquantel efficacy.
* **CYP3A4 Inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, grapefruit juice):**  Increase praziquantel plasma levels.
* **Hormonal Contraceptives:** Praziquantel may decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Praziquantel is generally considered safe during pregnancy, especially for treatment of schistosomiasis.  Use in the first trimester should be cautiously assessed based on the risk of untreated maternal disease. 
* **Breastfeeding:** Praziquantel is excreted in breast milk at low concentrations. Breastfeeding can generally be resumed 24 hours after the last dose.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Increases cell membrane permeability in susceptible worms.
* **Side Effects:** Abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, nausea, fever, itching.  Rarely: seizures, allergic reactions, cardiac arrhythmias.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, ocular cysticercosis, strong CYP3A4 inducers.
* **Drug Interactions:**  CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors, hormonal contraceptives.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe.
* **Dosage:**  See Dosage section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests, ECG (in patients with cardiac risk factors), clinical symptoms of adverse reactions.



## **Popular Combinations**

Praziquantel is often used alone for specific indications.  In some cases, it may be combined with other anthelmintics for mixed infections or with corticosteroids to manage inflammatory reactions associated with parasite death (e.g., in neurocysticercosis).

## **Precautions**

* Evaluate hepatic and renal function before treatment, especially in patients with known or suspected impairments.
* Patients with a history of seizures should be monitored closely.
* Patients with cardiac irregularities should undergo cardiac monitoring during treatment.
* Advise patients to avoid driving or operating machinery if dizziness or drowsiness occur.
