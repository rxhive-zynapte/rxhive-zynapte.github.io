## **Usage**

- Prazosin is primarily prescribed for the treatment of **hypertension** (high blood pressure). It's also used off-label for conditions like **benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)**, **post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related nightmares**, **Raynaud's phenomenon**, and **congestive heart failure**.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Prazosin is an **alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist** (also called an alpha-blocker).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Prazosin works by blocking alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, which are found in the smooth muscle of blood vessels and the prostate gland. By blocking these receptors, prazosin causes vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), which lowers blood pressure and improves urinary flow in BPH.

## **Alternate Names**

-  Prazosin is also known as **Prazosin hydrochloride**.
- **Brand Names:** Minipress, Prazin, Prazo, APO-Prazosin.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Prazosin exerts its effects primarily by causing peripheral vasodilation through selective and competitive antagonism of postsynaptic alpha-1-adrenergic receptors. This reduces peripheral vascular resistance, leading to a decrease in blood pressure. It also relaxes smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, improving urine flow.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Prazosin is well absorbed orally. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within 1-3 hours. It's extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4. Prazosin is excreted mainly through the bile and feces, with a small portion excreted in urine.
- **Mode of Action:**  Prazosin competitively binds to postsynaptic alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, preventing norepinephrine from binding and activating these receptors. This prevents the usual vasoconstricting effect of norepinephrine, leading to vasodilation and a reduction in blood pressure. In BPH, the relaxation of smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck is also mediated through alpha-1 receptor blockade.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism (CYP3A4) with biliary and fecal excretion, along with minor renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Hypertension:** Initial dose is 1 mg 2-3 times/day. Maintenance dose is 6-15 mg/day in divided doses (BID or TID). Can be increased up to 20 mg/day or even 40 mg/day in some cases. The first dose should be administered at bedtime to minimize first-dose syncope.
- **BPH:** Initial dose is 0.5 mg BID. Maintenance dose is 2 mg BID.
- **PTSD-related Nightmares:** Initial dose is 1 mg at bedtime. Maintenance dose is 1-15 mg at bedtime, titrated based on response and tolerability.
- **Raynaud's Phenomenon:** 0.5-1 mg daily at bedtime or 0.5 mg BID. Adjust dose based on response up to 12 mg/day divided BID/TID.

#### **Children:**

- **Hypertension (off-label):** Initial dose is 0.05-0.1 mg/kg/day orally divided every 8 hours. Titrate to 0.5 mg/kg/day; not to exceed 20 mg/day.
- Safety and efficacy in children have not been fully established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses due to increased risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Start with lower doses and titrate carefully as they may be more sensitive to prazosin’s effects.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Start with lower doses and titrate cautiously.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments might be necessary depending on the specific comorbid condition. Careful monitoring is recommended.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Prazosin is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.  Its primary indications are hypertension and BPH, and off-label uses include PTSD nightmares and Raynaud’s phenomenon.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjust dosages based on patient response, tolerance, and renal/hepatic function. Monitor for orthostatic hypotension, particularly with initial doses and dosage increases.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, drowsiness, lack of energy, weakness, palpitations, nausea, orthostatic hypotension (especially after the first dose).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- First-dose syncope, priapism, severe hypotension, allergic reactions (rash, itching, hives, swelling of face/tongue/throat, difficulty breathing).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Tolerance to the blood pressure-lowering effects can develop.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Syncope (particularly first-dose syncope), severe hypotension, allergic reactions, priapism.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to prazosin, other quinazolines (e.g., doxazosin, terazosin), or any component of the formulation.
- Use with caution in patients with a history of syncope or orthostatic hypotension.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Other antihypertensives (additive hypotensive effects).
- PDE5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil) – increased risk of hypotension.
- CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin) – may increase prazosin levels.
- CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin) – may decrease prazosin levels.
- Alcohol (increased risk of side effects like dizziness).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C. Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
- Prazosin crosses the placenta and can be excreted in breast milk. Use caution if breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist.
- **Side Effects:** Dizziness, headache, drowsiness, orthostatic hypotension, syncope.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to prazosin or quinazolines.
- **Drug Interactions:** Other antihypertensives, PDE5 inhibitors, CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers, alcohol.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
- **Dosage:**  See detailed dosage guidelines above.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure (lying and standing), heart rate.

## **Popular Combinations**

-  Prazosin is often used in combination with other antihypertensive medications, such as thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers, to achieve better blood pressure control.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Monitor blood pressure and heart rate regularly. Initiate therapy with a low dose to minimize the risk of first-dose syncope.
- **Specific Populations:** Caution should be used in pregnant and breastfeeding women. Use with caution in children and the elderly due to the risk of hypotension and other side effects.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Limit alcohol intake. Caution patients about potential dizziness and drowsiness, especially when changing positions.
