## **Usage**

Prednicarbate is prescribed for the relief of inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.  This includes conditions like eczema, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, psoriasis, and seborrheic dermatitis.

It is classified as a medium-potency topical corticosteroid.

Prednicarbate works by reducing inflammation, itching, and redness by mimicking the action of cortisol, a natural hormone produced by the adrenal glands. It binds to glucocorticoid receptors in the skin cells, altering gene expression and reducing the production of inflammatory mediators.


## **Alternate Names**

Prednicarbate is the generic name.  Some brand names include Dermatop, Prednitop, and Peitel.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Prednicarbate exerts its effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors located inside skin cells. This interaction modifies gene transcription, reducing the synthesis of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and cytokines.  It also inhibits the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the skin, further reducing inflammation and its associated symptoms.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Prednicarbate is absorbed percutaneously. The extent of absorption depends on factors like skin integrity, the vehicle used (cream or ointment), application site, and the use of occlusive dressings. Thin skin areas like the face, groin, and axillae absorb the drug more readily. Occlusive dressings enhance penetration.
* **Metabolism:** Prednicarbate is primarily metabolized in the skin and to a lesser extent in the liver via first-pass metabolism. The metabolites generated are less active than the parent drug.
* **Elimination:**  The metabolites are primarily excreted renally, with some biliary excretion.

**Mode of Action:** Prednicarbate exerts its action intracellularly by binding to specific glucocorticoid receptors. Upon binding, the drug-receptor complex translocates to the nucleus, where it interacts with DNA, influencing gene expression.  This inhibits the production of inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and cytokines, thereby reducing inflammation and associated symptoms.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Prednicarbate acts primarily via glucocorticoid receptor binding, modulating gene expression.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a thin film to the affected area twice daily.

#### **Children:**

* **Cream:** ≥1 year: Apply a thin film to the affected area twice daily.  Maximum treatment duration: 3 weeks.
* **Ointment:** ≥10 years: Apply a thin film to the affected area twice daily.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to potential for increased systemic absorption and side effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with diabetes, as topical corticosteroids can elevate blood glucose levels.  Consider the potential for drug interactions with other medications.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Prednicarbate is not indicated for use in intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) use, or emergency situations. It is exclusively for topical dermatological applications.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific dosage adjustments are indicated for renal or hepatic dysfunction.  However, caution is advised in patients with these conditions.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Burning, itching, dryness, irritation, skin atrophy, acne, folliculitis, hypopigmentation, telangiectasia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic contact dermatitis, Cushing's syndrome (with prolonged use or high doses), HPA axis suppression, hyperglycemia, secondary infections.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, hypopigmentation.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, skin infections, signs of Cushing's syndrome.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to prednicarbate, rosacea, perioral dermatitis, untreated skin infections (bacterial, fungal, viral), open wounds.



## **Drug Interactions**

Prednicarbate can interact with other medications, particularly those metabolized by CYP450 enzymes. Some examples include oral corticosteroids like prednisone, drugs that lower the immune system such as cyclosporine, and some medications for diabetes.  Consult drug interaction databases for a comprehensive list.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category: C.  Use with caution during pregnancy, weighing the potential benefits against risks to the fetus. Topical corticosteroids are generally considered compatible with breastfeeding, but avoid applying to areas where the infant could ingest the drug.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Binds to glucocorticoid receptors, modulating gene expression and suppressing inflammatory responses.
* **Side Effects:** Burning, itching, dryness, skin atrophy, risk of HPA axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, untreated skin infections, rosacea, perioral dermatitis.
* **Drug Interactions:** Can interact with other drugs, particularly CYP450 substrates.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category C; caution advised; generally compatible with breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** Apply thinly twice daily.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood glucose (in diabetic patients), signs of HPA axis suppression with prolonged use.



## **Popular Combinations**

Prednicarbate is typically used as monotherapy.  Combination therapy with other topical agents may be considered for specific conditions, but consult with a dermatologist for appropriate recommendations.



## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:**  Avoid prolonged use, especially on the face, groin, and axillae. Use caution in patients with diabetes.
* **Specific Populations:** As outlined above.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Avoid contact with eyes.  Limit alcohol consumption if experiencing side effects like skin thinning.
