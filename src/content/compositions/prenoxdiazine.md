## **Usage**

Prenoxdiazine hydrochloride is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of dry, non-productive coughs.  It is a peripherally acting antitussive. Its mechanism of action primarily involves suppressing the cough reflex by acting on peripheral cough receptors in the respiratory tract, with potential secondary central action on the cough center in the brain.  It also has mild local anesthetic properties, which can soothe irritated mucous membranes in the respiratory tract.

## **Alternate Names**

Prenoxdiazine is also known as Libexin, Prenoxid, and Tibexin (brand names).


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Prenoxdiazine primarily acts on peripheral cough receptors within the respiratory tract. It suppresses the cough reflex by reducing the sensitivity of these receptors to stimuli. Some studies suggest a possible central action on the cough center in the medulla oblongata, but its peripheral action is considered predominant. The drug also displays mild local anesthetic properties, which further contribute to cough suppression by soothing irritated airways.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Prenoxdiazine is administered orally and is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is primarily metabolized in the liver.  The exact metabolic pathways and the involvement of specific CYP enzymes are not completely understood, but liver enzyme inducers may reduce the efficacy of prenoxdiazine. The drug is eliminated through both renal and hepatic pathways.

**Mode of Action:** Prenoxdiazine hydrochloride primarily works by suppressing the cough reflex through its action on peripheral cough receptors in the respiratory tract. Its precise binding sites and molecular interactions remain largely unknown. While it doesn't bind to opioid receptors, it is believed to modulate sensory nerve endings involved in the cough reflex arc.  Additionally, its local anesthetic properties contribute to its soothing effect on the airways.  Exact elimination pathways are not fully elucidated.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

100-200 mg, three to four times daily.  The maximum daily dose is 900 mg.

#### **Children:**

* **1-6 years (10-20 kg):** 25-50 mg, three times daily.
* **6-14 years (>20 kg):** 50 mg, three to four times daily.
* **Over 1 year:** Maximum single dose: Â½ tablet (50mg). Maximum daily dose: 1.5-2 tablets (75-100mg).
* **Under 1 year**: Not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Administer cautiously due to potential reduced hepatic and renal function. Start with lower doses and monitor closely.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Adjust dosage based on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use cautiously. Monitor liver function tests. Dosage adjustments are advised.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is necessary in patients with severe respiratory conditions, liver impairment, or substance abuse history. Adjust dosage accordingly.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Standard adult dosage generally applies. Specific dosages depend on the severity of the cough and individual patient factors.

* **Intubation:**  Can be used as premedication.
* **Surgical Procedures:**  For post-operative cough suppression. Should be avoided after inhalation anesthesia.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:**  To reduce coughing.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  Dose adjustments might be needed, depending on patient condition and comorbidities.
* **Emergency Situations:**  Not typically used for acute emergency cough situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjust based on renal/hepatic function, metabolic disorders, patient response, and other relevant medical factors.  Monitor patient reactions and adjust dosage as required.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Dizziness
* Mild sedation
* Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, constipation, dry mouth)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Liver dysfunction (jaundice, dark urine, abdominal pain)

### **Long-Term Effects**

No significant long-term effects have been reported with appropriate usage. However, prolonged usage necessitates monitoring, especially liver function.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions and signs of liver damage require urgent medical intervention.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to prenoxdiazine or its components
* Excessive bronchial secretions
* Post-operative use after inhalation anesthesia
* Children under 1 year of age

## **Drug Interactions**

* **CNS Depressants:**  Enhanced sedative effects with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or other CNS depressants.
* **Liver Enzyme Inducers:**  Reduced efficacy with phenytoin, rifampicin, and other inducers.
* **Other Cough Suppressants:**  Use with caution to prevent additive adverse effects.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Limited clinical data. Considered relatively safe, but consultation with a healthcare provider is essential.
* **Breastfeeding:** Excretion in breast milk is not fully characterized. Caution is advised, or consider alternatives.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Peripherally acting antitussive, mild central effects, local anesthetic properties.
* **Side Effects:** Dizziness, sedation, GI disturbances, rare allergic reactions, rare liver dysfunction.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, excessive bronchial secretions, post-inhalation anesthesia, age <1 year.
* **Drug Interactions:**  CNS depressants, liver enzyme inducers, other antitussives.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Limited data; use with caution.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 100-200 mg TID-QID. Children:  Age and weight-based.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Liver function (especially long-term), respiratory status.


## **Popular Combinations**

May be combined with expectorants or mucolytics for productive coughs.


## **Precautions**

* **General:**  Screen for allergies, liver/kidney disease.
* **Specific Populations:** Pregnant/breastfeeding women (cautious use), elderly (lower doses).
* **Lifestyle:** Advise patients against driving or operating machinery if experiencing dizziness or sedation.
