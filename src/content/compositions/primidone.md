## **Usage**

Primidone is an anticonvulsant medication primarily prescribed for the management of various types of seizures, including grand mal, psychomotor, and focal seizures. It is also used in the treatment of essential tremor.  Primidone's pharmacological classification is anticonvulsant. Its mechanism of action involves converting to phenobarbital and phenylethylmalonamide (PEMA), both active anticonvulsants. These metabolites enhance the inhibitory effects of GABA, a neurotransmitter that reduces neuronal excitability in the brain.

## **Alternate Names**

Primidone is also known as Mysoline (brand name), Myidone, Sertan and Apo-Primidone.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Primidone, along with its metabolites phenobarbital and PEMA, primarily acts by enhancing the inhibitory effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter in the brain.  This leads to decreased neuronal excitability and helps suppress seizure activity. Primidone may also exert its anticonvulsant effects by altering sodium and calcium channel transport, reducing the frequency of nerve firing.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Primidone is well-absorbed orally, with a bioavailability of up to 80%. It reaches peak plasma concentrations within 2-4 hours.  Primidone is metabolized in the liver to its active metabolites, phenobarbital and PEMA.  Elimination occurs primarily through renal excretion, with a half-life of approximately 8-12 hours. The volume of distribution is 0.5-0.8 L/kg, and protein binding is relatively low (10.78-13.70%).

**Mode of Action:**  Primidone and its metabolites primarily act by potentiating GABAergic neurotransmission.  Phenobarbital binds to the GABA-A receptor, a ligand-gated chloride channel, increasing its sensitivity to GABA.  This enhances chloride influx into neurons, leading to hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Primidone's primary mechanism of action is positive allosteric modulation of the GABA-A receptor through its metabolite, phenobarbital.  It may also antagonize neuronal acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and glutamate receptors.  Its metabolism involves CYP450 enzymes, notably CYP2C9.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Initial:** 100-125 mg orally at bedtime for 3 days.
* **Increase** gradually every 3 days: 100-125 mg twice daily for 3 days, then 100-125 mg three times daily for 3 days.
* **Maintenance:** 250 mg orally three to four times daily (750â€“1500 mg/day). Maximum daily dose: 2 g.
* **Essential Tremor:** 12.5 to 25 mg orally at bedtime initially, increase as tolerated by 25 mg every 3 days or 125 mg/week to 250mg per day maximum. Do not exceed 750mg/day.

#### **Children:**

* **Under 8 years:** Start with 50 mg orally daily at bedtime and gradually increase as tolerated.
* **Maintenance:** 125-250 mg orally three times daily or 10-25 mg/kg/day orally in divided doses.
* **8 years and older:** Follow adult dosing guidelines.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Lower initial doses and slower titration are recommended due to age-related changes in drug metabolism and clearance.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary depending on the degree of impairment. Close monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dose adjustment may be necessary, and close monitoring of liver function is essential.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Dosage adjustments may be required based on specific comorbid conditions and potential drug interactions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Primidone is not typically indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.  Benzodiazepines or other fast-acting anticonvulsants are generally preferred in these settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications should be based on patient-specific factors, including renal or hepatic dysfunction, age, other medical conditions, and concomitant medications. Therapeutic drug monitoring can be helpful in optimizing dosage and minimizing the risk of adverse effects.
