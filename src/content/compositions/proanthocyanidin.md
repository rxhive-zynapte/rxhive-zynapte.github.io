## **Usage**

Proanthocyanidin, a type of flavonoid, is primarily used for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It is often prescribed for conditions like chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), where it helps improve blood flow and reduce symptoms such as swelling, pain, and itching in the legs. It may also be beneficial for managing conditions like diabetic retinopathy, hypertension and for supporting skin and oral health. Proanthocyanidins are classified as vasoprotective agents and antioxidants.  Their mechanism of action involves strengthening capillaries, scavenging free radicals, and reducing inflammation.

## **Alternate Names**

Proanthocyanidin is also known as procyanidin, condensed tannins, oligomeric proanthocyanidin complexes (OPCs), and pycnogenols (specifically derived from pine bark).  Some brand names include ActiVin and Antistax.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Proanthocyanidins exert their effects primarily through potent antioxidant activity, scavenging free radicals and reducing oxidative stress. They also possess anti-inflammatory properties by modulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. In CVI, they strengthen capillary walls, improve venous tone, and reduce vascular permeability, thereby lessening edema and other symptoms.  Additionally, Proanthocyanidins can improve endothelial function and protect against LDL cholesterol oxidation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Proanthocyanidins are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed throughout the body, reaching various tissues including the vascular system. Metabolism and elimination pathways are not fully understood, but some evidence suggests they are metabolized in the liver and excreted through urine and bile.

**Mode of Action:** At the cellular level, Proanthocyanidins protect cells from oxidative damage by scavenging free radicals, inhibiting lipid peroxidation, and chelating metal ions.  They may also modulate enzyme activity and gene expression related to inflammation and vascular function.  Specific receptor binding or neurotransmitter modulation is not well characterized.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

For chronic venous insufficiency, a typical dosage ranges from 150-300 mg per day, often taken in divided doses. For other conditions, the dose may vary.  Some sources suggest 50-100mg for general antioxidant support, increasing with age up to 200mg.  Another regimen involves 75-300mg daily for three weeks, then reducing to a maintenance dose of 40-80mg per day.  For ocular stress reduction, 200-300mg daily is suggested.

#### **Children:**

Limited information is available on pediatric dosing. Consultation with a pediatrician is essential before administration in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual health status and renal/hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be required based on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, and dose adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized dosing should be considered based on the specific comorbidity.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Proanthocyanidin is generally not indicated for acute medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its primary use is in chronic conditions.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications should be made based on individual patient characteristics, including renal and hepatic function, other medical conditions, and concomitant medications.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Gastrointestinal discomfort (e.g., nausea, abdominal pain), headache, and skin rash are among the commonly reported side effects.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Although rare, some individuals may experience allergic reactions or other serious adverse events.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Limited data exist on long-term effects.  However, prolonged high doses of any antioxidant could potentially disrupt the body's natural redox balance.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs are rare but should be monitored.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to proanthocyanidins or related compounds is a contraindication.  Caution should be exercised in patients with bleeding disorders or those scheduled for surgery due to potential blood-thinning effects.

## **Drug Interactions**

Proanthocyanidins may interact with anticoagulants, antihypertensives, and other medications.  They may also affect iron absorption. It is crucial to assess potential interactions based on individual patient medication profiles.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Insufficient data are available regarding the safety of proanthocyanidin during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Therefore, it is generally advised to avoid use in these situations.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, vasoprotective.
* **Side Effects:** Gastrointestinal discomfort, headache, skin rash.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, bleeding disorders.
* **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, antihypertensives.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid.
* **Dosage:** Varies depending on indication and patient factors; typically 150-300mg/day for CVI.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Assess for efficacy based on improvement of target symptoms (e.g. CVI symptoms, blood pressure).  Monitor renal and hepatic function if relevant.

## **Popular Combinations**

No widely established popular drug combinations are specifically associated with proanthocyanidin.

## **Precautions**

General precautions include screening for allergies and pre-existing conditions. Specific populations like pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, and children require extra caution. Lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption and smoking should also be considered.
