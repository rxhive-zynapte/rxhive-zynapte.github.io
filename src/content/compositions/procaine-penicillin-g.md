      How is Procaine Penicillin G different from other penicillins?**


      **A:** Procaine Penicillin G is formulated with procaine for slow,
      sustained release. This creates lower but more persistent serum penicillin
      levels compared to aqueous penicillin G, which is given IV or IM for
      rapid, high serum levels.

## **Usage**

Procaine Penicillin G is an antibiotic belonging to the penicillin class. It is primarily used for treating moderately severe infections caused by penicillin-G-susceptible microorganisms.  These infections often require low and persistent serum levels of penicillin. Specific infections for which Procaine Penicillin G is indicated include: streptococcal infections (Groups A, C, G, H, L, and M),  some staphylococcal infections, fusospirochetosis (caused by fusiform bacilli and spirochetes), diphtheria (in conjunction with antitoxin), syphilis (all stages), yaws, bejel, pinta, anthrax, and rat-bite fever. It is important to note that Procaine Penicillin G is not recommended for the initial treatment of severe pneumococcal infections or for prophylaxis against bacterial endocarditis. For those conditions, other forms of penicillin are preferred.

Its pharmacological classification is **beta-lactam antibiotic**.

The mechanism of action of Procaine Penicillin G involves inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to and inactivating penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This weakens the bacterial cell wall, leading to cell lysis and death.


## **Alternate Names**

Procaine Penicillin G is also known as APPG, Benzylpenicillin Procaine, and Procaine Benzylpenicillin. Brand names include Duracillin A-S, Pfizerpen A-S, Wycillin, and Crysticillin. Bicillin C-R contains Procaine Penicillin G combined with Penicillin G Benzathine.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Procaine Penicillin G exerts its bactericidal effect by disrupting the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls.  This leads to cell wall instability and eventual lysis of the bacteria.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Administered intramuscularly (IM), Procaine Penicillin G is absorbed slowly, achieving peak serum concentrations within 12–24 hours post-injection. The procaine component provides a slow, sustained release of penicillin into the bloodstream.
* **Metabolism:** Procaine Penicillin G is metabolized to penicillin G and procaine.
* **Elimination:** Penicillin G is primarily eliminated by the kidneys via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Probenecid can compete with penicillin for tubular secretion, thereby increasing penicillin's serum half-life. Procaine is metabolized by plasma esterases and also excreted renally.

**Mode of Action:** Procaine Penicillin G inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by irreversibly binding to and inactivating PBPs. This disrupts the cross-linking of peptidoglycan strands, leading to a weakened cell wall and bacterial death.

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation**: The primary mechanism is the  inhibition of PBPs, which are bacterial enzymes crucial for cell wall synthesis.

**Elimination pathways**: Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

Procaine Penicillin G is administered intramuscularly (IM) only. It should not be administered intravenously (IV), subcutaneously (SC), or intrathecally (IT).  Dosage depends on the infection being treated and patient factors.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* The usual adult dose ranges from 600,000 to 1,200,000 units IM once or twice daily. For syphilis, 600,000 units IM daily is common.

#### **Children:**

* Dosing for children varies according to age and weight: For infants under 2 kg: 50,000 units/kg IM once daily. For children between 2 kg and 27 kg: 300,000 units IM once daily for 10-14 days or 25,000-50,000 units/kg/day IM divided every 12-24 hours. For children over 27 kg: 600,000 to 1,200,000 units IM once daily. For children aged 1 month or older: 50,000 units/kg/day IM divided into one or two doses (maximum 1.2 million units/day) for 14 days.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Age-related renal impairment may necessitate dosage adjustments. Monitoring renal function is recommended.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment is essential for patients with creatinine clearance less than 10 mL/min/1.73m². A full loading dose followed by half the loading dose every 8–10 hours is a common adjustment. For patients with creatinine clearance greater than 10 mL/min/1.73m², a full loading dose followed by half the loading dose every 4–5 hours is often used.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments for hepatic dysfunction are typically required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider comorbidities, especially allergies and asthma.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosages for the listed clinical use cases are not specifically defined for Procaine Penicillin G but may be within the general range. Consult specialized literature and guidelines for appropriate antibiotic use in these settings. Procaine Penicillin G is usually not the first-line treatment choice for severe or acute infections, particularly in intensive care or emergency situations.

* **Intubation:**  Not typically indicated.
* **Surgical Procedures:**  Not typically indicated for prophylaxis.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:**  Not typically indicated.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  Not typically the preferred penicillin for ICU settings.
* **Emergency Situations:** Not typically indicated.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage modifications are needed for renal impairment (see above). Consider adjustments for other conditions based on patient-specific factors.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, pain, swelling, or bruising at the injection site, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, drowsiness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing or swallowing, swelling of the face, throat, or tongue), severe diarrhea,  neurovascular damage (if injected near a nerve or artery), seizures, hallucinations, cardiac effects. Methemoglobinemia (cyanosis, abnormal blood coloration), serum sickness (fever, joint pain, rash).

### **Long-Term Effects**

With prolonged use: low white blood cell count, serum sickness.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Anaphylaxis (requiring immediate medical attention), Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (when treating syphilis).


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to penicillin or procaine.

## **Drug Interactions**

Tetracyclines (antagonistic effect), Probenecid (increased penicillin levels), some other antibiotics (e.g., aminosalicylic acid), anticoagulants (potential increased bleeding risk), oral contraceptives (efficacy may be reduced). See a drug interaction database for a complete list of interactions.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category (old FDA classification):  Not assigned (new system in place), previously Category B.  Generally considered safe to use during pregnancy but should only be used if clearly needed.

Drug excretion in breast milk is minimal and generally considered safe for breastfeeding. Monitor infant for signs of thrush or diarrhea.
