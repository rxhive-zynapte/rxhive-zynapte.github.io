## **Usage**

Procarbazine is an antineoplastic agent, specifically an alkylating agent, primarily used in combination chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of stage III and IV Hodgkin lymphoma (Hodgkin's disease).  It is often part of the BEACOPP, COPP, and MOPP regimens. While it has shown some activity against other malignancies like brain tumors, its use in these conditions is limited.

## **Alternate Names**

* International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Procarbazine
* Chemical name:  N-isopropyl-α-(2-methylhydrazino)-p-toluamide monohydrochloride
* Brand name: Matulane

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Procarbazine exerts its cytotoxic effects through multiple mechanisms, primarily alkylation of DNA and RNA.  This leads to DNA strand breaks, inhibiting DNA and RNA synthesis, ultimately causing cell death. It also has some monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) activity.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Procarbazine is well-absorbed orally. It undergoes extensive metabolism in the liver, including by CYP450 enzymes, to several active metabolites, including azo-procarbazine and isopropylcarbazic acid.  Elimination is primarily through renal excretion, with some hepatic elimination.

**Mode of Action:** Procarbazine acts as an alkylating agent by forming reactive species that covalently bind to DNA and RNA, resulting in DNA strand breaks, which subsequently inhibit nucleic acid synthesis.  Its MAOI activity contributes to its side effect profile.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Procarbazine's primary mechanism is DNA alkylation.  Its MAOI activity inhibits the enzyme monoamine oxidase, which metabolizes neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Procarbazine and its metabolites are eliminated primarily via the kidneys, with some hepatic excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Single Agent:**
    * Initial: 2-4 mg/kg/day orally for one week.
    * Maintenance: 4-6 mg/kg/day until maximum response or toxicity (WBC < 4000/mm³, platelets < 100,000/mm³).  Reduce to 1-2 mg/kg/day after maximum response.

* **Combination Regimens (e.g., MOPP):**  100 mg/m²/day orally for 7-14 days of each 28-day cycle, adjusted based on concomitant medications.

#### **Children:**

* 50 mg/m²/day orally for the first week.
* Increase to 100 mg/m²/day until maximum response or toxicity.
* Maintenance dose: 50 mg/m²/day.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution and close monitoring; adjust dose based on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution, adjust dose as necessary based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution, adjust dose as necessary based on liver function tests.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Procarbazine is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU care, or emergency situations. Its primary use is in the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on hematologic toxicity, renal function, hepatic function, and concomitant medications.  Close monitoring of blood counts and organ function is crucial during procarbazine therapy.
