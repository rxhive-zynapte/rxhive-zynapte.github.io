## **Usage**

Prochlorperazine is prescribed for the management of:

* **Severe nausea and vomiting:**  This includes nausea and vomiting associated with surgery, chemotherapy, and gastroenteritis.
* **Schizophrenia:** Prochlorperazine helps manage psychotic symptoms like hallucinations and delusions.
* **Generalized non-psychotic anxiety:**  It's important to note that this is not a first-line treatment for anxiety and usage should be limited to low doses for short periods (less than 20 mg/day or 12 weeks).
* **Vertigo and dizziness** associated with inner ear disorders like Meniere's disease.
* **Migraine:**  (off-label use)

**Pharmacological Classification:** Prochlorperazine is a first-generation antipsychotic (also known as a typical antipsychotic or neuroleptic) belonging to the phenothiazine class.  It also possesses antiemetic properties.

**Mechanism of Action:** Prochlorperazine primarily acts as a dopamine receptor antagonist, blocking dopamine D2 receptors in the brain. This action is responsible for its antipsychotic and antiemetic effects.  It also exhibits anticholinergic, antihistaminic, and antiadrenergic properties, contributing to its clinical effects and side effect profile.


## **Alternate Names**

* **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Prochlorperazine
* **Other Names:** Prochlorperazine maleate, prochlorperazine mesylate, prochlorperazine edisylate (depending on the specific salt form)

**Brand Names:**  Compazine, Stemetil, Buccastem, and various generic formulations are available.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Prochlorperazine's effects are primarily mediated through dopamine D2 receptor antagonism in various brain regions.  This leads to:

* **Antipsychotic Effect:** Reduced dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway, alleviating positive symptoms of schizophrenia.
* **Antiemetic Effect:**  Dopamine receptor blockade in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the medulla oblongata suppresses nausea and vomiting.
* **Other Effects:** The drug's anticholinergic, antihistaminic, and alpha-adrenergic blocking properties contribute to its side effect profile.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Well-absorbed orally, rectally, and intramuscularly.  Oral bioavailability is relatively low due to first-pass metabolism.
* **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6.
* **Elimination:** Excreted in urine and feces as metabolites.

**Mode of Action:** Prochlorperazine binds to and blocks dopamine D2 receptors, preventing dopamine from binding and exerting its effects. This results in decreased dopaminergic neurotransmission.

**Receptor Binding:** Primarily a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist. Also exhibits some affinity for other receptors, including alpha-adrenergic, histamine H1, and muscarinic cholinergic receptors.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism followed by renal and biliary excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral:** 5-10 mg every 6-8 hours, not exceeding 150 mg/day. Extended-release: 10 mg every 12 hours or 15 mg every morning.
* **Intramuscular:** 5-10 mg every 3-4 hours, not exceeding 40 mg/day.
* **Intravenous:** 2.5-10 mg every 3-4 hours, not exceeding 10 mg/dose or 40 mg/day (administer slowly).
* **Rectal Suppository:** 25 mg every 12 hours.


#### **Children (over 2 years of age):**

Dosing is based on weight and requires careful titration. Generally starting at 2.5 mg one to three times daily, not exceeding specific weight-based limits. Use in children under 2 years is generally not recommended.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Lower starting doses are recommended due to increased sensitivity to side effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be needed in severe renal dysfunction.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dose reduction may be required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution and dose adjustments may be needed in patients with cardiovascular disease, seizure disorders, etc.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:** Prochlorperazine can be used for pre- and postoperative nausea and vomiting prevention and management.  Dosage and route of administration depend on the specific clinical situation.
* **Emergency Situations:** May be used in emergency settings for the management of severe nausea and vomiting or acute agitation.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are crucial in:

* **Renal/Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Reduced doses are typically necessary.
* **Metabolic Disorders:**  Consider patient-specific factors.
* **Genetic Polymorphisms:** Patients with certain CYP2D6 variations may have altered drug metabolism.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness
* Dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation
* Nasal congestion
* Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS): tremors, restlessness, muscle stiffness or spasms (dystonia), parkinsonism

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS):  high fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status
* Tardive dyskinesia: involuntary movements of the face, tongue, and limbs
* Agranulocytosis: low white blood cell count
* Seizures
* Severe allergic reactions

### **Long-Term Effects:**

* Tardive dyskinesia can become permanent if not addressed promptly.
* Metabolic changes, including weight gain and dyslipidemia, may occur with prolonged use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any signs of NMS, tardive dyskinesia, agranulocytosis, or severe allergic reactions require immediate discontinuation of the drug and supportive medical care.

## **Drug Interactions**

Prochlorperazine interacts with numerous medications, including:
