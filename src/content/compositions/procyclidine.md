## Usage

Procyclidine is prescribed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease symptoms (such as tremor, stiffness, difficulty moving) and drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which are movement disorders caused by certain antipsychotic medications.  It falls under the pharmacological classification of anticholinergics. Procyclidine works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, in the central nervous system. This helps to rebalance the levels of dopamine and acetylcholine, reducing the motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease and EPS.

## Alternate Names

Procyclidine hydrochloride is the generic name. A common brand name is Kemadrin.

## How It Works

**Pharmacodynamics:** Procyclidine primarily exerts its therapeutic effect by competitively antagonizing muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, particularly M1 receptors in the central nervous system. By blocking these receptors, procyclidine helps to restore the balance between dopaminergic and cholinergic activity, thus alleviating Parkinsonian symptoms and drug-induced EPS.  It also has some direct antispasmodic and antihistaminic properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Procyclidine is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. Taking the medication with food can enhance absorption.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver.
* **Elimination:** Excreted primarily in the urine. The elimination half-life is long enough to permit twice-daily dosing.

**Mode of Action:**  Procyclidine acts as a competitive antagonist at muscarinic M1 receptors.  This action reduces the excessive cholinergic activity that contributes to motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease and drug-induced EPS.

**Elimination pathways:** Hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.

## Dosage


### Standard Dosage

#### Adults:

* **Parkinson's Disease:**  Initial dose is 2.5 mg three times a day, after meals.  The dose can be increased gradually by 2.5-5 mg every 2-3 days, as needed and tolerated, to a maximum of 60 mg per day (divided into 3-4 doses). The usual maintenance dose ranges from 15-30 mg per day. A fourth dose at bedtime may be beneficial for some patients.
* **Drug-induced EPS:** Initial dose is 2.5 mg three times a day. The dose can be increased by 2.5 mg daily until symptoms are relieved. Usual maintenance dose is 10-30 mg per day, divided into doses.

#### Children:

Procyclidine is generally not recommended for children.  If used, careful monitoring and dose adjustment are crucial. Safety and efficacy in children haven't been definitively established.

#### Special Cases:

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose due to increased sensitivity to anticholinergic side effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment might be necessary. Closely monitor for adverse effects.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction may be required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, gastrointestinal or urinary obstruction, and myasthenia gravis.

### Clinical Use Cases

The dosage recommendations for the specific clinical use cases you mentioned (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, Emergency Situations) for procyclidine are not available as it's not typically indicated in those settings. Procyclidine is primarily used for the management of Parkinsonian symptoms and drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms.

### Dosage Adjustments

Dose modifications are necessary based on patient-specific factors, including renal/hepatic dysfunction and individual response.  Slow titration upwards is important.

## Side Effects

### Common Side Effects

Dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, nervousness.

### Rare but Serious Side Effects

Confusion, hallucinations, difficulty urinating, rapid heartbeat,  severe allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling), eye pain/swelling/redness, vision changes.

### Long-Term Effects

Cognitive impairment, worsening of glaucoma, urinary retention, decreased sweating.

### Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)

Severe allergic reactions, cardiac effects, acute angle-closure glaucoma, paralytic ileus.

## Contraindications

Absolute contraindications include known hypersensitivity to procyclidine,  untreated urinary retention, angle-closure glaucoma,  myasthenia gravis,  and gastrointestinal obstruction.

## Drug Interactions

Procyclidine interacts with numerous medications including other anticholinergics (e.g., antihistamines, tricyclic antidepressants), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs),  antipsychotics, some medications for diarrhea (e.g. kaolin, pectin), ketoconazole, and antacids containing magnesium, aluminum, or calcium. These interactions can enhance anticholinergic effects or reduce the absorption of procyclidine. Alcohol can exacerbate drowsiness and dizziness.

## Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

The safety of procyclidine during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been definitively established. Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus or infant.  It's unknown if procyclidine passes into breast milk.

## Drug Profile Summary

* **Mechanism of Action:** Anticholinergic, antagonizes muscarinic M1 receptors.
* **Side Effects:** Dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, dizziness, confusion, hallucinations.
* **Contraindications:** Angle-closure glaucoma, urinary retention, GI obstruction, myasthenia gravis.
* **Drug Interactions:** Numerous, including other anticholinergics, MAOIs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution; safety not established.
* **Dosage:** Varies depending on indication and patient response. See detailed dosage section.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for anticholinergic side effects, EPS symptoms, and Parkinsonian symptoms.

## Popular Combinations

Procyclidine can be used in combination with levodopa or amantadine in Parkinson's disease patients who are not adequately controlled with a single agent. However, the combination requires careful dose adjustments.

## Precautions

* **General Precautions:** Screen for allergies, glaucoma, urinary retention, and GI obstruction. Monitor vital signs and cognitive function.
* **Specific Populations:**  Caution in elderly and pregnant/breastfeeding women. Not recommended for children.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Limit alcohol intake. Avoid overheating. Advise patients to avoid operating machinery if experiencing dizziness or blurred vision.
