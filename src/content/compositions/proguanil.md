## **Usage**

Proguanil is primarily prescribed for the **prevention and treatment of malaria**, specifically caused by *Plasmodium falciparum*. It belongs to the **antimalarial** pharmacological class.  Proguanil acts as a **dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor** in the malaria parasite, disrupting its folate metabolism and consequently, DNA synthesis. Proguanil is a **pro-drug** which is metabolized to its active form, cycloguanil.


## **Alternate Names**

- **Chlorguanide**
- **Paludrine** (brand name)

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Proguanil is a pro-drug metabolized to cycloguanil in the liver. Cycloguanil inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) in the malaria parasite, a crucial enzyme in the folate pathway responsible for DNA synthesis. This inhibition interrupts parasite growth and multiplication, thus exerting antimalarial effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
- **Absorption:** Proguanil is well-absorbed orally, especially when taken with food.
- **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by CYP2C19 in the liver to its active metabolite, cycloguanil.
- **Elimination:** Both proguanil and cycloguanil are excreted primarily in the urine, with a half-life of approximately 12-25 hours for proguanil and 16-20 hours for cycloguanil.

**Mode of Action:** Cycloguanil's primary mechanism of action is through the **inhibition of DHFR**, which disrupts the folate metabolic pathway crucial for pyrimidine biosynthesis, essential for DNA replication and cell division in the parasite.

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**
- **Enzyme Inhibition:** Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibition in *Plasmodium falciparum*.


**Elimination pathways:** Primarily **renal excretion** of both proguanil and its active metabolite cycloguanil.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (for Prophylaxis):**  200 mg daily (two 100 mg tablets).

#### **Children (for Prophylaxis):**
- **Under 1 year:** 25 mg daily.
- **1 to 4 years:** 50 mg daily.
- **5 to 8 years:** 100 mg daily.
- **9 to 14 years:** 150 mg daily.
- **Over 14 years:** Adult dose (200mg) daily.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment generally necessary, but monitor for potential adverse effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution advised in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min); dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is typically needed for mild to moderate impairment. Severe hepatic impairment may warrant precaution and potential dose adjustment.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  
Proguanil itself is not typically used in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations like cardiac arrest. It is mainly used for malaria prophylaxis.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
- **Renal/hepatic dysfunction:** As above
- **Metabolic disorders/genetic polymorphisms:** Monitor individuals with CYP2C19 polymorphisms.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Abdominal pain
- Headache
- Mouth ulcers


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Severe skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome)
- Blood disorders (e.g., pancytopenia)
- Hepatotoxicity


### **Long-Term Effects**  Long-term use is generally safe, but potential adverse effects should be monitored.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
- Angioedema
- Anaphylaxis


## **Contraindications**
- Hypersensitivity to proguanil.
- Severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min).


## **Drug Interactions**
- **Warfarin:** Proguanil may increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.
- **Metoclopramide:** May decrease the efficacy of proguanil.
- **Tetracyclines:** May decrease the efficacy of proguanil.
- **CYP2C19 inhibitors/inducers:** May affect proguanil metabolism.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** It can be used during pregnancy if the benefits outweigh the risks, particularly if there are no suitable alternatives.
- **Breastfeeding:** Can be used during breastfeeding for infants weighing >5 kg. However, the infant will require separate malaria prophylaxis.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits dihydrofolate reductase in *Plasmodium falciparum*.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, mouth ulcers. Rare: Severe skin reactions, blood disorders, hepatotoxicity.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe renal impairment.
- **Drug Interactions:** Warfarin, metoclopramide, tetracyclines, CYP2C19 inhibitors/inducers.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Generally safe if benefits outweigh risks. Infant requires independent prophylaxis.
- **Dosage:** Prophylaxis: Adults: 200 mg daily. Children: Weight/age-based dosing.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function, liver function tests, complete blood count (if long-term use), signs of adverse reactions.

## **Popular Combinations**

- **Atovaquone:** The combination atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone) is frequently used for both malaria prophylaxis and treatment. They have synergistic effects and are highly effective against chloroquine-resistant malaria.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Renal/hepatic function assessment.
- **Specific Populations:** Pregnant/breastfeeding women: Assess risk-benefit. Children: Monitor weight/age-based dosing.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:**  No specific lifestyle restrictions.
