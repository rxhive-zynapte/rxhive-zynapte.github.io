## **Usage**

Promethazine is primarily prescribed for the management of various conditions, including:

* **Allergic conditions:** Allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, urticaria (hives), and angioedema.
* **Nausea and vomiting:**  Postoperative, motion sickness, and chemotherapy-induced.
* **Motion sickness:** Prevention and treatment.
* **Sedation:** Preoperative and postoperative, insomnia.

**Pharmacological Classifications:**

* Antihistamine (H1 receptor antagonist)
* Antiemetic
* Sedative/Hypnotic

**Mechanism of Action:** Promethazine exerts its effects through multiple pathways:

* **H1 receptor antagonism:** Blocks the effects of histamine, reducing allergic symptoms.
* **Anticholinergic activity:** Inhibits acetylcholine, contributing to its drying and sedative effects.
* **Dopamine receptor antagonism:** Blocks dopamine receptors, reducing nausea and vomiting.
* **Alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade:** Contributes to its sedative and hypotensive effects.



## **Alternate Names**

Promethazine hydrochloride


**Brand Names:** Phenergan, Promethegan, Avomine (in some regions)


## **How It Works**


**Pharmacodynamics:**  Promethazine's effects are primarily mediated by H1 receptor antagonism, anticholinergic activity, dopamine receptor antagonism, and alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Well-absorbed after oral administration.
* **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver via CYP450 enzymes (primarily CYP2D6).
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through renal excretion (urine) as metabolites.


**Mode of Action:**
* **Receptor Binding:** Antagonist at H1 histamine receptors, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, dopamine D2 receptors, and alpha-adrenergic receptors.


**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of metabolites.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Allergy:** 12.5-25 mg orally every 4-6 hours or 25 mg at bedtime as needed. Maximum daily dose: 100 mg.
* **Nausea/Vomiting:** 12.5-25 mg orally every 4-6 hours as needed. Maximum daily dose: 100 mg.
* **Motion Sickness:** 25 mg orally 30-60 minutes before travel, then every 8-12 hours as needed.
* **Sedation:** 25-50 mg orally at bedtime.

#### **Children:**
* **>2 years:** Dosage varies depending on indication and weight. Consult specific pediatric guidelines. Promethazine is contraindicated in children under 2 years old.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses due to increased sensitivity.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution advised; dose adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution advised; dose adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized dosing based on specific condition and potential drug interactions.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Intubation:**  Promethazine is sometimes used as an adjunct to pre-anesthetic medication.
* **Surgical Procedures:** Used pre- and postoperatively for sedation, nausea, and vomiting control.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not specifically indicated.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  May be used for nausea and vomiting control; caution is advised.
* **Emergency Situations:** Generally not recommended.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are necessary based on patient factors like renal or hepatic dysfunction, drug interactions, and individual response.  Always start with the lowest effective dose and titrate as needed.

* **Epilepsy Medications:** May lower seizure threshold.




## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  FDA Category C. Use only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Small amounts may be excreted in breast milk.  Monitor infant for drowsiness and reduced milk production. If using short term, observe babies for excessive sedation.



## **Drug Profile Summary**
