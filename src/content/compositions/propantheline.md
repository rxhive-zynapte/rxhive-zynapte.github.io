## Usage

Propantheline is an antimuscarinic agent, primarily prescribed as adjunctive therapy for peptic ulcers (gastric and duodenal). It also helps manage symptoms of gastritis and other conditions characterized by gastrointestinal spasms, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  It can also be used to treat hyperhidrosis and adult enuresis. It falls under the pharmacological classifications of anticholinergic, antimuscarinic, antispasmodic, and antisecretory agents.

Propantheline's mechanism of action involves competitively inhibiting the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, particularly in the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts. This inhibition reduces smooth muscle motility and decreases gastric acid secretion.

## Alternate Names

Propantheline bromide is the official chemical name. A common brand name is Pro-Banthine®.

## How It Works

**Pharmacodynamics:** Propantheline exerts its effects by blocking the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors located on smooth muscle cells and secretory glands throughout the body. By antagonizing acetylcholine's effects, Propantheline reduces smooth muscle spasms, diminishes gastric acid secretion, decreases motility in the gastrointestinal tract, and reduces secretions from other glands, such as salivary and sweat glands.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Propantheline is administered orally and is incompletely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  Peak plasma concentrations are reached in about one hour. It is extensively metabolized, mainly in the liver by hydrolysis, to inactive metabolites. Propantheline's elimination half-life is around 1.6 hours. Approximately 70% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine, primarily as metabolites, with about 3% excreted unchanged.

**Mode of Action:**  Propantheline acts as a competitive antagonist at muscarinic receptors, specifically the M1, M2, and M3 subtypes. These receptors are found in the exocrine glands, smooth muscles, cardiac muscles, and central nervous system. This blockade leads to a decrease in the effects of the parasympathetic nervous system.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Propantheline's primary mechanism is competitive antagonism of muscarinic receptors, reducing the effects of acetylcholine. It does not directly inhibit enzymes or modulate neurotransmitter release, except for its indirect effect on acetylcholine's actions.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion (70% of the dose, mostly as metabolites) and hepatic metabolism (hydrolysis).

## Dosage

### Standard Dosage

#### Adults:

The initial dose is typically 15 mg orally, taken 30 minutes before meals, three times a day, and 30 mg at bedtime (totaling 75 mg daily).  The dose can be adjusted based on individual response and tolerance, up to a maximum of 120 mg daily. For milder conditions, an initial dose of 7.5 mg three times a day may suffice.

#### Children:

Safety and efficacy in children have not been established, and its use is generally not recommended. However, some limited sources suggest a dose of 2–3 mg/kg/day orally, divided every 4–6 hours, with a maximum of 120 mg/day. Pediatric use requires careful consideration of potential risks and benefits.

#### Special Cases:

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose (e.g., 7.5 mg three times daily) and titrate cautiously, monitoring for adverse effects.  The maximum dose in the elderly should not exceed 30 mg every 8 hours.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Use with caution and consider dose reduction.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution and consider dose reduction.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, or Down syndrome.

### Clinical Use Cases

Propantheline's use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU care, and emergencies is not routinely indicated. Its primary role is in managing peptic ulcers and gastrointestinal spasms. However, it might be used off-label in specific situations under careful medical supervision, and its use for these clinical situations has not been extensively studied or standardized.

### Dosage Adjustments

Dose adjustments are based on patient-specific factors such as age, renal or hepatic function, concomitant medications, and clinical response. Titrate cautiously to the lowest effective dose to minimize side effects.


## Side Effects

### Common Side Effects

* Dry mouth
* Blurred vision
* Constipation
* Urinary hesitancy
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Drowsiness
* Decreased sweating


### Rare but Serious Side Effects

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
* Tachycardia
* Palpitations
* Eye pain
* Difficulty urinating
* Confusion (especially in the elderly)
* Heat prostration (in hot environments)


### Long-Term Effects

Chronic use may lead to dependence and tolerance.  Long-term use might suppress lactation. Monitor patients for these effects.

### Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)

Clinically significant ADRs include severe allergic reactions, acute urinary retention, angle-closure glaucoma, paralytic ileus, and cardiac arrhythmias.  Immediate intervention is necessary if these occur.

## Contraindications

* Hypersensitivity to propantheline or other anticholinergics
* Angle-closure glaucoma
* Obstructive gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., pyloric stenosis, achalasia, paralytic ileus)
* Obstructive uropathy (e.g., prostatic hypertrophy)
* Myasthenia gravis
* Unstable cardiovascular status in acute hemorrhage
* Severe ulcerative colitis or toxic megacolon

## Drug Interactions

Propantheline interacts with several medications, including:

* Other anticholinergics (additive effects)
* Antacids (decreased propantheline absorption)
* Ketoconazole, levodopa (decreased absorption of these drugs)
* Digoxin (increased digoxin levels)
* Antihistamines, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants (increased anticholinergic effects)
* Alcohol (increased drowsiness)


## Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  C (US FDA) and B2 (AU TGA).  Use only if clearly needed and the benefit outweighs the risk. Animal studies suggest a potential for minor malformations.
* **Breastfeeding:** Limited information suggests excretion in breast milk is minimal. However, caution is advised. Monitor infants for potential effects, including decreased lactation.

## Drug Profile Summary

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Muscarinic receptor antagonist, reducing smooth muscle spasms and secretions.
* **Side Effects:** Dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary hesitancy, dizziness.  Rarely: allergic reactions, tachycardia, eye pain, difficulty urinating, confusion.
* **Contraindications:** Glaucoma, GI obstruction, urinary obstruction, myasthenia gravis.
* **Drug Interactions:** Other anticholinergics, antacids, ketoconazole, levodopa, digoxin.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; potential for fetal risks and reduced lactation.

## Popular Combinations

There is no universally popular drug combination using propantheline; it is typically used as adjunctive therapy.

## Precautions

* **General Precautions:** Evaluate for pre-existing conditions like glaucoma, urinary or GI obstruction, myasthenia gravis.
* **Specific Populations:** Use caution in elderly patients and those with hepatic or renal dysfunction. Not recommended for children.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** May impair driving or operating machinery due to drowsiness or blurred vision. Avoid alcohol.
