## **Usage**

Proteases are enzymes that break down proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids.  In medical practice, proteases are used for various purposes, including as digestive aids, anti-inflammatory agents, and in debridement of wounds.

They are classified as proteolytic enzymes.  Their mechanism of action involves the hydrolysis of peptide bonds within proteins.

## **Alternate Names**

Proteolytic enzymes, peptidases. Brand names for combination products containing proteases include Creon, Zenpep, Pancreaze, Pertzye. Individual proteases like bromelain and papain are also available as supplements.


## **How It Works**

### Pharmacodynamics

Proteases exert their therapeutic effects primarily through the breakdown of proteins. For example, in pancreatic insufficiency, they facilitate the digestion of dietary proteins, improving nutrient absorption.  In wound debridement, they break down necrotic tissue. In other conditions, they can modulate the inflammatory response by cleaving specific proteins involved in inflammation.

### Pharmacokinetics

Orally administered proteases are absorbed primarily in the small intestine. Absorption can be enhanced when taken on an empty stomach.  Proteases are metabolized throughout the body, with specific inhibitors present in the blood and body fluids to regulate their activity and prevent them from digesting the body's own proteins.  Elimination pathways vary depending on the specific protease.

### Mode of Action

Proteases act by binding to specific peptide bonds within proteins and catalyzing their hydrolysis. This can result in the activation or inactivation of target proteins, depending on the specific protease and its substrate.

## **Dosage**

Dosage recommendations vary depending on the specific protease, its formulation, and the indication for use. As a general guideline, for digestive support:

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Bromelain: 1200-2000 GDU (gelatin digesting units)
- Fungal protease: 100,000-200,000 HUT (hemoglobin units on tyrosine base)
- Nattokinase: 2000-4000 FIP (fibrin degradation product-inducing units)
- Papain: 3,000,000-6,000,000 PU (papain units)
- Serrapeptase: 80,000-160,000 SPU (serrapeptase units)

These are general measures of potency for individual proteases. For combination products, refer to the product label.  For digestive purposes, take with meals. For other indications, take on an empty stomach.

#### **Children:**

Consult a healthcare professional for pediatric dosing.

#### **Special Cases:**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, elderly patients, or those with comorbid conditions. Consult a healthcare professional for specific recommendations.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical situations like intubation, surgical procedures, or ICU use would pertain to specific protease inhibitors (e.g., ulinastatin) used in critical care settings, not digestive enzyme supplements.  Refer to individual drug monographs for such cases.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dose modifications should be considered for renal or hepatic dysfunction and other relevant factors based on individual patient assessment and the specific protease used.


## **Side Effects**

Side effects can vary depending on the specific protease.

### **Common Side Effects**

Gastrointestinal discomfort, such as nausea, diarrhea, gas, and bloating, can occur, especially with high doses. Allergic reactions are possible.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Severe allergic reactions are rare but require immediate medical attention.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Limited information is available on the long-term effects of protease supplementation.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs are uncommon but warrant immediate intervention.

## **Contraindications**

Contraindications depend on the specific protease.  Generally, protease supplements should be avoided in individuals with known hypersensitivity to the specific enzyme. Some proteases may interact with anticoagulants.

## **Drug Interactions**

Proteases may interact with certain medications, including anticoagulants and blood thinners. Consult a healthcare professional regarding specific drug interactions.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Consult a healthcare professional before using protease supplements during pregnancy or breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Hydrolysis of peptide bonds in proteins.
- **Side Effects:** GI discomfort, allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to the enzyme, certain medical conditions.
- **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, other medications.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult a healthcare professional.

## **Popular Combinations**

Proteases are often combined with other digestive enzymes, such as amylase and lipase, in digestive enzyme supplements.

## **Precautions**

Patients with pre-existing medical conditions should consult a healthcare professional before using protease supplements. Exercise caution in pregnant or breastfeeding women, children, and the elderly.
