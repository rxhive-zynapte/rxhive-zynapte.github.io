## **Usage**

Psoralen, combined with ultraviolet A (UVA) light (PUVA therapy), is prescribed for treating:
* **Psoriasis:**  A chronic skin condition causing red, scaly patches.
* **Vitiligo:** A skin disease resulting in loss of skin color (depigmentation).
* **Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL):** A type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma affecting the skin.
* **Eczema:** (Atopic Dermatitis) A condition that makes skin red and itchy.
* **Other skin conditions:**  Such as scleroderma, and some types of dermatitis.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Photosensitizing medication.

**Mechanism of Action:** Psoralen increases the skin's sensitivity to UVA light.  When activated by UVA exposure, psoralen interacts with DNA, leading to cross-linking and cell damage.  This initiates an inflammatory response and increases melanin production, darkening the skin and thickening the stratum corneum (outermost skin layer).

## **Alternate Names**

* **Methoxsalen** (most common alternate name and active ingredient in many formulations)
* **8-Methoxypsoralen** (8-MOP)
* **Furocoumarin** (chemical class)

**Brand Names:**
* Oxsoralen-Ultra
* Uvadex
* 8-MOP (generic)
* Chromalin 10
* Meladerm
* Melanocyl
* Melcyl
* Melonil
* Manaderm


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Psoralen enhances the effects of UVA radiation on the skin, inducing phototoxic reactions that modify immune responses, cell growth, and pigmentation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:**  Oral psoralen is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  Topical absorption depends on the formulation and application site.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily hepatic metabolism via cytochrome P450 enzymes.
* **Elimination:** Mainly renal excretion.

**Mode of Action:** Psoralen intercalates into DNA.  Upon UVA exposure, it forms covalent bonds with pyrimidine bases (thymine and cytosine), creating DNA cross-links. This disrupts DNA replication and transcription, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (programmed cell death) in rapidly dividing cells like those in psoriatic plaques or malignant T-cells.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** The primary mechanism is not receptor-mediated, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation. Instead, psoralen acts directly on DNA by forming cross-links.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Predominantly renal excretion, along with some hepatic metabolism by CYP450 enzymes.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral (for psoriasis, CTCL, vitiligo):**  Methoxsalen: 0.6 mg/kg (for hard gelatin capsules) or 0.4 mg/kg (for soft gelatin capsules) taken 1.5-4 hours before UVA exposure, 2-3 times per week, with at least 48 hours between treatments.  For vitiligo: 20 mg taken 2-4 hours before UVA exposure.  Dosage can be adjusted based on skin type, body surface area, and individual response. Dosing for mycosis fungoides is 0.6 mg/kg.
* **Topical (for vitiligo):** Apply to affected skin 1-2 minutes before, and then again 2-2.5 hours before UVA exposure.

#### **Children:**

* Dosing must be determined by a doctor and depends on body weight, age, and condition.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Close monitoring is recommended.  Dosage adjustments might be necessary due to age-related changes in organ function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustments are required based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Careful monitoring and dose reduction may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Individualized dosing is required, especially for patients with conditions affecting drug metabolism or photosensitivity.


### **Clinical Use Cases:**

Psoralen's clinical use is primarily centered around photochemotherapy (PUVA) or photopheresis. It is not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dosage adjustments are individualized based on the patient's weight, body surface area, skin type, response to treatment, concurrent medications, and any existing renal or hepatic impairment.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  C (oral),  Not established (topical)
* **Fetal Risks:**  Psoralen is considered teratogenic in animal studies, but limited data exists for humans. Its use is generally contraindicated during pregnancy due to the potential for birth defects and developmental issues.
* **Breastfeeding:** Psoralen is excreted in breast milk and may cause photosensitivity in infants. Breastfeeding is contraindicated during PUVA therapy.
