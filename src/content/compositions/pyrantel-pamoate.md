## **Usage**

Pyrantel Pamoate is prescribed for the treatment of intestinal worm infections, specifically:

* **Enterobiasis (Pinworm Infection):**  This is the most common use of Pyrantel Pamoate.
* **Ascariasis (Roundworm Infection):**  Caused by *Ascaris lumbricoides*.
* **Hookworm Infections (Ancylostomiasis and Necatoriasis):** Caused by *Ancylostoma duodenale* and *Necator americanus*, respectively.  Sometimes used off-label for eosinophilic enterocolitis related to hookworm.
* **Trichostrongyliasis:** An infection caused by various species of *Trichostrongylus* nematodes. Less common than other helminth infections.
* **Moniliformis Infection:** An infection with the thorny-headed worm. Off-label usage.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Anthelmintic (Antihelminthic)

**Mechanism of Action:** Pyrantel Pamoate acts as a depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, specifically targeting nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction of susceptible helminths. This induces spastic paralysis in the worms, preventing them from maintaining their attachment to the intestinal wall.  The paralyzed worms are then expelled from the gastrointestinal tract through normal peristalsis.  It is poorly absorbed systemically, leading to high concentrations within the intestinal lumen where the parasites reside.

## **Alternate Names**

* Pyrantel embonate
* Pin-X, Pin Rid, Pronto Plus Pinworm, Reese's Pinworm Medicine, Ascarel, Pin-Away (brand names)



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Pyrantel Pamoate acts as a depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent on susceptible nematodes. It mimics the action of acetylcholine, leading to persistent depolarization of the muscle cell membrane at the neuromuscular junction of the worms. This prolonged depolarization results in spastic paralysis, preventing the worms from maintaining their position in the intestine and ultimately leading to their expulsion.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. This characteristic is advantageous for treating intestinal parasites as it allows for high drug concentrations at the site of infection while minimizing systemic exposure.
* **Metabolism:** Limited data on the specific metabolic pathways of Pyrantel Pamoate exists. The drug is not extensively metabolized.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated unchanged in the feces, with a small amount excreted in the urine.  Approximately 50% is recovered in the feces and 7% in the urine.


**Mode of Action:**  Pyrantel Pamoate's action is specific to nematode nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It is an agonist at these receptors, meaning it binds to and activates them, leading to an influx of sodium ions and depolarization. Unlike the normal transient action of acetylcholine, Pyrantel Pamoate causes persistent depolarization, leading to sustained muscle contraction and eventual paralysis.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the muscle cells of nematodes, acting as a depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily eliminated unchanged through the feces, with a small portion excreted in the urine.  There is very minimal hepatic metabolism involved.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 11 mg/kg (of pyrantel base) orally as a single dose, not to exceed 1 gram.  For pinworm infections, a repeat dose is often recommended after 2 weeks.

#### **Children (2 years and older):**  The same dosage as adults (11 mg/kg of pyrantel base orally as a single dose, not to exceed 1 gram), with a repeat dose after 2 weeks for pinworm infections.  Safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 2 years old.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use standard dosage, but monitor for potential adverse events.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically recommended, as Pyrantel Pamoate is not primarily renally cleared.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution due to the potential for altered drug clearance. Specific guidelines are not available.  It is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor closely, particularly in patients with anemia, malnutrition, or intestinal obstruction.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Pyrantel Pamoate is not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its use is primarily limited to the treatment of the specific helminth infections previously mentioned.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are not typically necessary based on renal function, but caution is advised in cases of hepatic impairment.




## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal cramps or pain
* Loss of appetite
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Drowsiness
* Insomnia

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Elevated liver enzymes (transient)

### **Long-Term Effects:**  No significant long-term side effects are typically associated with Pyrantel Pamoate due to its limited systemic absorption and infrequent dosing.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Serious allergic reactions require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to Pyrantel Pamoate or any component of the formulation.
* Patients with intestinal obstruction.
* Patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.
* Children younger than two years old unless directed by a physician.
* Severe malnutrition or anemia



## **Drug Interactions**

* **Piperazine:** Concurrent use may decrease the effectiveness of both drugs.
* **Theophylline:**  Pyrantel Pamoate may increase theophylline levels.
* **Sodium Iodide I-123 and I-131:** May interfere with imaging results.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (Data on the use of Pyrantel Pamoate in pregnant women is limited. It should only be used if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.)
* **Breastfeeding:**  Limited information is available on the excretion of Pyrantel Pamoate in breast milk.  It is generally considered safe to use during breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent targeting nematodes.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, insomnia. Rarely, allergic reactions or transient liver enzyme elevation.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, intestinal obstruction, severe hepatic impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Piperazine, theophylline, sodium iodide.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution during pregnancy only if benefit outweighs risk; generally safe during breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** 11 mg/kg (base) orally once; repeat in 2 weeks for pinworm infections. Maximum dose 1g.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Observe for resolution of helminth infection symptoms.  Monitor for allergic reactions and gastrointestinal side effects. If signs of liver dysfunction occur, check liver function tests.


## **Popular Combinations**

Pyrantel Pamoate is typically used as monotherapy. Combination therapy with other anthelmintics is generally not recommended.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Screen for potential contraindications, such as hypersensitivity or severe hepatic impairment.
* **Specific Populations:**  Use with caution in pregnant and breastfeeding women. Not recommended for children under two years of age without medical supervision.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** No specific lifestyle restrictions are typically associated with Pyrantel Pamoate use.
