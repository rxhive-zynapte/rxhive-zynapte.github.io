## **Usage**

- Pyritinol is prescribed as an adjunct therapy for various cerebrovascular disorders affecting blood flow and blood vessels in the brain, and mental function disorders characterized by disturbances in cognition, emotional regulation, or behavior.  It is also used in the treatment of vegetative dysfunction in children and adolescents.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Nootropic.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Pyritinol influences neurotransmitter signaling pathways, including N-methyl-d-aspartate, Î³-aminobutyric acid, and acetylcholine. It demonstrates anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and reduces plasma viscosity.

## **Alternate Names**

- Pyridoxine disulfide
- Pyrithioxine
- **Brand Names:** Encephabol, Encefabol, Cerbon 6

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Pyritinol improves cerebral function by enhancing glucose uptake and utilization, promoting nucleic acid metabolism, increasing cortical acetylcholine release and cholinergic transmission, stabilizing cell membrane structure and function via lysosomal enzyme inhibition, and preventing free radical formation. It also exhibits hemorheological effects by improving blood fluidity. In EEG studies, it increases cortical activity, possibly by activating different brain regions.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Pyritinol crosses the blood-brain barrier and accumulates in the gray matter, particularly the hippocampus, cerebral nuclei, cerebellum, and cortex.  It does not accumulate even with repeated oral administration and does not reach toxic concentrations, even in patients with renal impairment. Minimal amounts are excreted in human milk.
- **Mode of Action:**  Pyritinol improves cerebral metabolism and central cholinergic transmission, normalizes cerebral microcirculation, and protects nerve cells against hypoxia, poor perfusion, and metabolic disturbances.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 600 mg daily, divided into three doses.

#### **Children:**

- 6-15 years: 100 mg three times daily (tablet) or 5 ml three times daily (liquid).
- <6 years: 2.5-10 ml daily (liquid).
- Infants (up to 1 year): 1.25 ml twice daily.
- 1-6 years: 2.5 ml twice daily.
- Pediatric Safety Considerations: The last dose should be administered no later than the late afternoon to avoid sleep disturbances.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient response and tolerance.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution should be exercised.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune diseases. Regular clinical checkups and lab tests are recommended.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The standard dosage is generally applied across clinical settings. No specific dosage adjustments are mentioned in the sources for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be necessary for patients with chronic conditions, with therapy lasting at least 6-8 weeks.

## **Side Effects**
