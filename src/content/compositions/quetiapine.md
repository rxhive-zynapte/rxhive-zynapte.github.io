## **Usage**

Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic prescribed for:

*   **Schizophrenia:** Treatment of acute psychotic episodes and maintenance therapy.
*   **Bipolar Disorder:** Treatment of manic episodes (alone or with lithium or divalproex), depressive episodes, and maintenance therapy (with lithium or divalproex).
*   **Major Depressive Disorder (MDD):** Adjunctive therapy to antidepressants (extended-release formulation only).

**Pharmacological Classification:** Atypical antipsychotic.

**Mechanism of Action:**  Antagonist at multiple neurotransmitter receptors, including serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, dopamine D<sub>2</sub>, histamine H<sub>1</sub>, and adrenergic α<sub>1</sub> receptors. This combined action is thought to contribute to its therapeutic effects in various psychiatric conditions.


## **Alternate Names**

*   **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Quetiapine.

*   **Brand Names:** Seroquel (immediate-release and extended-release), Quitide (various formulations).



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Quetiapine primarily acts by blocking serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors. At lower doses, it shows higher affinity for serotonin receptors, which might explain its efficacy in treating depressive symptoms and anxiety. At higher doses, dopamine receptor antagonism becomes more prominent, contributing to its antipsychotic effects. It also has affinity for histamine H<sub>1</sub> and adrenergic α<sub>1</sub> receptors, which can lead to sedative and hypotensive effects, respectively.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in 1–2 hours (immediate-release) and approximately 6 hours (extended-release).
*   **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 enzyme. The major active metabolite is norquetiapine.
*   **Elimination:** Excreted mainly in urine (73%) and feces (21%).  The elimination half-life is about 7 hours for quetiapine and 12 hours for norquetiapine.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Quetiapine acts as an antagonist at serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>, dopamine D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, histamine H<sub>1</sub>, and adrenergic α<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>2</sub> receptors. It does not significantly inhibit CYP enzymes, except for a slight inhibitory effect on CYP2D6.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4, followed by renal and fecal excretion.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   **Schizophrenia (IR):** Initial 25 mg twice daily, increased by 25–50 mg two or three times daily up to 300–400 mg/day by day 4. Maintenance dose: 150-750 mg/day.
* **Schizophrenia (XR):** Initial 300 mg once daily, titrated up to 400–800 mg/day.
*   **Bipolar Mania (IR):** Initial 100 mg twice daily, increasing by up to 100 mg twice daily to 400 mg/day by day 4, then by increments up to 200 mg/day, with a maximum of 800 mg/day by day 6.
*   **Bipolar Mania (XR):** Initial 300 mg once daily, increasing to 600 mg/day on day 2. Maintenance dose: 400–800 mg/day.
*   **Bipolar Depression:** 50 mg at bedtime on day 1, increased by 50–100 mg daily to 300 mg/day at bedtime.
*   **MDD (XR adjunct):** 50 mg/day in the evening on days 1 and 2, increased to 150 mg/day on day 3. Usual dose: 150–300 mg/day.

#### **Children:** Not generally recommended for use in children under 18 except in clinical trials. Limited evidence suggests following adult guidelines using lower doses under strict supervision. Pediatric safety concerns include extrapyramidal symptoms, weight gain, and metabolic effects.


#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly:** Lower starting doses and slower titration are recommended.
*   **Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is typically necessary.
*   **Hepatic Impairment:** Start with 25 mg/day and titrate cautiously.
*   **Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is needed, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease or diabetes.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Quetiapine's primary use is in managing psychosis and mood disorders. Evidence for its effectiveness in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgery, mechanical ventilation, and the ICU is limited.  It might be used for agitation or delirium in these settings, but with caution.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on clinical response, tolerability, and patient-specific factors like age, hepatic impairment, and concomitant medications. Therapeutic drug monitoring may be useful.


## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects**

*   Somnolence, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, weight gain, increased appetite, orthostatic hypotension, dyslipidemia, elevated liver enzymes.

## **Drug Interactions**

*   **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** Increase quetiapine plasma levels, requiring dose reduction.
*   **CYP3A4 Inducers:** Decrease quetiapine plasma levels, potentially reducing efficacy.
*   **CNS Depressants:** Additive sedative effects.
