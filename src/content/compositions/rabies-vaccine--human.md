## **Usage**

Rabies vaccine, Human is prescribed for the prevention of rabies infection.  It is used for both pre-exposure prophylaxis in individuals at high risk of exposure (e.g., veterinarians, animal handlers, laboratory workers, travelers to rabies-endemic areas) and post-exposure prophylaxis following a potential rabies exposure (e.g., bite, scratch, or lick from a potentially rabid animal).

**Pharmacological classification:** Vaccine (active immunizing agent)

**Mechanism of action:** Stimulates active immunity by inducing the production of rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies.

## **Alternate Names**

Rabies vaccine may also be referred to as Human Diploid Cell Vaccine (HDCV) or Purified Chick Embryo Cell Vaccine (PCEC), depending on the specific formulation. Several brands are available.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** The vaccine mimics a rabies infection, prompting the immune system to produce antibodies against the rabies virus. These antibodies neutralize the virus, preventing it from spreading and causing disease.

**Pharmacokinetics:** The vaccine is administered intramuscularly (IM) or intradermally (ID). IM injection into the deltoid muscle (adults and older children) or anterolateral thigh (infants and young children) is preferred. The gluteal muscle should be avoided due to potential for reduced immunogenicity.  Following injection, the vaccine components are processed by the immune system, leading to antibody production. Antibody titers peak within 2-4 weeks after completion of the primary series. Elimination pathways and metabolism of the vaccine components are not typically studied in the same way as traditional drugs.

**Mode of action:** The vaccine introduces inactivated rabies virus into the body.  This inactivated virus is recognized by antigen-presenting cells, which then activate B lymphocytes. The B lymphocytes differentiate into plasma cells that produce rabies-specific antibodies.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  Pre-exposure prophylaxis: Two 1.0 mL doses IM, administered into the deltoid muscle, seven days apart. Post-exposure prophylaxis (for unvaccinated individuals): Four 1.0 mL doses IM, administered on days 0, 3, 7, and 14, along with Rabies Immune Globulin (RIG) on day 0.

#### **Children:**  Pre-exposure prophylaxis: Same as adult dosing. Post-exposure prophylaxis: Same as adult dosing, but the IM injection may be administered into the anterolateral thigh muscle.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  May have a diminished immune response. Antibody titers should be checked, and booster doses might be necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustment is typically required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific dose adjustment is typically required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Immunosuppressed individuals may have a reduced response to the vaccine. Additional doses or RIG may be considered.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosages outlined above apply to general clinical use cases for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis.  Specific clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, and ICU use do not generally necessitate rabies vaccination unless a potential rabies exposure occurs in these settings.  In emergency situations involving animal bites, standard post-exposure prophylaxis should be followed.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be needed based on factors like immune status. For example, immunocompromised individuals may require additional vaccine doses or RIG.  Pregnant and breastfeeding women should receive post-exposure prophylaxis if exposed to rabies.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, headache, nausea, muscle aches, dizziness, fever, malaise.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (e.g., hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or throat), Guillain-Barr√© syndrome.


### **Long-Term Effects**

No long-term side effects specifically associated with rabies vaccines are commonly reported.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, neurological complications (rare).



## **Contraindications**

Severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of rabies vaccine or any of its components.


## **Drug Interactions**

Immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., corticosteroids) can reduce the immune response to the vaccine.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy is not a contraindication to post-exposure prophylaxis, as rabies is a fatal disease. While pre-exposure prophylaxis is generally delayed until after pregnancy, it can be administered if there is a substantial risk of exposure. The vaccine is considered safe for breastfeeding mothers.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Stimulates the production of rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies.
- **Side Effects:** Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling), headache, nausea, muscle aches, fever.
- **Contraindications:** Severe allergy to previous dose or vaccine component.
- **Drug Interactions:** Immunosuppressants.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Safe for post-exposure prophylaxis in both pregnancy and breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:**  See detailed section above.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Antibody titers (in certain situations, e.g., immunocompromised individuals).


## **Popular Combinations**

Rabies vaccine is often administered with Rabies Immune Globulin (RIG) as part of post-exposure prophylaxis in unvaccinated individuals.



## **Precautions**

Standard precautions for vaccine administration should be followed. Screen for allergies to vaccine components. Monitor for adverse reactions.  In immunocompromised patients, antibody titers should be assessed after vaccination.
