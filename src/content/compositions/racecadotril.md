## **Usage**

- Racecadotril is prescribed for the symptomatic treatment of acute diarrhea in adults and children over three months of age.  It is used as an adjunctive therapy to oral rehydration when rehydration alone is insufficient.  In cases where the cause of diarrhea can be treated directly, racecadotril can be used as a complementary treatment.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antidiarrheal, Enkephalinase inhibitor
- **Mechanism of Action:** Racecadotril is a prodrug that is rapidly hydrolyzed to its active metabolite, thiorphan. Thiorphan inhibits enkephalinase, a membrane-bound peptidase found in the brush border of the small intestine. Enkephalinase degrades enkephalins, naturally occurring opioid peptides. By inhibiting enkephalinase, racecadotril increases the concentration of enkephalins in the gut. Enkephalins decrease intestinal secretions, thereby reducing the loss of water and electrolytes in the stool.

## **Alternate Names**

- Acetorphan
- Tiorfan
- Hidrasec
- Tiorfix
- Tiorfast

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Racecadotril reduces intestinal hypersecretion by inhibiting enkephalinase, thus reducing the volume and frequency of stools in acute diarrhea.  It does not affect bowel transit time.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Racecadotril is well-absorbed orally and rapidly converted to its active metabolite, thiorphan.
    - **Metabolism:** Rapidly metabolized to the active metabolite thiorphan.
    - **Elimination:** Thiorphan is eliminated primarily through the kidneys.  The half-life is approximately 3 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Racecadotril, via its active metabolite thiorphan, inhibits the enzyme enkephalinase, which is responsible for degrading enkephalins in the small intestine.  The increased concentration of enkephalins reduces intestinal fluid secretion without affecting basal intestinal motility.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Inhibits enkephalinase, an enzyme that breaks down enkephalins.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: 100 mg regardless of the time of day.
- Maintenance dose: 100 mg three times daily, preferably before meals.
- Maximum daily dose: 400 mg
- Duration of treatment: Continue until two normal stools are recorded, not to exceed 7 days.

#### **Children:**

- Dosage is weight-based: 1.5 mg/kg per dose, three times daily.
- Infants (>3 months) <9 kg: 10 mg three times daily
- Infants 9- <13 kg: 20 mg three times daily
