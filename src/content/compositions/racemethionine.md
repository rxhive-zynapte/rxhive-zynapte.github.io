## **Usage**

Racemethionine is primarily used to acidify urine. This helps to relieve skin irritation in adults with incontinence and infants with diaper rash. It also helps control strong urine odor by lowering urinary pH, which reduces the volatilization of ammonia.  It can be used as an antidote for acetaminophen overdose, although N-acetylcysteine is generally preferred.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Urinary acidifier, antidote (in acetaminophen overdose)

- **Mechanism of Action:** Racemethionine is metabolized to sulfate and other acidic byproducts. These byproducts increase the acidity of the urine.  The exact mechanism by which it relieves skin irritation isn't fully understood but is associated with decreasing the pH.

## **Alternate Names**

- Methionine
- DL-Methionine
- ME-500

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Racemethionine's primary effect is to lower urinary pH, making the urine more acidic. This helps prevent the breakdown of urea to ammonia, minimizing skin irritation and odor associated with alkaline urine.  In acetaminophen overdose, it may help by replenishing hepatic glutathione stores, but this effect is secondary to N-acetylcysteine.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Racemethionine is absorbed orally. The specific pharmacokinetic parameters (absorption rate, bioavailability, metabolism, and elimination half-life) are not precisely defined in available literature. It is known that the drug is metabolized in the liver and primarily eliminated renally.

- **Mode of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** The primary mode of action in acidifying urine is through the production of acidic metabolites in the liver. It does not have specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation properties related to this primary use.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Racemethionine and its metabolites are primarily excreted through renal pathways.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- Capsules/Tablets: 200-500 mg three to four times a day.
- Oral Solution: 2⅔ teaspoonfuls (200 mg) three to four times a day.

#### **Children:**
- Oral Solution: 
    - > 14 months: 2⅔ teaspoonfuls (200 mg) three or four times a day.
    - 6-14 months: 1 teaspoonful (75 mg) four times a day for three to five days.
    - 2-6 months: 1 teaspoonful (75 mg) three times a day for three to five days.
    - < 2 months: Dosage must be determined by a physician.

- Capsules: 200 mg mixed with formula or milk/juice once daily, typically in the evening.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments, but monitor for adverse effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution advised; dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in severe liver disease. Use with caution in mild to moderate hepatic impairment; dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with metabolic acidosis.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations, are not specifically addressed in available resources.  Dosage recommendations are based on the indications mentioned above (primarily for acidifying urine).


### **Dosage Adjustments:**
Dose modifications are based on patient-specific factors like renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism, though precise recommendations are not detailed in available literature. Clinical judgment is required.
