## **Usage**

Raloxifene is prescribed for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. It has also been shown to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at high risk.  It is classified as a Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM).  Raloxifene acts by selectively binding to estrogen receptors in different tissues, acting as an estrogen agonist in bone and an estrogen antagonist in the uterus and breast.

## **Alternate Names**

Raloxifene hydrochloride is the generic name.  A popular brand name is Evista.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Raloxifene exerts estrogen-like effects on bone, increasing bone mineral density and reducing the risk of fractures.  In the uterus and breast, it acts as an estrogen antagonist, which helps to mitigate the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and breast cancer.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Raloxifene is well absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in approximately 6 hours. It undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver, primarily by glucuronidation.  It is eliminated mainly through biliary excretion in the feces, with a small amount excreted in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 28 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Raloxifene binds to estrogen receptors, modulating their transcriptional activity in a tissue-specific manner.  This selective estrogen receptor modulation results in the desired effects on bone, uterus, and breast tissue.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Raloxifene primarily acts through binding to estrogen receptors.  While it doesn't directly inhibit enzymes or modulate neurotransmitters, its effects on estrogen receptor signaling can indirectly influence various downstream pathways.

**Elimination Pathways:** Raloxifene is primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism, with subsequent biliary excretion in the feces. A smaller portion undergoes renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard dose is 60 mg orally once daily, taken with or without food.

#### **Children:**

Raloxifene is not indicated for use in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is necessary.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in moderate to severe renal impairment.  Safety and efficacy are not established in severe renal impairment. No data are available regarding dosing for mild renal impairment.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution; safety and efficacy have not been fully established. Contraindicated for patients with severe hepatic dysfunction or cholestasis.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with a history of venous thromboembolism, including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and retinal vein thrombosis.  It is also contraindicated in women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. Use cautiously in patients with hypertriglyceridemia or coronary heart disease due to increased risks.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Raloxifene is not indicated for use in situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are not typically made based on specific clinical use cases but rather on renal or hepatic impairment, as described above.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Hot flashes, leg cramps, swelling in the extremities (edema), flu-like symptoms, joint pain, sweating, insomnia, nausea, vomiting.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, retinal vein thrombosis), stroke, endometrial cancer (in specific high-risk individuals), gallbladder disease (cholelithiasis, cholecystitis), hypertriglyceridemia, severe allergic reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

The long-term effects of raloxifene are primarily related to its benefits in preventing osteoporosis and reducing breast cancer risk.  However, continued monitoring for rare but serious side effects is essential.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Clinically significant ADRs include venous thromboembolism, stroke, and serious allergic reactions. These require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

Absolute contraindications include pregnancy, history of venous thromboembolism, hepatic impairment (including cholestasis), severe renal impairment, and unexplained uterine bleeding.  Raloxifene is also contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components.

## **Drug Interactions**

Clinically significant drug interactions include cholestyramine, which reduces the absorption of raloxifene.  Estrogens may counteract the beneficial effects of raloxifene on bone. Warfarin requires close monitoring when co-administered due to potential alterations in coagulation parameters. Levothyroxine and raloxifene may interfere with each other's absorption; separate administration by at least 1 hour is recommended.  Other interactions may occur with highly protein-bound drugs, such as diazepam and diazoxide.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Raloxifene is contraindicated during pregnancy (Pregnancy Category X).  It may cause fetal harm.  It is not known if raloxifene is excreted in human milk.  Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking raloxifene.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM)

* **Side Effects:** Hot flashes, leg cramps, edema, flu-like symptoms, venous thromboembolism, stroke

* **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, venous thromboembolism history, hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment

* **Drug Interactions:** Cholestyramine, estrogens, warfarin, levothyroxine

* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy and not recommended during breastfeeding

* **Dosage:** 60 mg orally once daily

* **Monitoring Parameters:** Bone mineral density, lipid profile, signs and symptoms of venous thromboembolism

## **Popular Combinations**

Raloxifene is often used in conjunction with calcium and vitamin D supplementation to optimize bone health in postmenopausal women.

## **Precautions**

Patients should be screened for history of venous thromboembolism, hepatic and renal function, and pregnancy before starting raloxifene.  Caution should be exercised in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and coronary heart disease. Women of childbearing potential should use reliable contraception. Lifestyle modifications, such as smoking cessation and regular weight-bearing exercise, are encouraged.
