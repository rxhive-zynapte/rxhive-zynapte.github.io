## **Usage**

- Raltegravir is prescribed, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults, adolescents, children, and infants from 4 weeks of age and older.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antiretroviral, Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor (INSTI)
- **Mechanism of Action:** Raltegravir inhibits HIV integrase, an enzyme essential for viral replication. By preventing the integration of viral DNA into the host cell's DNA, raltegravir blocks the formation of new HIV-1 virions.

## **Alternate Names** 

- International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Raltegravir potassium (amorphous)
- **Brand Names:** Isentress, Isentress HD

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Raltegravir exerts its antiviral effect by targeting the integration step of the HIV-1 replication cycle. It specifically inhibits HIV-1 integrase, preventing the insertion of viral DNA into the host cell's genome. This action effectively halts viral replication and reduces the viral load in infected individuals.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Raltegravir is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) in approximately 3 hours. Food does not significantly affect absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Raltegravir is primarily metabolized via glucuronidation by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1.  It is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes.
    - **Elimination:** Raltegravir is eliminated primarily through hepatic metabolism and subsequent excretion in the feces (approximately 82%), with a smaller portion excreted in the urine (approximately 18%).
- **Mode of Action:** Raltegravir binds to the integrase enzyme at the viral DNA-integrase complex, preventing the strand transfer step of integration.  This prevents the insertion of viral DNA into host cellular DNA.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Raltegravir is a highly specific inhibitor of HIV-1 integrase. It does not inhibit human polymerases or other cellular enzymes.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism via UGT1A1 glucuronidation, followed by fecal and urinary excretion.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Isentress:** 400 mg orally twice daily.
- **Isentress HD:** 1200 mg (two 600 mg tablets) orally once daily for treatment-na√Øve patients or those virologically suppressed on an initial regimen of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily.  Do not use the 400 mg tablet to administer the once daily regimen.
- With rifampin: 800 mg twice daily.

#### **Children:**
-  **Neonates (birth to 4 weeks) weighing 2kg or more:** Raltegravir Oral Suspension according to weight-based dosing (see detailed source information provided, as dosing varies by weight and week of life).
- **4 weeks and older, weighing between 3 kg and less than 25 kg**: Weight-based dosing of oral suspension or chewable tablets, approximately 6 mg/kg twice daily (max 300mg twice daily for chewable tablets, and 100 mg twice daily for oral suspension). See detailed source information provided, as dosing varies by weight band. 
- **At least 25 kg:**  400 mg twice daily (one 400-mg film-coated tablet twice daily).  If unable to swallow tablets, use chewable tablets according to the weight based guidance (up to 300 mg twice daily).
- **At least 40 kg:** 400 mg twice daily (one 400-mg film-coated tablet twice daily) or 1200 mg once daily (two 600-mg film-coated tablets once daily). 



#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to potential age-related changes in hepatic, renal, or cardiac function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction (Mild to Moderate):** No dosage adjustment required for twice daily dosing. HD formulation is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment. Severe hepatic impairment has not been studied.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized assessment is required.  For example, patients with tuberculosis may require dose adjustment if receiving rifampin.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  Raltegravir is not indicated for use in these clinical scenarios as described in the prompt: intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations (e.g. status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.) It is used for HIV-1 infection treatment only, and should not be used in these circumstances.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- **Rifampin Co-administration:** 800 mg twice daily in adults.  No data are available for pediatric patients.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
- Headache, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, insomnia, vomiting, abdominal pain.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), hypersensitivity reactions, rhabdomyolysis, hepatotoxicity, depression, suicidal thoughts.

### **Long-Term Effects**
- Myopathy, increased creatine kinase, increased risk of certain infections with immune reconstitution. 

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
- As noted above, severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions, hepatotoxicity, rhabdomyolysis, and suicidal ideation require immediate intervention.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to raltegravir.


## **Drug Interactions**

- **Drugs that induce or inhibit UGT1A1:** May alter raltegravir plasma levels.
- **Antacids containing aluminum, magnesium, or calcium:** Should not be taken concurrently with raltegravir.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

-  Limited data is available for pregnancy. Raltegravir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Integrase strand transfer inhibitor.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, insomnia, rare but serious skin reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:** Rifampin, UGT1A1 inducers/inhibitors, antacids containing aluminum, magnesium, or calcium.

## **Popular Combinations**

Raltegravir is commonly used in combination with other antiretroviral agents, such as nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and other INSTIs, to create a complete antiretroviral regimen. Specific combinations are chosen based on individual patient factors, including resistance testing and other medications.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Monitor for signs of hypersensitivity, skin reactions, hepatotoxicity, and myopathy.
- **Specific Populations:** as described in other sections.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Adherence to prescribed dosing schedule is crucial for maintaining viral suppression and preventing drug resistance.
