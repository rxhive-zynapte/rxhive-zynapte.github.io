## **Usage**

Ramucirumab is prescribed for the treatment of several types of cancer, including:

* **Gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma:**  Used in advanced stages, either alone or with paclitaxel, after prior chemotherapy containing fluoropyrimidine or platinum.
* **Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC):** Used after platinum-based chemotherapy, in combination with docetaxel, or as first-line treatment with erlotinib for patients with specific EGFR mutations.
* **Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC):**  For patients with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) of 400 ng/mL or greater who have been previously treated with sorafenib.
* **Colorectal cancer:** Used in combination with FOLFIRI (folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan), for patients previously treated with bevacizumab, oxaliplatin-based, and fluoropyrimidine therapy.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Ramucirumab is a monoclonal antibody, specifically a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) antagonist.

**Mechanism of Action:**  Ramucirumab blocks the binding of VEGF to VEGFR2, thereby inhibiting angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels).  This deprives tumors of the blood supply necessary for growth and metastasis.


## **Alternate Names**

* **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** ramucirumab
* **Brand Name:** Cyramza®


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ramucirumab binds with high affinity to VEGFR2, blocking the binding of VEGF ligands. This inhibits ligand-induced activation of the receptor and downstream signaling pathways, ultimately preventing tumor angiogenesis.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Administered intravenously, therefore 100% bioavailable.
* **Metabolism:**  As a monoclonal antibody, metabolism is expected to be similar to endogenous IgG, primarily through degradation into small peptides and amino acids.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through protein catabolism, with a small amount possibly excreted in the urine and feces. The half-life is approximately 14 days.

**Mode of Action:** Ramucirumab specifically targets the extracellular domain of VEGFR2, preventing the binding of VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D.  This inhibits receptor dimerization and activation of tyrosine kinases, leading to a reduction in downstream signaling, which subsequently inhibits endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and the formation of new blood vessels that supply the tumor.

**Receptor Binding:** Binds to VEGFR2.

**Enzyme Inhibition:** Indirectly inhibits downstream kinases involved in the VEGF signaling pathway.

**Neurotransmitter Modulation:** No direct effect on neurotransmitter modulation.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily through protein catabolism.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Gastric Cancer/Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma:** 8 mg/kg IV infusion every 2 weeks, as a single agent or in combination with paclitaxel (80 mg/m² IV infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle).
* **NSCLC with docetaxel:** 10 mg/kg IV infusion every 3 weeks (21-day cycle).
* **NSCLC with erlotinib:** 10 mg/kg IV infusion every 2 weeks.
* **HCC:** 8 mg/kg IV infusion every 2 weeks.
* **Colorectal cancer:** 8 mg/kg IV infusion every 2 weeks, in combination with FOLFIRI.

#### **Children:** No established dosage. Use with caution.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustment, but closer monitoring is advised.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No dose adjustment for mild to moderate impairment. No data available for severe renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment for mild to moderate impairment. Use with caution in severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring for patients with hypertension, bleeding disorders, or history of thromboembolic events.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Ramucirumab is not specifically indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose reductions may be necessary for severe hypertension, proteinuria, or other adverse effects.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Fatigue, hypertension, proteinuria, diarrhea, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, stomatitis, epistaxis, headache.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Hemorrhage (including gastrointestinal and cerebral hemorrhage), arterial thromboembolic events (including myocardial infarction and stroke), gastrointestinal perforation, impaired wound healing, infusion-related reactions, hypertension, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).


### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic hypertension, proteinuria, risk of secondary malignancies with prolonged use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to ramucirumab. Active bleeding. Severe uncontrolled hypertension. Pregnancy.


## **Drug Interactions**

No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted. However, concomitant use with other antiangiogenic agents or drugs that affect wound healing should be done with caution. Bevacizumab increases the risk of severe bleeding and should not be co-administered.  No clinically significant interactions with CYP450 enzymes have been observed.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Contraindicated in pregnancy.  May cause fetal harm due to inhibition of angiogenesis.

**Breastfeeding:**  Not recommended. Potential for infant exposure through breast milk. Discontinue breastfeeding during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last dose.
