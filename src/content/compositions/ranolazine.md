## **Usage**

- Ranolazine is prescribed for the treatment of chronic angina (chest pain) as add-on therapy in patients who experience inadequate symptom relief or are intolerant to first-line antianginal medications like beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Antianginal agent.
- Ranolazine's mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is believed to work by reducing the late sodium current in heart muscle cells. This helps to stabilize the cell membrane and may improve myocardial oxygen supply-demand balance during periods of ischemia.

## **Alternate Names**

- International nonproprietary name (INN): Ranolazine.
- **Brand names:** Ranexa, Aspruzyo Sprinkle.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ranolazine reduces the late sodium current in cardiac myocytes, thereby decreasing intracellular calcium overload and improving diastolic relaxation. This leads to improved myocardial oxygen utilization and reduced angina symptoms.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Absorption:  Ranolazine is absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentration in 2-5 hours. Food does not affect absorption.
    - Metabolism: Primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2D6 enzymes in the liver.
    - Elimination: Excreted in urine and feces, with a half-life of approximately 7 hours. Steady-state concentration is achieved within 3 days.
- **Mode of Action:** Ranolazine inhibits the late sodium current by blocking the influx of sodium ions into cardiac cells during the plateau phase of the action potential. This reduces intracellular calcium overload and improves diastolic relaxation.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Primarily acts by inhibiting late sodium current. It does not significantly affect heart rate, blood pressure, or contractility.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism followed by renal and fecal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: 500 mg twice daily.
- Titration: Increase to 1000 mg twice daily, as needed, based on clinical symptoms. Maximum dose: 1000 mg twice daily.
- Administration: Administer orally with or without food. Tablets should be swallowed whole and not crushed, broken, or chewed.


#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy not established in patients under 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are recommended, but caution is advised due to potential age-related changes in drug metabolism.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment provided by manufacturer. However, Cmax increases in patients with renal impairment. Close monitoring is advised and discontinuation should be considered if acute renal failure develops.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment and cirrhosis. Dosage reduction may be considered for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment without cirrhosis, starting at 500 mg once daily.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dose adjustment may be needed for patients with diabetes taking metformin concomitantly. For patients on ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily, the metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg daily, and blood glucose should be closely monitored.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  
Ranolazine is specifically indicated for **chronic angina** and is **not** recommended for the following clinical settings:

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations** (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest)  


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- **Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** Limit the maximum dose to 500 mg twice daily when co-administered with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin, fluconazole).
- **P-gp Inhibitors:** Titrate dose based on clinical response when used with P-gp inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine).

## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** Moderate inhibitors (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin) require dose reduction. Strong inhibitors are contraindicated.
- **CYP3A4 Inducers:** May decrease ranolazine efficacy.
- **P-gp Inhibitors:** (e.g., cyclosporine) May increase ranolazine concentrations.
- **QT Prolonging Drugs:** Concurrent use increases the risk of Torsades de pointes.
- **Metformin:** Ranolazine may increase metformin plasma concentrations, requiring metformin dose adjustment and blood glucose monitoring.
- **Grapefruit juice:** May increase ranolazine levels and should be avoided.
