## **Usage**

- Rasagiline is prescribed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), either as monotherapy or as adjunct therapy to levodopa.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitor.
- **Mechanism of action:** Rasagiline selectively and irreversibly inhibits MAO-B, an enzyme responsible for breaking down dopamine in the brain. This action increases dopamine levels, thereby improving motor control and reducing PD symptoms.

## **Alternate Names**

- Rasagiline mesylate (salt form)
- **Brand names:** Azilect®, APO-Rasagiline®, TEVA-Rasagiline®, Rasagiline ratiopharm®, JAMP Rasagiline®

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Rasagiline primarily exerts its therapeutic effect by increasing dopaminergic activity in the brain.  It may also have neuroprotective effects.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Rasagiline is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within approximately 0.5 to 1.5 hours.
    - **Metabolism:**  Rasagiline is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP1A2.  The major metabolites are 1-aminoindan and 3-hydroxy-N-propargyl-1-aminoindan.
    - **Elimination:** Metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. The elimination half-life of rasagiline is approximately 0.6 to 2 hours.
- **Mode of action:** Rasagiline irreversibly binds to and inhibits MAO-B, preventing the breakdown of dopamine. This leads to increased dopamine levels in the synaptic cleft, enhancing dopaminergic neurotransmission.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**  Rasagiline is a highly selective and irreversible inhibitor of MAO-B.  At higher doses, it loses selectivity and can also inhibit MAO-A.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism followed by renal excretion of metabolites.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Monotherapy:** 1 mg orally once daily.
- **Adjunct therapy (with levodopa):** Initial dose: 0.5 mg orally once daily.  May be increased to 1 mg once daily if needed and tolerated. Consider reducing levodopa dose upon rasagiline initiation.
- **Adjunct therapy (without levodopa):** 1 mg orally once daily.

#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy not established in patients younger than 18 years.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments recommended. However, close monitoring for adverse effects is advisable.
