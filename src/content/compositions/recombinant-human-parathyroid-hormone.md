# Recombinant Human parathyroid hormone (rhPTH(1-84))

## **Usage**

- Recombinant human parathyroid hormone (rhPTH(1-84)) is prescribed as an adjunct to calcium and vitamin D to control hypocalcemia in patients with hypoparathyroidism who are inadequately controlled with conventional therapy alone.  It is particularly beneficial for patients who experience frequent episodes of hypo- or hypercalcemia despite standard treatments.  It is important to note that due to the potential risk of osteosarcoma, rhPTH(1-84) is recommended only when conventional therapy is insufficient.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Hormone, specifically a parathyroid hormone analog.
- **Mechanism of Action:** rhPTH(1-84) mimics the action of endogenous parathyroid hormone (PTH).  It increases serum calcium levels by:
    * Increasing calcium reabsorption in the kidneys.
    * Increasing calcium absorption from the intestines (indirectly by stimulating the production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D).
    * Stimulating bone formation through direct effects on bone-forming cells (osteoblasts), while also increasing bone resorption.  The net effect on bone with intermittent dosing is bone formation.


## **Alternate Names**

- rhPTH(1-84)
- Recombinant human parathyroid hormone 1-84
- **Brand Name:** Natpara, Preotact


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** rhPTH(1-84) binds to PTH/PTHrP receptors, primarily in bone and kidney, initiating signaling cascades that lead to increased serum calcium and decreased serum phosphate.  Intermittent administration of rhPTH(1-84) stimulates bone formation and increases bone mineral density, while continuous exposure can lead to excessive bone resorption.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    * **Absorption:**  Rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous injection, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 5-30 minutes, followed by a second, smaller peak at 1-2 hours. Note: does not perfectly mimic the body's natural PTH release pattern.
    * **Metabolism:** Primarily hepatic, with a smaller role played by the kidneys. Cleaved by cathepsins in the liver.
    * **Elimination:** Primarily renal and hepatic. C-terminal fragments cleared by glomerular filtration.
    * **Half-life:** Approximately 3 hours.

- **Mode of Action:** Binds to and activates PTH/PTHrP receptors, G protein-coupled receptors that primarily signal through the cAMP/PKA and PLC/PKC pathways.
- **Receptor Binding:** PTH1 receptor (PTH/PTHrP receptor).
- **Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Initial:** 50 mcg subcutaneously once daily, administered in the thigh (alternate thighs daily).
- **Titration:** May increase by 25 mcg increments every 4 weeks, not to exceed 100 mcg/day, if serum calcium cannot be maintained above 8 mg/dL without active vitamin D and/or calcium supplementation. Conversely, the dose can be lowered to 25 mcg/day if calcium levels are consistently above 9 mg/dL after vitamin D has been discontinued and calcium supplements minimized.
- **Maintenance:** The lowest dose that maintains serum calcium (albumin-corrected) within the lower half of the normal range (8-9 mg/dL) without active vitamin D and with minimal calcium supplementation.


#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy not established in patients under 18 years old. No data are available.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower initial dose (25 mcg daily) and titrate cautiously.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment for mild to moderate impairment.  Data not available for severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or dialysis patients.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment for mild to moderate impairment. Data not available for severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring of serum calcium is advised in patients with concomitant conditions such as hypercalciuria and urolithiasis. Monitor for signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity if taking cardiac glycosides.



### **Clinical Use Cases**  

rhPTH(1-84) is specifically indicated for chronic hypoparathyroidism.  It is not approved for use in acute settings such as those listed below:

- Intubation
- Surgical Procedures
- Mechanical Ventilation
- Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use
- Emergency Situations 


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments should be based on serum calcium (albumin-corrected) and 24-hour urinary calcium excretion.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
- Hypocalcemia
- Muscle spasms
- Paresthesia
- Nausea
- Headache
- Sinusitis
- Injection site reactions

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
- Osteosarcoma (Black Box Warning)
- Hypercalcemia
- Renal impairment (in patients with pre-existing kidney disease)

### **Long-Term Effects:**
- Potential for osteosarcoma with prolonged use.
-  Possible changes in bone density distribution (increase in lumbar spine, variable effects on other sites).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
- Severe hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia requiring hospitalization.


## **Contraindications**

- **Absolute:** 
    - Hypersensitivity to rhPTH(1-84) or any of its components.

    - Paget’s disease of bone.
    - Unexplained elevations of alkaline phosphatase.
    - Open epiphyses (in children).
    - Hereditary disorders predisposing to osteosarcoma.
    - History of skeletal radiation therapy.


- **Relative:** Urolithiasis, hypercalciuria.


## **Drug Interactions**

- **Alendronate (and other bisphosphonates):** Concomitant use is not recommended, as it reduces the calcium-sparing effect of rhPTH(1-84).
- **Digoxin (Cardiac Glycosides):** Increases the risk of digoxin toxicity if hypercalcemia develops. Careful monitoring required.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  C.  Use only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
- **Breastfeeding:** It is unknown if rhPTH(1-84) is excreted in human milk.  Exercise caution if administering to a nursing woman.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Mimics endogenous PTH to increase serum calcium levels by acting on bone and kidney.
- **Side Effects:**  Hypocalcemia, muscle spasms, paresthesia, nausea, osteosarcoma (rare but serious).
- **Contraindications:** Osteosarcoma, Paget’s disease of bone, open epiphyses, previous skeletal radiation therapy.
- **Drug Interactions:** Alendronate, digoxin.
