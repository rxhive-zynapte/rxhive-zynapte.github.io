      What should patients avoid while taking Regorafenib?**


      **A:**  Patients should avoid grapefruit and its juice as they can
      increase the concentration of regorafenib in the blood, leading to an

      wort should also be avoided as they can decrease the effectiveness of
      Regorafenib.  Patients should talk to their doctor about all other
      medications and supplements they take.

      **A:**  Close monitoring is necessary for patients with mild to moderate
      hepatic impairment, and dose adjustments may be required. It should be
      avoided in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C). For
      renal impairment, no dose adjustment is generally needed for mild to
      moderate renal dysfunction. Data is limited for severe renal impairment.

      **A:** If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as remembered on
      the same day. Do not double the dose. If it's almost time for the next
      dose, skip the missed dose and resume the normal schedule.  Do not take
      two doses on the same day.

## **Usage**

Regorafenib is prescribed for the treatment of:

*   **Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC):**  In patients who have been previously treated with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, an anti-VEGF therapy, and, if RAS wild-type, an anti-EGFR therapy.
*   **Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST):** In patients who have been previously treated with imatinib and sunitinib.
*   **Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC):** In patients who have been previously treated with sorafenib.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Regorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor.

**Mechanism of Action:** Regorafenib inhibits multiple protein kinases involved in tumor angiogenesis (VEGFR1, -2, -3, TIE2), oncogenesis (KIT, RET, RAF-1, BRAF, BRAFV600E), metastasis (VEGFR3, PDGFR, FGFR), and tumor immunity (CSF1R). This broad kinase inhibition disrupts several pathways crucial for tumor growth, proliferation, and spread.


## **Alternate Names**

Stivarga is the most common brand name for regorafenib.  There are no widely used alternate generic names or regional variations.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Regorafenib exerts its anti-tumor effects by blocking key signaling pathways responsible for tumor growth and progression.  It disrupts angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels), inhibits cellular proliferation, and modulates tumor immunity.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Regorafenib is administered orally and is absorbed with peak plasma concentrations reached approximately 3-4 hours after administration with a low-fat meal. Taking it with a high-fat meal reduces its absorption.
*   **Metabolism:**  It is primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4 and UGT1A9 enzymes, producing active metabolites (M-2 and M-5).
*   **Elimination:** Excreted primarily in feces (71%), with a smaller portion eliminated in urine (19%). The terminal half-life is 20-30 hours for regorafenib and M-2, and 40-100 hours for M-5.


**Mode of Action:** Regorafenib binds to and inhibits the activity of multiple tyrosine kinases. These kinases play essential roles in cellular signaling pathways that regulate tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. The primary mechanism of action is thought to be related to the inhibition of angiogenesis and oncogenesis, ultimately leading to tumor growth inhibition.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Primarily enzyme inhibition (kinase inhibition) specifically targeting tyrosine kinases.


**Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly hepatic metabolism and fecal excretion.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard dose is 160 mg (four 40 mg tablets) taken orally once daily for 21 days, followed by a 7-day break. This 28-day cycle is repeated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The tablets should be taken with water after a low-fat meal (less than 30% fat).

#### **Children:**

Regorafenib is not recommended for use in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustments are generally required. Close monitoring is recommended due to potential age-related decline in organ function.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is generally needed for mild to moderate renal impairment.  Data is limited in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Close monitoring and dose adjustments may be necessary.  Avoid use in severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Close monitoring is recommended for patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, bleeding disorders, or those taking medications that affect blood clotting.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Regorafenib is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or emergency situations such as status epilepticus or cardiac arrest. Its use is limited to the treatment of specific cancer types as mentioned in the "Usage" section.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose reductions may be necessary based on individual tolerability and adverse effects. Dosage modifications are made in 40 mg steps.  The lowest recommended daily dose is 80 mg, and the maximum daily dose is 160 mg. Specific dose adjustments should be made in consultation with an oncologist and based on the severity and type of adverse events experienced.
