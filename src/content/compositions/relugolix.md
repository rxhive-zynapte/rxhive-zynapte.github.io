## **Usage**

- Relugolix is prescribed for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer in adult men.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Relugolix works by binding to and blocking the GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland. This inhibits the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to a reduction in testosterone production in the testes. Lowering testosterone levels helps slow or stop the growth of prostate cancer cells.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional variations:** The generic name is generally consistent internationally.
- **Brand Name:** Orgovyx.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Relugolix suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, leading to a significant decrease in serum testosterone levels. It achieves profound medical castration in most men.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Relugolix is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1-2 hours. Food does not significantly affect absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by the liver, mainly via CYP3A4. 
    - **Elimination:** Excreted in both urine and feces. The terminal half-life is approximately 27 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Relugolix competitively binds to the GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland. This prevents the endogenous GnRH from stimulating LH and FSH release, resulting in decreased testosterone synthesis. It does not cause a testosterone surge, unlike GnRH agonists.
- **Receptor Binding:** GnRH receptor antagonist.
- **Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Does not directly inhibit enzymes or modulate neurotransmitters in its primary mechanism of action, but its influence on testosterone levels indirectly affects multiple downstream pathways.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Hepatic metabolism (primarily CYP3A4), followed by excretion in urine and feces.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: 360 mg orally on day 1, followed by a maintenance dose of 120 mg orally once daily.
- Administration: Oral, with or without food, at approximately the same time each day.

#### **Children:**

- Not indicated for use in pediatric patients. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is generally required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised in patients with severe renal impairment. 
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with long QT syndrome, cardiovascular disease, electrolyte abnormalities, or those taking medications that prolong the QTc interval.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Relugolix is specifically indicated for advanced prostate cancer and does not have clinical applications in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- **Concomitant P-gp Inhibitors:** Avoid concomitant use. If unavoidable, adjust the timing of relugolix administration.
- **Concomitant P-gp and Strong CYP3A Inducers:** Avoid concomitant use. If unavoidable, adjust relugolix dose.



## **Side Effects**

- **CYP3A4 inducers:** May decrease relugolix levels.
- Medications that prolong the QTc interval: Increased risk of QT prolongation when used concurrently.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** X (contraindicated)
- Relugolix can cause fetal harm and pregnancy loss.  Men with female partners of reproductive potential must use effective contraception during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose.

- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy. Not recommended during breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** 360 mg loading dose followed by 120 mg daily.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Testosterone levels, ECG (for QT prolongation), liver function tests, blood glucose, lipid panel.


## **Popular Combinations**

Relugolix is typically used as monotherapy for advanced prostate cancer. Combination therapy may be considered in certain cases under specialist supervision.



## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Evaluate patients for cardiovascular risk factors, electrolyte abnormalities, and long QT syndrome before initiating therapy.  Monitor liver function, blood glucose, and lipid profile.
