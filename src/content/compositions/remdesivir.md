## **Usage**

- Remdesivir is indicated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adult and pediatric patients (birth to less than 18 years of age weighing at least 1.5 kg) who are:
    - Hospitalized, or
    - Not hospitalized and have mild-to-moderate COVID-19, and are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antiviral Agent; Nucleoside analogue RNA polymerase inhibitor.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Remdesivir acts as a prodrug of the active nucleoside triphosphate metabolite (GS-441524). GS-441524 inhibits viral RNA polymerase, thereby disrupting viral replication.

## **Alternate Names**

- GS-5734
- Veklury (brand name)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Remdesivir's active metabolite (GS-441524) incorporates into nascent viral RNA chains, causing premature termination.  This inhibits viral RNA polymerase, which ultimately disrupts viral replication.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Absorption: Following intravenous administration, remdesivir is rapidly converted to its active metabolite.
    - Metabolism: Remdesivir is metabolized to the pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate, GS-441524, intracellularly.
    - Elimination: Remdesivir and its metabolites are primarily eliminated by the kidneys (approximately 74%), with a smaller portion eliminated through the feces.
- **Mode of Action:**  Remdesivir acts as a delayed chain terminator of viral RNA synthesis.  The active metabolite competes with adenosine triphosphate for incorporation into RNA chains by viral RNA polymerase.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Inhibits viral RNA polymerase.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly renal excretion (approximately 74%), with some fecal elimination.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (and Pediatric Patients ≥40 kg):**

- Loading dose: 200 mg IV on Day 1.
- Maintenance dose: 100 mg IV daily from Day 2.
- Treatment Duration:
  - Hospitalized patients not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO: 5 days; may be extended to 10 days if no clinical improvement is observed.
  - Hospitalized patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO: 10 days.
  - Non-hospitalized patients: 3 days

#### **Children (<40 kg):**

- Refer to Table 1 for detailed pediatric dosing recommendations based on weight. Use the lyophilized powder formulation for pediatric patients 1.5kg to <40kg. Use the concentrated solution for children ≥40kg.
- **Neonates (<28 days old, ≥1.5 kg):** Loading dose: 2.5 mg/kg IV on Day 1; Maintenance dose: 1.25 mg/kg IV daily from Day 2.
- **Infants/Children (≥28 days old, <40 kg):**
    - 1.5kg to <3kg: Loading dose: 2.5 mg/kg IV on Day 1; Maintenance dose: 1.25 mg/kg IV daily.
    - 3 kg to <40 kg: Loading dose: 5 mg/kg IV on Day 1; Maintenance dose: 2.5 mg/kg IV daily.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment necessary. (Although not extensively studied, available data suggest no adjustment necessary).
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider comorbidities when assessing the risk-benefit of Remdesivir therapy. Monitor closely for adverse events.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosage guidelines remain the same for clinical scenarios including intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Generally, no dose adjustments are required based on renal or hepatic impairment.  However, close monitoring for adverse events is advised.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Nausea
- Elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST)
- Increased Prothrombin Time

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Limited data are available on long-term effects.  Monitor patients for potential renal or hepatic complications following treatment.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Anaphylaxis
- Acute kidney injury
- Hepatotoxicity

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to remdesivir or any of its components.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Potential interactions with drugs metabolized by CYP450 enzymes (CYP2C8, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) exist, though clinical significance is uncertain.
- Concomitant use with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is not recommended due to in vitro antagonism.
- Strong CYP inducers (e.g., rifampicin, lopinavir/ritonavir) may reduce remdesivir plasma concentrations and are not recommended.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Limited data available. Weigh the potential benefits against potential risks.
- **Fetal Risks/Teratogenicity:**  Animal data show potential adverse developmental effects. Insufficient human data to assess the risk.
- **Drug Excretion in Breast Milk:**  Unknown. Avoid breastfeeding during treatment and for a reasonable period after the last dose.

- **Side Effects:** Nausea, elevated liver enzymes, increased prothrombin time, hypotension (rarely).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to remdesivir.
- **Drug Interactions:** Potential interactions with CYP450 substrates and inhibitors; avoid concomitant use with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and strong CYP inducers.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Limited data; weigh risks and benefits.
- **Dosage:** See detailed dosage guidelines above.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests (ALT, AST), prothrombin time, renal function, serum creatinine (in neonates), vital signs.

## **Popular Combinations**

- The use of remdesivir with dexamethasone may be considered for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen.
