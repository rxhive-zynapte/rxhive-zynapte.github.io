## **Usage**

- Repaglinide is prescribed for **type 2 diabetes mellitus** in adults. It is used as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control.  It is not indicated for type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Antidiabetic agent, Meglitinide.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Repaglinide stimulates insulin release from the pancreas by blocking ATP-sensitive potassium channels in pancreatic beta cells. This depolarizes the cell membrane, leading to calcium influx and subsequent insulin secretion.  It is a short-acting insulin secretagogue. Its action is glucose-dependent; it works best when blood glucose levels are elevated and has little effect when levels are normal.


## **Alternate Names**

- International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Repaglinide
- Brand names: Prandin, NovoNorm, Repaglinide Teva, and others depending on the region/country.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Repaglinide lowers blood glucose levels by stimulating insulin secretion from the pancreas.  The effect is glucose-dependent, minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia when blood sugar levels are normal.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentration within one hour. Food intake slows absorption but increases the overall amount absorbed (AUC).
    - **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 enzymes.
    - **Elimination:** Mainly excreted in the bile and feces, with a small amount excreted in the urine.  Reduced clearance in patients with hepatic impairment.
- **Mode of Action:**  Repaglinide binds to and blocks ATP-sensitive potassium channels on the surface of pancreatic beta cells. This closure depolarizes the cell membrane, opening voltage-gated calcium channels.  The influx of calcium triggers the release of preformed insulin.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Binds to a distinct site on the ATP-sensitive potassium channel different from the sulfonylurea binding site.  Not an enzyme inhibitor.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Initial:** 0.5 mg orally before each main meal (preprandially) for patients with HbA1c < 8%.  1-2 mg orally before each main meal for patients with HbA1c ≥ 8% or those previously treated with other oral hypoglycemics.
- **Maintenance:** Adjust dose based on blood glucose response.  Double the dose (up to 4 mg) with each meal until adequate glycemic control is achieved.  Wait at least one week between dose adjustments.  Maximum daily dose: 16 mg. Skip the dose if a meal is skipped. Reduce dose if hypoglycemia occurs. Administer within 15-30 minutes before a meal.


#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age as safety and efficacy have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are necessary, but initiate therapy conservatively and titrate carefully, as elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of repaglinide, particularly those with renal or hepatic impairment. No studies in patients >75 years.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** For creatinine clearance (CrCl) 20-40 mL/min, start with 0.5 mg before meals and titrate slowly. For CrCl <20 mL/min, data are limited, and use with caution.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use cautiously. Initiate with a lower dose and adjust slowly due to reduced clearance. Monitor closely.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is essential. Dose adjustments may be needed depending on the specific comorbid conditions.  If the patient is under stress (e.g., infection, fever, trauma, or surgery), temporary discontinuation and insulin therapy may be necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  Clinical use cases outside of Type 2 diabetes mellitus are not indicated. Cases such as Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, or Emergency Situations might require adjusting insulin depending on the patient’s medical condition.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments are recommended when using strong CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 inhibitors or inducers.  Gemfibrozil is contraindicated. Avoid clopidogrel; if coadministration is unavoidable, initiate repaglinide at 0.5 mg before each meal and do not exceed 4 mg daily.  Limit the total daily dose to 6 mg with cyclosporine.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Hypoglycemia
- Upper respiratory tract infection, sore throat
- Headache
- Rhinitis
- Joint pain
- Nausea
- Diarrhea

- Liver dysfunction (jaundice)


### **Long-Term Effects:** No long-term effects have been reported.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Severe hypoglycemia and allergic reactions are ADRs requiring immediate intervention.



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to repaglinide
- Type 1 diabetes mellitus
- Diabetic ketoacidosis
- Severe hepatic impairment
- Concomitant use of gemfibrozil


## **Drug Interactions**

- Gemfibrozil: Contraindicated due to significant increase in repaglinide concentrations.
- Clopidogrel, Cyclosporine, Trimethoprim, Deferasirox: Increased risk of hypoglycemia due to CYP2C8 inhibition. Adjust repaglinide dose.
- CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, barbiturates, St. John's wort):  Decreased repaglinide efficacy.
- CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., azole antifungals, macrolide antibiotics): Increased risk of hypoglycemia.
- Beta-blockers: May mask symptoms of hypoglycemia.
- Alcohol: May potentiate the hypoglycemic effect.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Pregnancy Category C. Not recommended.  Potential embryotoxicity and abnormal limb development have been observed in animal studies.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Not recommended. Measurable levels of repaglinide have been detected in the breast milk of rats, with lowered blood glucose in offspring. It is unknown if repaglinide is excreted in human milk.
