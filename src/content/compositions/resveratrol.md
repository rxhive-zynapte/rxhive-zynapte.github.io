## **Usage**

- Resveratrol is primarily used as a dietary supplement and is not prescribed as a medication for treating specific medical conditions in India.  It's promoted for potential benefits related to aging, cardiovascular health, and metabolic function, but robust clinical evidence supporting these uses is lacking.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Resveratrol is classified as a phytoalexin, a type of natural phenol and antioxidant produced by some plants in response to injury or fungal infection. It doesn't fit neatly into traditional drug classifications like antibiotics or analgesics.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Resveratrol's mechanism of action isn't fully understood but is thought to involve activation of sirtuins, proteins implicated in cell longevity and metabolic regulation. It is also believed to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

## **Alternate Names**

-  *trans*-Resveratrol (the most biologically active form)
-  3,5,4'-Trihydroxy-trans-stilbene

- **Brand Names:**  Numerous brand names exist for resveratrol supplements, and availability varies depending on the region within India.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Resveratrol is thought to exert its effects through several mechanisms, including:
    - Sirtuin activation:  Influencing cellular processes related to aging, metabolism, and stress resistance.
    - Antioxidant activity: Protecting cells from oxidative damage.
    - Anti-inflammatory effects: Modulating inflammatory pathways.
    - Potential effects on lipid metabolism and blood pressure.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - Absorption: Resveratrol is absorbed orally but has low bioavailability due to rapid metabolism and elimination. Formulations using micronized or lipid carriers may improve absorption.
    - Metabolism: Primarily metabolized in the liver via glucuronidation and sulfation.
    - Elimination: Excreted mainly in urine and feces.


- **Mode of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**  The exact cellular/molecular mechanisms remain an area of active research. It is believed to activate SIRT1, which then modulates various downstream targets involved in metabolism and cell survival.


- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily through hepatic metabolism and subsequent renal and biliary excretion of metabolites.


## **Dosage**

Resveratrol is not a regulated medication in India, therefore standard dosing guidelines don't exist. Dosages in research and supplements vary widely.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Supplement dosages typically range from 250mg to 1500mg daily.  However, some studies have used doses up to 5g daily for short periods.

#### **Children:**

- Resveratrol supplementation is not typically recommended for children. There is insufficient safety data available.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients/Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment/Comorbid Conditions:** Insufficient data exist to provide specific dosing guidelines for these populations. Caution and medical supervision are advised.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Resveratrol is not currently used in standard clinical practice in India for the listed scenarios (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, etc.).


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- No established guidelines exist for dose adjustments based on renal/hepatic function or other specific factors.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

- Generally well-tolerated at lower doses. Gastrointestinal issues (diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain) are more likely with higher doses (above 2.5g daily).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

-  Some isolated reports exist of more serious side effects (e.g., fever, reduced blood cell counts), but their direct link to resveratrol requires further investigation.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Long-term safety data in humans are limited.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

-  Limited clinical data available.



## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to grapes or wine.
- Bleeding disorders.
- Hormone-sensitive cancers (e.g., breast, uterine, ovarian) due to potential estrogenic effects.
-  Pregnancy and breastfeeding: Insufficient safety data available. Avoid during pregnancy and while breastfeeding.


## **Drug Interactions**


- **Medications that slow blood clotting (Anticoagulant / Antiplatelet drugs):**  Resveratrol may increase bleeding risk.

- **Medications metabolized by the liver (CYP450 enzymes substrates/inducers/inhibitors):**  Resveratrol can interact with drugs metabolized by the liver, potentially altering their effects.


- **Other potential interactions:**  Limited data are available on interactions with other medications, OTC drugs, and supplements.  Caution is advised.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

-  Avoid resveratrol during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Insufficient safety data are available.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

(See sections above for detailed explanations.)



## **Popular Combinations**

-  No established popular drug combinations exist in clinical practice as resveratrol is not a standard medication.


## **Precautions**
