## **Usage**

Reviparin is an anticoagulant, specifically a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). It is prescribed for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients undergoing certain types of surgery, particularly orthopedic procedures like hip or knee replacements.  It is also used in some cases for the treatment of established VTE and for prophylaxis in medical patients at risk for thromboembolism.

## **Alternate Names**

The generic name is reviparin sodium. Clivarin is a common brand name.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Reviparin primarily works by accelerating the rate at which antithrombin inhibits factor Xa.  This inhibition reduces the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, thereby decreasing the formation of fibrin clots.  It has less of an effect on thrombin (Factor IIa) and platelet function than standard unfractionated heparin.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Reviparin is administered subcutaneously. Its bioavailability is close to 100%. Peak anti-Xa activity is achieved within 4-5 hours.  It has a half-life of about 5-6 hours. It is primarily cleared through renal mechanisms.  

**Mode of Action:** Reviparin binds to antithrombin, a naturally occurring anticoagulant. This binding enhances the activity of antithrombin, specifically its ability to inactivate factor Xa, a key enzyme in the coagulation cascade.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **VTE Prophylaxis (Surgical):**  3436 IU (0.6 mL) subcutaneously once daily, starting 12 hours before surgery for high-risk procedures (e.g., major orthopedic surgery). For lower-risk procedures, 1432 IU (0.25 mL) subcutaneously once daily, starting 2 hours preoperatively or at the start of immobilization.
* **VTE Treatment:** 175 IU/kg once daily subcutaneously. Dosage may be adjusted based on anti-Xa levels.

#### **Children:**

* **Pediatric patients above 3 months:**  30 IU/kg twice daily subcutaneously. 
* **Pediatric patients under 3 months:**  50 IU/kg twice daily subcutaneously.
* Monitor anti-Xa levels to adjust dosage as needed.  Pediatric dosing should always be guided by expert consultation and close monitoring.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Caution is advised, particularly for frail individuals or those with low body weight.  Renal function should be assessed.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Contraindicated in severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min). Dose adjustments are necessary in moderate renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised. Close monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with conditions that increase bleeding risk.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Surgical Procedures (especially orthopedic):** Used for VTE prophylaxis.
* **Trauma:** Used in immobilized trauma patients at risk of VTE.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on anti-Xa levels and renal function. Consult specific guidelines for adjustments in renal impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Bleeding (minor)
* Bruising
* Pain at injection site
* Hematoma


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Major bleeding
* Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)
* Spinal or epidural hematoma (with neuraxial anesthesia)
* Allergic reactions


### **Long-Term Effects**

Osteoporosis with long-term use.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to reviparin or other LMWHs or heparin.

* Conditions with high bleeding risk (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension, bacterial endocarditis).
* Severe renal impairment.
* Concurrent lumbar puncture, spinal, or epidural anesthesia.
* Neonates, especially premature infants.



## **Drug Interactions**

* Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin): Increased bleeding risk.
* Antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin): Increased bleeding risk.
* NSAIDs: Increased bleeding risk.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Use with caution.  Insufficient data to determine safety.
* **Breastfeeding:** Limited data suggests it's likely safe, but caution is advised. Monitor infant for signs of bleeding or bruising.
