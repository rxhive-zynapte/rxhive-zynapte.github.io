## **Usage**

Ribavirin is an antiviral medication primarily used in combination with other antiviral drugs, such as interferon or direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), to treat chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. It is also used to treat respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in hospitalized infants and children.  Ribavirin is classified as a nucleoside analogue.  Its mechanism of action involves interfering with viral RNA and DNA synthesis, inhibiting viral replication.


## **Alternate Names**

Ribavirin is also known by its brand names, including Copegus, Rebetol, Ribasphere, and Virazole.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Ribavirin's antiviral activity stems from its ability to interfere with viral RNA and DNA synthesis.  Multiple mechanisms contribute to this effect, including:

* **Inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH):** This enzyme is crucial for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) biosynthesis, essential for viral RNA synthesis.
* **Lethal mutagenesis:**  Ribavirin incorporation into viral RNA increases mutation rates, leading to non-viable viral progeny.
* **Immunomodulatory effects:**  Ribavirin may enhance T-cell mediated immunity and reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Ribavirin is well-absorbed orally, but undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism, resulting in approximately 45% bioavailability. Food increases its absorption.
* **Distribution:** Widely distributed throughout the body, including erythrocytes. Achieves high concentrations in respiratory secretions when administered via inhalation.
* **Metabolism:**  Primarily metabolized in the liver through phosphorylation and degradation pathways, with some renal excretion of unchanged drug.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated renally, with a prolonged half-life of around 12 days due to accumulation in erythrocytes.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **HCV (in combination with other antivirals):**  Dosage depends on body weight, HCV genotype, and the specific antiviral agent used in combination.  Ranges from 800 mg to 1400 mg daily, divided into two doses.
* **RSV (inhalation):**  6 g reconstituted in 300 mL sterile water, administered via small-particle aerosol generator (SPAG) for 12-18 hours daily for 3-7 days.


#### **Children:**

* **HCV:** Dosage is weight-based (approximately 15 mg/kg/day, divided into two doses). Pediatric dosing should be maintained even if the patient turns 18 during treatment. Oral solution should be used for children <47 kg.
* **RSV (inhalation):** Similar to adult RSV dosing, adjusted for body weight.



#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments are routinely recommended, but caution is advised due to potential for increased side effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reductions are necessary based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution advised, but no specific dose adjustments are generally made.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Close monitoring and dose adjustments may be needed for patients with cardiac disease.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Ribavirin's clinical use in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations is primarily confined to the treatment of severe RSV infections in infants and children.  Dosage and administration are as described above for RSV. Ribavirin is not indicated for these clinical use cases in adults with HCV.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are required for patients with renal impairment. See the "Special Cases" section. Dose reductions or discontinuation may also be necessary if specific adverse reactions (e.g., anemia) occur.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Fatigue, headache, dizziness, insomnia
* Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
* Dry mouth, cough, rash, itching
* Changes in taste/hearing
* Weight loss or gain


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Severe hemolytic anemia
* Worsening of cardiac disease
* Pancreatitis
* Depression, suicidal ideation


### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic anemia may occur with prolonged use.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe hemolytic anemia requires urgent medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

* Pregnancy and in male partners of pregnant women
* Hemoglobinopathies
* Autoimmune hepatitis
* Severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min)
* Hypersensitivity to ribavirin



## **Drug Interactions**

* Didanosine (contraindicated due to risk of fatal hepatic failure and pancreatitis)
* Zidovudine (increased risk of anemia)
* Azathioprine (increased azathioprine levels)
* Interferons (additive myelosuppression)



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Ribavirin is **contraindicated** in pregnancy and breastfeeding. It is classified as Pregnancy Category X due to its teratogenic effects. Effective contraception is mandatory during treatment and for 6 months after discontinuation for female patients and for 7 months after discontinuation for male patients.




## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Nucleoside analogue that inhibits viral RNA and DNA synthesis.
* **Side Effects:** Anemia, fatigue, headache, nausea, rash, itching.
* **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, hemoglobinopathies, autoimmune hepatitis, severe renal impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** Didanosine, zidovudine, azathioprine, interferons.

* Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) such as sofosbuvir, ledipasvir, daclatasvir


## **Precautions**

* Evaluate renal function in all patients before starting ribavirin.
* Monitor hemoglobin levels throughout treatment.
* Patients with cardiac disease should be closely monitored.
* Patients of childbearing potential must use effective contraception.
