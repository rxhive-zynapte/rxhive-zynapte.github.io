## **Usage**

Rifampicin is an antibiotic primarily used to treat tuberculosis (TB). It is also effective against several other bacterial infections, including leprosy, Legionnaires' disease, and methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) infections.  It's crucial to administer Rifampicin in combination with other antibiotics to prevent the development of drug resistance.  Its pharmacological classification is **antimycobacterial antibiotic**.

Rifampicin works by inhibiting bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for RNA synthesis. This action prevents bacterial gene transcription and protein synthesis, ultimately leading to bacterial cell death.


## **Alternate Names**

Rifampicin is also known internationally as Rifampin.  Brand names include Rifadin and Rimactane.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Rifampicin exerts its bactericidal effect by binding to the bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase beta subunit, effectively blocking RNA synthesis. This inhibits bacterial protein production, resulting in cell death.  

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Rifampicin is well-absorbed orally, with peak serum concentrations reached approximately 2-4 hours after administration.  Absorption is best when taken on an empty stomach.
* **Distribution:**  The drug is widely distributed throughout the body, reaching therapeutic levels in various tissues and fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver, forming active and inactive metabolites.
* **Elimination:** Excreted in bile and urine, giving body fluids an orange-red color.


**Mode of Action:** Rifampicin specifically targets the bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, inhibiting transcription and thus protein synthesis. This mechanism involves binding to the beta-subunit of the enzyme, preventing chain elongation beyond 2-3 nucleotides.  The drug does *not* inhibit mammalian RNA polymerases.

**Elimination Pathways:** Rifampicin is primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion. A smaller portion is excreted unchanged in the urine.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  600 mg once daily.  For severe infections, dosage may be increased up to 1200 mg daily, divided into 2-4 doses. Administer on an empty stomach.

#### **Children:** 10-20 mg/kg daily, not to exceed 600 mg/day. Administer on an empty stomach. For infants under one month, dosing requires careful consideration.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Dosage adjustments may be necessary due to age-related decline in renal function. Monitor renal function closely.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce the dose or increase the dosing interval in patients with significant renal dysfunction.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Reduce the dose or avoid use in patients with severe liver disease. Monitor liver function tests closely.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Exercise caution in patients with diabetes, HIV, or other conditions, as drug interactions can occur.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing for specific clinical situations may vary and should be determined by the attending physician or in consultation with an infectious diseases specialist.  Specific guidelines for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not explicitly defined.  Tuberculosis treatment guidelines often recommend combination therapy.  


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be required based on individual patient factors, including renal or hepatic dysfunction, concomitant medications, and other medical conditions.  Therapeutic drug monitoring can be beneficial in optimizing dosage and minimizing toxicity.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Discoloration of body fluids (orange-red)
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Loss of appetite
* Abdominal discomfort
* Headache
* Fatigue

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Jaundice (liver toxicity)
* Flu-like syndrome
* Thrombocytopenia
* Acute renal failure
* *Clostridium difficile*-associated colitis
* Severe allergic reactions

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term use of rifampicin can lead to hepatotoxicity and other organ damage.  Regular monitoring of liver function and complete blood count is recommended.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Significant ADRs include severe hepatotoxicity, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure, requiring immediate medical intervention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to rifamycins
* Concurrent use of ritonavir-boosted saquinavir or certain other antiviral medications
* Active liver disease


## **Drug Interactions**

Rifampicin is a potent inducer of CYP450 enzymes, leading to numerous drug interactions.  It can decrease the effectiveness of:

* Oral contraceptives
* Warfarin
* Antiretrovirals
* Antifungals
* Some antibiotics
* Anticonvulsants
* Corticosteroids
* Other medications metabolized by the CYP450 system


Interactions with OTC drugs, supplements (e.g., St. John's wort), and food (e.g., grapefruit juice) are also possible.  Alcohol consumption should be avoided during treatment.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category: C (FDA). Rifampicin can cross the placental barrier and may cause harm to the fetus.  Use during pregnancy only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.

Rifampicin is excreted in breast milk.  A decision should be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or the drug, considering the importance of the drug to the mother.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase.
* **Side Effects:** Discolored body fluids, nausea, vomiting, hepatotoxicity (rare).
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, concurrent use of certain antivirals, active liver disease.
* **Drug Interactions:** Numerous, including oral contraceptives, warfarin, antiretrovirals.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; risk to fetus and infant.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 600 mg daily; Children: 10-20 mg/kg daily.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests, complete blood count.


## **Popular Combinations**

Rifampicin is often used in combination with isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for the treatment of tuberculosis.  These combinations enhance efficacy and prevent the development of drug resistance.


## **Precautions**

* Monitor for liver toxicity and other side effects.
* Closely manage patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
* Patients should use alternative forms of contraception.
* Avoid alcohol.
