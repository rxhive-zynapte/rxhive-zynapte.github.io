## **Usage**

Risedronate is primarily prescribed for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. It is also used to treat osteoporosis in men and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (osteoporosis caused by long-term use of steroid medications like prednisone). Additionally, it is indicated for Paget's disease of bone, a condition characterized by abnormal bone remodeling.  Risedronate is classified as a bisphosphonate.  It works by inhibiting osteoclast activity, the cells responsible for bone resorption.  This leads to a decrease in bone breakdown and helps to maintain bone density.

## **Alternate Names**

Risedronate is also known as risedronate sodium.  A popular brand name under which it's marketed is Actonel.  Atelvia is the brand name for the delayed-release formulation.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Risedronate binds to hydroxyapatite, the mineral component of bone.  This binding preferentially targets areas of active bone remodeling.  It then inhibits osteoclast activity, reducing bone resorption. Although risedronate does not directly stimulate bone formation, by decreasing bone turnover, it helps maintain bone mass and reduces the risk of fractures.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Absorption is affected by food and other medications.  Oral bioavailability is low (approximately 0.6%).  It should be taken on an empty stomach with only water at least 30 minutes before any other food, drink, or medication. The delayed-release formulation should be taken after breakfast.
* **Distribution:**  Risedronate has a high affinity for bone tissue.
* **Metabolism:** Risedronate is not metabolized in the liver.
* **Elimination:**  Primarily excreted unchanged in the urine.  A smaller portion is eliminated in the feces. Dosage adjustments might be needed for patients with impaired renal function.

**Mode of Action:** Risedronate's primary mode of action involves inhibiting farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase within osteoclasts. This enzyme is crucial for the prenylation of small GTPase signaling proteins, which are essential for osteoclast function and survival.  By inhibiting this enzyme, risedronate disrupts osteoclast activity and promotes apoptosis (programmed cell death) of osteoclasts, thereby reducing bone resorption.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Osteoporosis (Prevention and Treatment):** 5 mg orally once daily, 35 mg orally once weekly, 75 mg orally on two consecutive days monthly, or 150 mg orally once a month.
* **Paget's Disease:** 30 mg orally once daily for two months.
* **Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis:** 5 mg orally once daily.


#### **Children:**  Risedronate is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is needed for mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance â‰¥ 30 mL/min). Risedronate is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min).
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment is needed.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Risedronate is not typically used in acute clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary role is in the long-term management of chronic bone diseases.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Gastrointestinal upset (heartburn, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation), musculoskeletal pain, headache.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Esophageal irritation or ulceration, osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical femoral fractures, atrial fibrillation.

### **Long-Term Effects:**
Potential for long-term musculoskeletal pain, rare cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to risedronate
* Hypocalcemia
* Inability to sit or stand upright for at least 30 minutes
* Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min)
* Pregnancy and lactation

## **Drug Interactions**

Antacids containing calcium, magnesium, or aluminum can interfere with the absorption of risedronate.  Concomitant use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects. There are no significant CYP450 interactions.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Risedronate is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It is classified as Pregnancy Category C, indicating potential risk to the fetus.  It is unknown if risedronate is excreted in breast milk.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.
* **Side Effects:**  GI upset, musculoskeletal pain, esophageal irritation, osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical femoral fractures.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, hypocalcemia, esophageal abnormalities, severe renal impairment, pregnancy, breastfeeding.
* **Drug Interactions:** Antacids, NSAIDs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
* **Dosage:** See dosage section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Bone mineral density, serum calcium and phosphate levels, alkaline phosphatase.

## **Popular Combinations**

Risedronate is sometimes prescribed in combination with calcium and vitamin D supplements to ensure adequate intake for bone health.


## **Precautions**

* Patients should be adequately hydrated.
* Ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D intake.
* Monitor for signs of esophageal irritation.
* Dental exams prior to starting therapy are recommended due to the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.
