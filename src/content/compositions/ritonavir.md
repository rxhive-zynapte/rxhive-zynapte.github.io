## **Usage**

Ritonavir is an antiretroviral medication, specifically a protease inhibitor, primarily used in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.  It inhibits the activity of HIV-1 protease, an enzyme crucial for viral replication, thus preventing the formation of mature infectious viral particles.  Although initially used as a standalone protease inhibitor, ritonavir is now more commonly used in lower doses as a pharmacokinetic booster for other protease inhibitors due to its potent inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, the enzyme responsible for metabolizing these drugs.  This boosting effect increases the plasma concentrations and prolongs the half-life of other protease inhibitors, allowing for less frequent dosing and improved efficacy.


## **Alternate Names**

Ritonavir is also known by its brand name, Norvir.  There are no widely recognized international or regional variations of the name.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Ritonavir exerts its antiviral effect by binding to the active site of the HIV-1 protease enzyme, thereby preventing the cleavage of viral polyprotein precursors necessary for the assembly of infectious virions. This leads to the production of immature, non-infectious viral particles. As a pharmacokinetic booster, ritonavir inhibits CYP3A4, increasing plasma concentrations of co-administered protease inhibitors.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Ritonavir is well absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 2-4 hours. Food increases the bioavailability of the drug. Ritonavir is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6. It undergoes both hepatic and renal excretion, with the majority eliminated in feces. The half-life of ritonavir when used as a booster is shorter than when used as a primary protease inhibitor.

**Mode of Action:** Ritonavir acts by competitive inhibition of HIV-1 protease. It binds to the active site of the enzyme, preventing the binding and subsequent cleavage of the viral polyprotein substrates.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **As a pharmacokinetic booster:** 100 mg to 400 mg once or twice daily, co-administered with another protease inhibitor. The specific dose depends on the co-administered protease inhibitor. 

* **As a primary protease inhibitor:** Initially 300 mg twice daily orally with food, increasing by 100 mg twice daily every 2-3 days up to a maximum of 600 mg twice daily.


#### **Children:**

Dosing in children (over 2 years of age) is based on body surface area (BSA):  350 mg/m² to 400 mg/m² twice daily orally with food, not to exceed 600 mg twice daily. The oral solution is recommended for younger children or those unable to swallow capsules. Refer to pediatric dosage guidelines based on BSA for precise dosing.  Ritonavir is not recommended for children under 2 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustment is required based on age, but caution is advised due to the increased likelihood of age-related organ dysfunction. 

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is recommended as ritonavir may be used with caution as a pharmacokinetic enhancer in patients with renal insufficiency.


* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Ritonavir should not be given as a pharmacokinetic enhancer to patients with decompensated liver disease. Caution is required in patients with stable severe hepatic impairment. Dose adjustment depends on the specific protease inhibitor co-administered.


* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Close monitoring is recommended for patients with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or cardiovascular disease.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  

Ritonavir is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations outside of its role in HIV treatment.  It doesn't have properties relevant to these scenarios like sedation, analgesia, or cardiovascular support.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary based on specific patient factors such as hepatic or renal impairment, concomitant medications, and the specific protease inhibitor co-administered.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain,  headache, fatigue, taste disturbances, paresthesias (numbness or tingling), dizziness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Pancreatitis, cardiac arrhythmias,  hepatotoxicity, severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), hypersensitivity reactions, new-onset diabetes or worsening of existing diabetes,  hyperlipidemia, changes in body fat distribution, increased bleeding in hemophiliacs.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic complications can include  hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, diabetes, changes in body fat distribution, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Clinically significant ADRs include pancreatitis, hepatic dysfunction, severe skin reactions, and cardiac arrhythmias, requiring prompt discontinuation of ritonavir and supportive care.




## **Contraindications**

Ritonavir is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to ritonavir or any of its components,  decompensated liver disease, and concomitant use with medications highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance where elevated concentrations are associated with serious or life-threatening events (e.g., alfuzosin, ranolazine, amiodarone, triazolam, midazolam (oral), lovastatin, simvastatin, etc.).  It is also contraindicated with potent CYP3A inducers that could significantly reduce ritonavir concentrations, leading to loss of virologic response.


## **Drug Interactions**

Ritonavir has numerous drug interactions. It inhibits CYP3A, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and P-glycoprotein, increasing concentrations of drugs metabolized by these pathways. It can also induce certain enzymes, leading to decreased concentrations of other drugs. Clinically significant interactions can occur with numerous medications, including antiarrhythmics,  sedative-hypnotics, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors,  anticonvulsants, certain antidepressants,  and some immunosuppressants.  Refer to a comprehensive drug interaction resource for detailed information before co-prescribing. Concomitant use with certain herbal products (e.g., St. John's wort) and food (e.g., grapefruit juice) should also be avoided.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Ritonavir is generally considered safe to use during pregnancy when the benefits outweigh the risks.  The oral solution should be avoided due to its ethanol content. While ritonavir is excreted in breast milk, it is present in low amounts. The WHO recommends shared decision-making about breastfeeding in mothers living with HIV.  However, the CDC, American Academy of Pediatrics, and the manufacturer advise against breastfeeding.
