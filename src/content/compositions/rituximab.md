## **Usage**

Rituximab is prescribed for a variety of conditions, including:

* **Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL):**  Specifically, it is used for follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and other B-cell NHL types. It's used in both first-line treatment (in combination with chemotherapy) and for relapsed or refractory cases.
* **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL):**  Typically used in combination with chemotherapy.
* **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA):** In combination with methotrexate, for adults with moderate to severely active RA who haven't responded well to TNF antagonist therapies.
* **Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) and Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA):**  For both induction and maintenance therapy.
* **Pemphigus Vulgaris (PV):**  A severe autoimmune blistering skin disease.
* **Other Autoimmune Conditions:**  Rituximab is also sometimes used off-label (meaning for conditions not officially approved) for various other autoimmune conditions, such as  immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), autoimmune hemolytic anemia, myasthenia gravis, lupus nephritis, and multiple sclerosis.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody.  More specifically, it's a chimeric (mouse/human) monoclonal antibody targeting the CD20 antigen.

**Mechanism of Action:** Rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen found on the surface of B lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). This binding triggers a cascade of immune responses that lead to the depletion of B cells.  These mechanisms include antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and apoptosis (programmed cell death) of B cells.


## **Alternate Names**

**International and Regional Variations:**  Generally, "Rituximab" is the internationally recognized generic name.

**Brand Names:** Rituxan, MabThera, Riximyo, Truxima, Ruxience.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Rituximab's primary pharmacodynamic effect is the depletion of B cells, which play a significant role in the immune system, including antibody production and antigen presentation. This B-cell depletion is the basis of its therapeutic effect in both cancers like NHL and CLL and autoimmune diseases.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Administered intravenously, so bioavailability is 100%.
* **Distribution:** Distributes mainly into the vascular and extravascular spaces.
* **Metabolism:**  The metabolism of rituximab is not fully understood, but it likely involves the reticuloendothelial system and proteolytic degradation, similar to other immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies.
* **Elimination:** Rituximab has a relatively long half-life, ranging from several days to weeks, depending on the dose and the individual. The elimination pathways are not entirely clear, but thought to be similar to endogenous IgG clearance.

**Mode of Action:** Rituximab binds specifically to the CD20 transmembrane protein found on pre-B and mature B lymphocytes. It doesn't bind to stem cells, pro-B cells, or plasma cells.  The mechanisms by which rituximab depletes B cells after binding to CD20 include:

* **Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC):**  The Fc portion of rituximab binds to Fc receptors on immune effector cells (like natural killer cells and macrophages), triggering these cells to destroy the targeted B cells.
* **Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC):** Rituximab activates the complement cascade, leading to the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) on B cells, causing cell lysis.
* **Apoptosis:**  Rituximab may also directly induce apoptosis in B cells.

**Receptor Binding:** Binds specifically to the CD20 antigen.

**Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Rituximab does not primarily work via enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation.


## **Dosage**

Rituximab dosing is highly variable depending on the indication and patient-specific factors.  The following are general guidelines, and it is essential to consult product information for the latest recommendations.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Dosage varies considerably depending on the indication. Common regimens include:

* **NHL (as monotherapy):** 375 mg/m² IV infusion once weekly for 4 weeks; retreatment may be given at the same dose and schedule.
* **NHL (with chemotherapy):** 375 mg/m² IV infusion on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle.
* **CLL (with chemotherapy):**  Complex dosing; please refer to specific CLL treatment protocols.
* **RA:** Two 1,000 mg IV infusions separated by two weeks, then repeated every 16-24 weeks based on clinical response.
* **GPA/MPA:**  375 mg/m² IV infusion once weekly for 4 weeks (induction); followed by maintenance dosing every six months.
* **PV:** 1,000 mg IV once, then repeated in two weeks; maintenance every 16 weeks.

#### **Children:**

* **GPA/MPA (2 years and older):** 375 mg/m² IV infusion once weekly for 4 weeks, with premedication.
* **Other indications:** Safety and efficacy in children have not been established for all conditions.  Specific protocols and guidelines should be consulted for other pediatric uses.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustment is typically required based solely on age. However, close monitoring for side effects is important.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustment is usually necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustment is usually necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Dose adjustments may be needed depending on the specific comorbidity.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Rituximab is not typically used in clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with decreased renal or hepatic function, or other comorbid conditions. Consider also pre-existing infections and bone marrow function. Closely monitor patients.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Infusion reactions (fever, chills, rash, itching, shortness of breath, low blood pressure)
* Infections (due to B-cell depletion)
* Fatigue
* Nausea
* Headache
* Low white blood cell counts (neutropenia, leukopenia)
* Low red blood cell counts (anemia)
* Low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia)


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) - a rare, serious brain infection.
* Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS)
* Hepatitis B reactivation
* Severe infusion reactions
* Heart problems
* Lung problems
* Severe skin reactions


### **Long-Term Effects:**
Prolonged immunosuppression and increased risk of infections, along with secondary malignancies and other delayed effects.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
As described above. 


## **Contraindications**
