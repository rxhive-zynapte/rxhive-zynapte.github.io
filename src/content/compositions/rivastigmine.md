      more than three days, restart at the initial dose and titrate upwards
      again.

## **Usage**

- Rivastigmine is prescribed for mild to moderate dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.  It can also be used for severe Alzheimer's dementia.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Cholinesterase inhibitor.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Rivastigmine increases levels of acetylcholine in the brain by reversibly inhibiting both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), enzymes that break down acetylcholine. This improved cholinergic function helps to alleviate some cognitive symptoms of dementia.

## **Alternate Names**

- No commonly used alternate generic names.
- **Brand Names:** ExelonÂ®.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Rivastigmine enhances cholinergic neurotransmission by inhibiting AChE and BuChE, leading to increased acetylcholine concentrations at cholinergic synapses.  This can improve cognitive function, such as memory and attention, in patients with dementia.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Well-absorbed orally.  Food intake can delay the time to peak plasma concentration. Transdermal absorption is slower and more consistent.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by cholinesterase-mediated hydrolysis to a decarbamylated metabolite, which has minimal AChE inhibitory activity.  CYP450 enzymes play a minor role.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted mainly through the kidneys as metabolites.  Less than 1% is excreted in feces. No significant accumulation occurs in patients with Alzheimer's.
- **Mode of Action:** Rivastigmine binds reversibly to and inhibits AChE and BuChE.  This prevents the breakdown of acetylcholine, increasing its availability in the synaptic cleft and prolonging its action on postsynaptic cholinergic receptors.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Rivastigmine acts as a competitive inhibitor of AChE and BuChE. It modulates cholinergic neurotransmission by increasing acetylcholine levels.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of metabolites.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Oral:** Initial dose: 1.5 mg twice daily with meals. Titrate upwards in increments of 1.5 mg twice daily every 2 weeks, based on tolerability, to a maximum of 6 mg twice daily.
- **Transdermal:** Initial dose: 4.6 mg/24 hours patch. After 4 weeks, if tolerated, increase to 9.5 mg/24 hours, the minimum effective dose. After a further 4 weeks, the dose can be increased to a maximum of 13.3 mg/24 hours, if needed.

#### **Children:**

- Rivastigmine is not recommended for use in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Titrate cautiously based on tolerability.  No specific dosage adjustments are routinely recommended based on age alone.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Titrate cautiously based on tolerability. No specific dosage adjustments are routinely recommended for mild to moderate renal impairment.  Close monitoring is advised.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Titrate cautiously based on tolerability.  No specific dosage adjustments are routinely recommended for mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  Close monitoring is advised. The use of rivastigmine is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider the potential for drug interactions and exacerbations of pre-existing conditions (e.g., cardiac conduction abnormalities, respiratory diseases, peptic ulcer disease).

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Rivastigmine is not indicated for use in situations such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest. Its usage is primarily for chronic management of dementia.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments should be made based on individual patient tolerability, especially in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, low body weight (<50 kg), or significant comorbidities.  If treatment is interrupted for more than three days, re-initiate at the starting dose and titrate as described above.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, weight loss, abdominal pain, weakness, dizziness, headache, insomnia, increased sweating, tremors.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing or swallowing), gastrointestinal bleeding, bradycardia, syncope, heart block, seizures, worsening of Parkinsonian symptoms, hallucinations, aggressive behavior.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Potential for chronic gastrointestinal issues, weight loss, and cardiovascular effects with prolonged use. Regular monitoring is essential.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Serious allergic reactions, bradycardia, syncope, gastrointestinal bleeding, seizures. These require immediate medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to rivastigmine or other carbamates.
- History of allergic contact dermatitis to rivastigmine transdermal patch.
- Severe hepatic impairment.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Anticholinergic drugs (may antagonize the effects of rivastigmine).
- Cholinergic drugs (additive effects).
- Beta-blockers (increased risk of bradycardia).
- Drugs that prolong the QT interval (increased risk of arrhythmias).
- Metoclopramide.
- Neuromuscular blocking agents (potentiation of neuromuscular blockade).
- Nicotine (increases clearance of rivastigmine).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  The safety of rivastigmine in human pregnancy has not been established. Animal studies do not indicate teratogenic effects. Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.
- **Breastfeeding:** It is unknown if rivastigmine is excreted in human milk.  Not recommended for use during breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Cholinesterase inhibitor, increases acetylcholine levels.
- **Side Effects:**  Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, weight loss.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, allergic contact dermatitis to the patch, severe hepatic impairment.
- **Drug Interactions:** Anticholinergics, cholinergics, beta-blockers.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Not recommended during breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:**  Oral: 1.5-6 mg twice daily; Transdermal: 4.6-13.3 mg/24 hours.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Cognitive function, weight, heart rate, blood pressure, gastrointestinal symptoms, skin reactions.


## **Popular Combinations**

Rivastigmine is typically used as monotherapy. Combinations with other drugs for dementia are not routinely recommended.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Monitor for allergies, cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and renal/hepatic function.
- **Specific Populations:** As described above.
