Rofecoxib, formerly marketed under the brand name Vioxx, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that was withdrawn from the market in 2004 due to an increased risk of cardiovascular events.  This information is provided for historical and educational purposes only.  **Rofecoxib should not be prescribed or used clinically.**

## **Usage**

- **Previously Prescribed for:** Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, acute pain, primary dysmenorrhea, and migraine attacks.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), COX-2 inhibitor.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Rofecoxib selectively inhibited cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme responsible for the production of prostaglandins, which mediate inflammation and pain.  By inhibiting COX-2, rofecoxib reduced the production of these prostaglandins, thereby alleviating pain and inflammation.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Rofecoxib
- **Brand Name:** Vioxx (discontinued)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Rofecoxib exerted its therapeutic effects by primarily inhibiting COX-2.  This led to a reduction in prostaglandin synthesis, primarily PGE2, which is involved in mediating inflammation, pain, and fever.  COX-1 inhibition was minimal at therapeutic doses.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Rofecoxib was well-absorbed orally, with a bioavailability of approximately 93%.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP enzymes, specifically CYP3A4 and potentially some minor metabolism by CYP1A2, 2C9, and 2C8. Additionally, O-glucuronidation occurred via UGT enzymes 2B7 and 2B15.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism with subsequent renal excretion of metabolites.  The elimination half-life was approximately 17 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing.



## **Dosage**

**The following dosage information is historical and reflects recommendations when rofecoxib was available.  It is not to be used for current clinical practice.**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- **Osteoarthritis:** 12.5 mg orally once daily, may increase to a maximum of 25 mg once daily.
- **Rheumatoid Arthritis:** 25 mg orally once daily.
- **Acute Pain/Migraine:** 50 mg orally once daily for no more than 5 days.

#### **Children:**
- Use was not recommended for children under 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:**  Lower starting doses were recommended.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments were recommended in severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction to 12.5 mg daily was recommended.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

**The following is historical information and is not to be used for current clinical practice.**

- Dosage guidelines existed for specific clinical scenarios such as knee replacement surgery but are not relevant due to the drug's withdrawal.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments were needed for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
- Headache, dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, upper respiratory infection, indigestion, heartburn, fluid retention, edema.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Myocardial infarction, stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration, perforation, anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis.


### **Long-Term Effects**
- Increased risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events with prolonged use was the primary reason for the drug's withdrawal.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
- Serious cardiovascular events, gastrointestinal bleeding, severe skin reactions.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to rofecoxib, history of aspirin or NSAID induced asthma or urticaria, severe renal impairment, coronary artery bypass graft surgery.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Aspirin and other NSAIDs: Increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicity.
- Warfarin: Increased risk of bleeding.
- Methotrexate: Increased methotrexate levels and toxicity.
- Theophylline: Increased theophylline levels.
- Rifampin: Decreased rofecoxib levels.
- ACE inhibitors: Potential for reduced antihypertensive effect.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Avoid in third trimester. Use only if clearly needed during the first and second trimesters.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Not known if excreted in human milk.  Use with caution.
