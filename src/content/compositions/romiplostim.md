## **Usage**

- Romiplostim is primarily prescribed for the treatment of chronic Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP), a condition characterized by low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) that increases bleeding risk. It is specifically indicated for adult patients who have not responded adequately to other treatments like corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy. It has also shown efficacy in treating children 1 year and older with chronic ITP.  Additionally, romiplostim is approved for use in emergency situations involving acute radiation syndrome (ARS) where myelosuppressive doses of radiation have been absorbed.

- **Pharmacological Classification**: Thrombopoietin Receptor Agonist.

- **Mechanism of Action**: Romiplostim mimics the action of thrombopoietin, a naturally occurring hormone that stimulates the production of platelets in the bone marrow. By binding to and activating the thrombopoietin receptor, romiplostim increases platelet production, reducing bleeding risk in ITP.

## **Alternate Names**

- International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Romiplostim

- **Brand Names**: Nplate

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Romiplostim binds to the thrombopoietin receptor (c-Mpl) on megakaryocytes, the precursor cells to platelets, and stimulates their proliferation and differentiation. This leads to an increased production of platelets.  The effect on the body is a raise in platelet count, thus mitigating bleeding risk. Note: Achieving normal platelet levels isn't the typical therapeutic goal.

- **Pharmacokinetics**:
    - **Absorption**: Administered subcutaneously, romiplostim exhibits dose-proportional absorption. 
    - **Metabolism**: The specific metabolic pathways are not fully characterized, but it is thought that romiplostim is cleared primarily through the same mechanisms as endogenous thrombopoietin, potentially involving target-mediated elimination via binding to the thrombopoietin receptor on platelets.
    - **Elimination**: Romiplostim's elimination is multiphasic, with a terminal half-life typically ranging from 1 to 7 days.

- **Mode of Action**: Romiplostim acts as a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, binding to and activating the c-Mpl receptor on the surface of megakaryocytes. This activation triggers intracellular signaling pathways that promote megakaryocyte growth and maturation, ultimately leading to an increased production of platelets.

- **Receptor Binding**:  Binds to the transmembrane domain of the thrombopoietin receptor (c-Mpl).

- **Elimination Pathways**: Target-mediated elimination via binding to c-Mpl on platelets and subsequent degradation.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial Dose: 1 mcg/kg subcutaneously once weekly.
- Dose Adjustments: Adjust the weekly dose by increments of 1 mcg/kg until a platelet count of at least 50 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L is reached. The maximum weekly dose is 10 mcg/kg. Periodic monitoring and adjustments are required to maintain optimal platelet counts.

#### **Children (1 year and older):**

- Initial Dose: 1 mcg/kg subcutaneously once weekly.
- Dose Adjustments: Similar to adults, adjust the weekly dose by increments of 1 mcg/kg until a platelet count of at least 50 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L is reached, not exceeding a maximum weekly dose of 10 mcg/kg. Monitor platelet counts weekly until stable, then monthly.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**:  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended, though patients should be carefully monitored due to the potential increased bleeding risk associated with age and other potential co-morbidities.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**:  No specific dosage adjustments are routinely required, but use with caution and monitor closely.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Use with caution, especially in moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score â‰¥ 7), due to increased risk of portal vein thrombosis. Closely monitor platelet counts. 
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Careful consideration and closer monitoring are warranted, especially for patients with a history of blood clots or thromboembolic events.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) Due to Myelosuppressive Radiation Exposure**: 10 mcg/kg as a single subcutaneous injection administered as soon as possible after exposure.

- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations (other than radiation exposure)**:  Romiplostim is not indicated for these situations. Dosage adjustments in these cases are applicable to pre-existing ITP treatment with romiplostim and will be guided by the patient's platelet counts and clinical condition.  Consult hematology if guidance is required.

### **Dosage Adjustments**:

- Dosage adjustments are based on the platelet count response.  Increase the dose incrementally if the desired platelet level isn't achieved.  Reduce the dose if the platelet count exceeds the therapeutic range. Always adhere to the maximum weekly dose limit.  Consider patient-specific factors, including comorbidities like hepatic or renal dysfunction, when adjusting doses.
