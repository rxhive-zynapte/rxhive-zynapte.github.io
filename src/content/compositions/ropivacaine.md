  Ropivacaine is prescribed for local or regional anesthesia and acute pain
  management. It is a local anesthetic, specifically an amino amide-type local
  anesthetic.  Ropivacaine works by blocking sodium channels, which inhibits
  nerve impulse propagation, thus preventing the sensation of pain.

## **Usage**

Ropivacaine is prescribed for local or regional anesthesia and acute pain management. It is a local anesthetic, specifically an amino amide-type local anesthetic.  Ropivacaine works by blocking sodium channels, which inhibits nerve impulse propagation, thus preventing the sensation of pain.

## **Alternate Names**

Ropivacaine hydrochloride monohydrate is the chemical name. Common brand names include Naropin®, Naropin® Polyamp, and Naropin® SDV.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ropivacaine reversibly binds to voltage-gated sodium channels in nerve axons. This action blocks sodium influx, preventing depolarization and subsequent nerve impulse conduction, resulting in local anesthesia. It preferentially binds to the inactivated state of sodium channels, leading to a greater effect on rapidly firing neurons, like those transmitting pain signals.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Absorption depends on the administration route and dose.  Epidural administration results in slower absorption compared to peripheral nerve blocks. The addition of vasoconstrictors, like epinephrine, can decrease the rate of absorption and prolong the duration of action.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 enzymes, with 3-hydroxyropivacaine being the major metabolite.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through renal excretion, with a small portion excreted in bile. Elimination is slower in neonates and patients with hepatic or renal impairment.

**Mode of Action:** Ropivacaine's mode of action involves binding to the intracellular portion of voltage-gated sodium channels in nerve axons. This interaction inhibits sodium ion influx, preventing depolarization and blocking nerve impulse propagation. It demonstrates some selectivity for sensory over motor neurons, allowing for analgesia with reduced motor blockade at lower concentrations.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Ropivacaine primarily interacts with voltage-gated sodium channels.  It does not directly inhibit enzymes or modulate neurotransmitters.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Dosing varies based on the procedure and desired effect. Typical dosages are:

* **Epidural for surgery:** 15-30 mL of 0.5% solution, 15-25 mL of 0.75% solution, or 15-20 mL of 1% solution for lumbar procedures. 20-30 mL of 0.5% or 15-20 mL of 0.75% solution for Cesarean section.
* **Major nerve block:** 35-50 mL of 0.5% or 10-40 mL of 0.75% solution.
* **Field block:** 1-40 mL of 0.5% solution.
* **Postoperative pain management (epidural infusion):** 6-14 mL/hr of 0.2% solution.
* **Labor Pain (epidural):** Initial bolus of 10-20 mL of 0.2%, followed by continuous infusion at 6-10 mL/hr or intermittent top-ups of 20-30 mg.

Maximum recommended dose for a single procedure is generally 225mg, and the maximum cumulative dose over 24 hours is up to 770mg, although this should be used cautiously in debilitated patients. For prolonged administration (e.g. &gt;70 hours) caution should be used, especially in debilitated patients.

#### **Children:**

* Dosing is weight-based, typically starting at 2 mg/kg for caudal epidural and up to 3 mg/kg in children older than 4 years. Volume adjustments are necessary to achieve appropriate sensory block distribution.
* **Neonates:** require careful monitoring due to reduced elimination rates. Dosage recommendations vary, and lower doses are necessary in this age group. For peripheral nerve blocks, Single injections should not exceed 2.5-3.0 mg/kg.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Reduced doses are recommended due to age-related physiological changes.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are necessary depending on the degree of impairment. Close monitoring is crucial.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Reduced doses are indicated due to decreased metabolism. Close monitoring for toxicity is essential.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dose adjustments may be necessary based on specific conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes etc. Consult current guidelines for specific dosage recommendations.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Intubation:** Facilitation of intubation is not a typical use case for ropivacaine. Other anesthetic agents may be preferred. 
* **Surgical Procedures:** Used for various surgical procedures as a regional or local anesthetic, administered via epidural, peripheral nerve block, or local infiltration.
* **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not typically used directly for mechanical ventilation, but can be utilized for pain management in ventilated patients.
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Primarily used in ICU for postoperative or chronic pain management, frequently administered via epidural infusions or peripheral nerve blocks.
* **Emergency Situations:** Ropivacaine is not generally the first-line agent for most emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Adjustments are necessary for patients with renal/hepatic impairment, elderly patients, and those with certain comorbid conditions. Consult specific guidelines and recommendations. Consider genetic polymorphisms affecting CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 activity when adjusting doses.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, headache, back pain, fever, itching, numbness, tingling, dizziness, blurred vision, tremors, paraesthesia, anxiety, insomnia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (hives, difficulty breathing, swelling), methemoglobinemia (pale or blue skin, shortness of breath, confusion), seizures, CNS toxicity (anxiety, restlessness, tremors, seizures, coma), cardiovascular effects (bradycardia, hypotension, cardiac arrest).


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chondrolysis (cartilage damage) has been reported with prolonged intra-articular infusions.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, methemoglobinemia, CNS toxicity, cardiovascular collapse, local neural injury.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to ropivacaine or amide-type local anesthetics, paracervical block in obstetrics, intravenous regional anesthesia (Bier block),  severe hypotension or hypovolemia, severe heart block.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** Fluvoxamine, enoxacin, and other potent inhibitors can increase ropivacaine plasma levels.
* **Other Local Anesthetics and Amide-Type Antiarrhythmics (e.g., lidocaine, mexiletine):** Additive toxic effects.
* **Class III Antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone):** Increased risk of cardiac effects.

Concomitant use with drugs that could induce methemoglobinemia should be avoided or used with caution, these include but are not limited to nitrates/nitrites, some local anesthetics, some antibiotics, some antimalarials, and some other medications (such as acetaminophen).

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Ropivacaine is generally considered safe during pregnancy (FDA category B) but fetal heart rate should be monitored.  It is present in breast milk, and its effects on neonates are not fully established.  Consult current guidelines and inform patient of potential risks and benefits.

## **Drug Profile Summary**
