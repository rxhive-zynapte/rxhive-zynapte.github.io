## **Usage**

- Rosehip is primarily used for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It's believed to help relieve pain and improve mobility in these conditions.  It's also used for other conditions, although more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness in these areas.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Herbal supplement, anti-inflammatory agent, antioxidant.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Rosehip contains several active compounds, including galactolipids (GOPO®), polyphenols, and vitamin C, that contribute to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.  It's thought to work by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines and enzymes that break down cartilage.



## **Alternate Names**

- Rose heps, rosehip drink, LitoZin, Hyben Vital, Burr rose, camellia rose, Cherokee rose, chestnut rose, cabbage rose, Cili, coumaric acid, dog rose, French rose, gooseberry rose, hansa, hedge-pedgies, heps, hip berry, Japanese rose, Virginia rose, *Rosa canina*.



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Rosehip's anti-inflammatory action is primarily attributed to the galactolipid GOPO®. GOPO® is believed to inhibit the migration of leukocytes to the site of inflammation and reduce the production of inflammatory mediators.  The antioxidants in rosehip, such as vitamin C, help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Information on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of rosehip constituents is limited.  It's known that some of the active compounds, like vitamin C, are absorbed through the digestive tract. However, detailed pharmacokinetic data is not readily available.
- **Mode of Action:** GOPO® is thought to exert its anti-inflammatory effect by modulating the immune response, specifically by interfering with leukocyte migration and cytokine production. The exact molecular mechanisms are still being investigated.  It may also inhibit enzymes like cyclooxygenase (COX) that are involved in inflammation, though this is less well understood.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  The elimination pathways of rosehip components are not fully elucidated.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The typical dosage is 5 grams of rosehip powder per day. This can be taken as two 2.5g scoops of powder, six 835 mg capsules daily divided into twice-daily dosing or ten 500mg capsules divided into twice daily dosing. It's often mixed with food or beverages.

#### **Children:**

- There are no established standard dosage guidelines for children. Use in children should be under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

- **Elderly Patients:**  Dosage adjustments are not typically necessary, but monitoring for any adverse effects is important.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No specific dosage adjustments are established.  Caution is advised.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are established. Caution is advised.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consult with a healthcare provider about potential interactions or dose modifications if other conditions are present.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Rosehip is not typically used in acute medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its primary use is for managing chronic conditions like osteoarthritis.


### **Dosage Adjustments**
-  Currently, specific dosage adjustments based on renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms are not clearly defined.
