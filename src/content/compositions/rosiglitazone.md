## **Usage**

- Rosiglitazone is prescribed for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, often in conjunction with diet and exercise. It helps improve glycemic control by enhancing the body's sensitivity to insulin.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Thiazolidinedione, Antidiabetic Agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Rosiglitazone is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist.  It primarily works by increasing insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver, and adipose tissue, leading to improved glucose uptake and utilization.

## **Alternate Names**

- International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Rosiglitazone
- **Brand Names:** Avandia, Avandamet (rosiglitazone/metformin), Avandaryl (rosiglitazone/glimepiride).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Rosiglitazone activates PPARγ, a nuclear receptor that regulates gene expression involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. This action leads to increased insulin sensitivity, reduced hepatic glucose production, and improved lipid profiles.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Rosiglitazone is well-absorbed orally.
    - **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted mainly through the bile and feces, with a small portion eliminated in the urine.
- **Mode of Action:** By binding to PPARγ, rosiglitazone modulates the transcription of genes involved in insulin signaling, glucose transport, and adipocyte differentiation, ultimately enhancing insulin action.
- **Receptor Binding:**  PPARγ agonist.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Hepatic metabolism followed by biliary and fecal excretion, with minor renal elimination.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: 4 mg orally once daily or divided every 12 hours.
- Maintenance dose:  If the response is inadequate after 8-12 weeks, the dose may be increased to 8 mg/day, administered once daily or in two divided doses.
- Maximum dose: 8 mg/day.

#### **Children:**

- Use and dose must be determined by a doctor. Not generally recommended for pediatric use due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is typically necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is necessary for mild to moderate renal insufficiency.  Use with caution in severe renal insufficiency.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Rosiglitazone is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or ALT >2.5 times the upper limit of normal.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Rosiglitazone should be used cautiously in patients with heart failure, edema, or a history of myocardial infarction.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Rosiglitazone is specifically indicated for the management of Type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise. It is not typically used in situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments may be needed based on the patient's glycemic response,  renal function, and hepatic function.
- Monitor for signs and symptoms of heart failure (e.g., edema, dyspnea, rapid weight gain). If these occur, consider discontinuing or reducing the dose.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Upper respiratory tract infections, headache, cold-like symptoms, sinusitis, back pain,  weight gain, hyperglycemia, edema, anemia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Congestive heart failure (CHF), myocardial infarction (MI), hepatotoxicity,  bone fractures (especially in women), macular edema.

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Increased risk of heart failure, fractures, and possibly bladder cancer with long-term use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Fluid retention, weight gain,  hepatotoxicity, CHF exacerbation.

## **Contraindications**

- Heart failure (NYHA Class I-IV), active liver disease (ALT >2.5 times ULN), Type 1 diabetes, hypersensitivity to rosiglitazone, diabetic ketoacidosis, concurrent use with insulin or nitrates.

## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP450 Interactions:**  CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil, ketoconazole) may increase rosiglitazone levels; CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may decrease rosiglitazone levels.
- **Other Interactions:** Insulin, nitrates,  thiazide diuretics, some NSAIDs may increase the risk of fluid retention and CHF.
- **OTC drugs and supplements:** Some herbal supplements (e.g., St. John's wort) can affect drug metabolism.
- **Food and lifestyle factors:** Alcohol can increase the risk of hypoglycemia.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C.  Rosiglitazone may increase the risk of ovulation in premenopausal anovulatory women. Avoid use during pregnancy. Insulin is recommended to control blood glucose during pregnancy.
- **Breastfeeding:** No adequate studies in women. Rosiglitazone is likely excreted in breast milk.  The manufacturer recommends avoiding breastfeeding or discontinuing the drug. Consider pioglitazone as a potential alternative.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** PPARγ agonist, increases insulin sensitivity.
- **Side Effects:** Weight gain, edema, fluid retention, CHF, MI, fractures, hepatotoxicity.
- **Contraindications:** Heart failure, liver disease, Type 1 diabetes.
- **Drug Interactions:** CYP2C8 inhibitors/inducers, insulin, nitrates.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** Initial: 4 mg/day, max: 8mg/day.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests (ALT), signs/symptoms of CHF, HbA1c, fasting blood glucose.


## **Popular Combinations**

- Metformin: often used in combination to improve glycemic control.
- Sulfonylureas: may be used in combination but with caution due to increased risk of hypoglycemia.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Monitor liver function, signs and symptoms of heart failure,  and blood glucose levels.
- **Specific Populations**: Avoid in patients with heart failure, active liver disease, and during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Exercise caution in elderly patients and patients with renal insufficiency.
