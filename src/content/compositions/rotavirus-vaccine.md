## **Usage**

- Rotavirus vaccines are used to prevent rotavirus infection, a common cause of diarrhea and vomiting, particularly in infants and young children.
- **Pharmacological classification:**  Vaccine (Live, Attenuated, Oral)
- **Mechanism of action:** The vaccine introduces weakened strains of live rotavirus into the body, stimulating an immune response. This generates antibodies that protect against future infections with wild-type rotavirus strains.

## **Alternate Names**

- RV1 (Rotarix), RV5 (RotaTeq) are designations used for two different vaccine types.
- **Brand names:** Rotarix®, RotaTeq®

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The vaccine produces an immune response, reducing the severity and incidence of rotavirus infection.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** The vaccine is administered orally. The live attenuated viruses replicate primarily in the small intestine, stimulating local and systemic immune responses. The viruses are shed in the stool, potentially leading to indirect (herd) immunity. Elimination is mainly via fecal excretion.
- **Mode of action:** Stimulation of the immune system generates antibodies against rotavirus.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Not applicable to this vaccine.
- **Elimination pathways:** Fecal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Children:**
- **Rotarix:** Two doses: First dose at 6-14 weeks of age (ideally before 15 weeks) and the second dose at least 4 weeks after the first dose, but before 24 weeks of age.
- **RotaTeq:** Three doses: First dose at 6-12 weeks (before 13 weeks), second dose at least 4 weeks after the first dose and third dose at least 4 weeks after the second dose, but before 32 weeks of age.

#### **Adults:** Not indicated for adults.


#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** Not applicable.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Generally safe, but caution is advised in infants with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) or history of intussusception. Consult a specialist if other comorbid conditions exist.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The Rotavirus vaccine is exclusively used for routine infant immunization. It is not used in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- **Preterm infants:** Can be administered according to standard schedules.
- **Infants born to mothers who used immunosuppressive biological therapy during pregnancy:** Should not receive the vaccine.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Mild diarrhea
- Irritability
- Fussiness
- Decreased appetite
- Vomiting (infrequent)


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Intussusception (blockage in the intestine)


### **Long-Term Effects**

No long-term adverse effects have been reported.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
- Anaphylaxis (rare)

## **Contraindications**

- History of severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of rotavirus vaccine or any component of the vaccine
- Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)
- History of intussusception
- Certain rare bowel disorders (e.g., fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption, sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency)



## **Drug Interactions**

No clinically significant drug interactions have been reported.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** The vaccine is not intended for pregnant women. However, household contact with recently vaccinated infants is not contraindicated.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Breastfeeding can continue as usual.  It does not interfere with the vaccine's efficacy.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Stimulates an immune response by introducing live attenuated rotavirus strains.
- **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, irritability, fussiness, decreased appetite, vomiting (rarely). Serious but rare side effects include intussusception.
- **Contraindications:** History of allergic reaction to rotavirus vaccine, SCID, history of intussusception, specific bowel disorders.
- **Drug Interactions:**  No significant interactions.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Safe for breastfeeding infants, not indicated for pregnant women.
- **Dosage:**  Rotarix (2 doses), RotaTeq (3 doses), administered orally based on age.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Observe for symptoms of intussusception after vaccination (abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bloody stools, swollen belly, high fever).


## **Popular Combinations**

- Often administered concomitantly with other routine infant vaccines.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Standard hygiene practices should be maintained when changing diapers of recently vaccinated infants.
- **Specific Populations**: Infants with chronic gastrointestinal diseases should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
