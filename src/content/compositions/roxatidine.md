      How does Roxatidine differ from other H2 blockers?**

      **A:** While all H2 blockers share a similar mechanism of action, they
      differ in their potency, pharmacokinetic profile, and potential for drug
      interactions. Roxatidine has fewer drug interactions than cimetidine.

## **Usage**

Roxatidine is prescribed for the treatment of duodenal ulcers, benign gastric ulcers, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and gastritis. It is also used as premedication before anesthesia.  It is classified as a **H2-receptor antagonist**.

Roxatidine works by competitively blocking histamine at H2 receptors in the parietal cells of the stomach, thereby reducing basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion.

## **Alternate Names**

Roxatidine acetate hydrochloride is the chemical name. Brand names include Altat, Rotane, Zorpex, and others, which may vary depending on the region.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Roxatidine competitively inhibits the binding of histamine to H2 receptors on gastric parietal cells. This action leads to a reduction in both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, including that stimulated by gastrin and acetylcholine. Total pepsin output is also reduced in a dose-dependent manner. Roxatidine has an independent mucosal protective effect. It does not impact drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver or exhibit antiandrogenic effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Roxatidine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within 1-3 hours. Food or antacids do not affect the absorption of Roxatidine.
* **Distribution:** It enters breast milk in small amounts.
* **Metabolism:** Roxatidine is metabolized in the liver, small intestine, and serum, primarily by hydrolysis to its desacetyl metabolite.
* **Elimination:** It is primarily excreted in the urine (about 90% as roxatidine and metabolites) with an elimination half-life of approximately 6 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Roxatidine works by competitively blocking H2 receptors on parietal cells, thus preventing histamine, gastrin, and acetylcholine from stimulating acid secretion.

**Receptor Binding:** It binds specifically to the H2 receptor subtype.

**Elimination Pathways:** Roxatidine is primarily eliminated through renal excretion, with a small portion undergoing hepatic metabolism.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Duodenal Ulcer/Benign Gastric Ulcer/Reflux Esophagitis:** 150 mg at bedtime or 75 mg twice daily for 4-6 weeks. Maintenance: 75 mg at bedtime.
* **Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome:** 75 mg twice daily.
* **GERD:** 75 mg twice daily or 150 mg at bedtime for 6-8 weeks.
* **Gastritis:** 75 mg once daily in the evening.
* **Premedication before anesthesia:** 150 mg the night before surgery or 75 mg the evening before surgery and 75 mg 2 hours before induction of anesthesia.

#### **Children:**

* **Gastric Ulcer/Duodenal Ulcer/Reflux Esophagitis/Zollinger-Ellison syndrome:**  Under 30kg: 37.5 mg twice a day. Over 30 kg: 75 mg twice a day.
* **Gastritis:** Under 30 kg: 37.5 mg once a day. Over 30kg: 75 mg once a day.
* **Premedication before anesthesia:**  Under 30 kg: 37.5 mg twice (the night before surgery and 2 hours pre-op). Over 30kg: 75 mg twice (the night before surgery and 2 hours pre-op). Alternatively,  under 30 kg: 37.5 mg and over 30 kg: 75 mg once the night before surgery.

Pediatric dosing information is available mostly from resources discussing Japanese medical guidelines and should be verified for local use. It is generally not recommended for children under 14 in other regions.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment based on renal function is necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  CrCl <20 mL/min: 75 mg every 2 days; CrCl 20-50 mL/min: 75 mg at bedtime. Further adjustments may be needed for other levels of renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction may be required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient factors.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  Dosages are as described in standard use cases and should be adapted depending on patient factors and clinical considerations. Direct application of these dosages for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU and emergency use are not available in the provided sources. 

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are necessary based on renal function, hepatic function, age, and other comorbid conditions. Consider genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism.
