## **Usage**

Ruxolitinib is prescribed for the treatment of:

*   **Myelofibrosis:**  A bone marrow disorder that disrupts the body's normal production of blood cells.  Ruxolitinib helps reduce enlarged spleen size and alleviate myelofibrosis-related symptoms.  It is indicated for intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis, including primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis, and post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis.
*   **Polycythemia Vera:** A type of blood cancer that causes the bone marrow to make too many red blood cells.  It may also result in an overproduction of white blood cells and platelets. Ruxolitinib is used to treat polycythemia vera when patients have not responded adequately to or cannot tolerate hydroxyurea.
*   **Steroid-Refractory Acute and Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD):**  A complication that can occur after a stem cell or bone marrow transplant where the donated cells attack the recipient's body. Ruxolitinib is used in adults and children 12 years and older when GVHD does not respond to steroid treatment.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Janus kinase (JAK) 1 and JAK2 inhibitor.

**Mechanism of Action:** Ruxolitinib inhibits JAK1 and JAK2, which are enzymes that play a crucial role in signaling pathways involved in inflammation, immune response, and blood cell production.  By inhibiting these enzymes, Ruxolitinib helps reduce the abnormal cell growth and activity seen in myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and GVHD.


## **Alternate Names**

*   **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Ruxolitinib
*   **Brand Names:** Jakafi®, Jakavi®


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ruxolitinib primarily works by inhibiting JAK1 and JAK2, thereby reducing the activity of signaling pathways that drive the abnormal blood cell production and inflammatory processes in myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and GVHD. It effectively reduces splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) and disease-related symptoms.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:**  Orally administered Ruxolitinib is rapidly absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentrations within approximately one hour.  Food does not significantly affect its absorption.
*   **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4, with minor contributions from CYP2C9.
*   **Elimination:** Excreted mainly through urine (70%) and feces (25%). Its half-life is approximately 3 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Ruxolitinib binds to the ATP-binding sites of JAK1 and JAK2, inhibiting their kinase activity. This blocks the downstream signaling pathways that rely on these enzymes, ultimately suppressing the production of cytokines and growth factors that contribute to myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and GVHD.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Ruxolitinib inhibits JAK1 and JAK2 enzyme activity.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, with subsequent renal and fecal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   **Myelofibrosis:**  Starting dose is based on platelet count:
    *   Platelets > 200 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L: 20 mg orally twice daily.
    *   Platelets 100-200 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L: 15 mg orally twice daily.
    *   Platelets 50-<100 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L: 5 mg orally twice daily.

*   **Polycythemia Vera:** Starting dose is 10 mg orally twice daily.

*   **GVHD:** Starting dose is 5 mg orally twice daily for patients aged 12 years and older. The dose may be titrated based on response and tolerability up to a maximum of 25 mg twice daily (for myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera).

#### **Children:**

*   **GVHD (12 years and older):** 5 mg twice daily. Dosing for younger than 12 with GVHD should be based on body surface area.
*   **Myelofibrosis and Polycythemia Vera:** Use and dose must be determined by the doctor for children younger than 12.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dose adjustments are recommended, but careful monitoring is advised.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction (by about 50%) is recommended for patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction (by about 50%) is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring and dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or other relevant conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  Ruxolitinib's primary clinical uses are for myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and GVHD.  It is not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or general emergency situations (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest).

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be necessary based on patient response, tolerability, blood counts (platelets, neutrophils), and other factors like renal or hepatic impairment, drug interactions, and specific comorbid conditions.  Monitoring of complete blood counts and other relevant laboratory parameters is crucial for adjusting the dosage effectively.

## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to ruxolitinib or any of its components.
*   Pregnancy and breastfeeding.



## **Drug Interactions**

Ruxolitinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9.  Therefore, interactions can occur with:

*   **Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors:**  (e.g., ketoconazole, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice) can increase Ruxolitinib levels and require dose reduction.
*   **Strong CYP3A4 Inducers:** (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, St. John's wort) can decrease Ruxolitinib levels and may necessitate dose adjustments.
*   **Dual CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 Inhibitors:** (e.g., fluconazole) can also significantly increase Ruxolitinib levels and necessitate dose adjustments.
*   **Other Medications:**  Ruxolitinib may interact with other drugs, such as those affecting heart rate or prolonging PR interval (e.g. antiarrhythmics, beta-blockers).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

*   **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Ruxolitinib is contraindicated during pregnancy due to potential fetal risks. Effective contraception is necessary during treatment.
