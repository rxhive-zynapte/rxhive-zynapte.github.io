## **Usage**

- S-Adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) disulfate tosylate is prescribed for depression, osteoarthritis, and liver diseases (including intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and alcoholic liver disease).  It also shows potential for fibromyalgia, attention deficit hyperkinetic disorder, and Alzheimer's disease, although further research is needed.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  SAMe acts as a methyl group donor, and its therapeutic effects classify it as an antidepressant, analgesic (for osteoarthritis), and hepatoprotective agent. It is available as both a prescription drug (in some countries) and a dietary supplement.
- **Mechanism of Action:** SAMe acts as a methyl donor in various biochemical reactions, influencing several critical pathways. These include: increasing glutathione levels (important for antioxidant defense), modulating neurotransmitter synthesis (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine), and promoting phospholipid synthesis in cell membranes. In osteoarthritis, it aids in cartilage repair by boosting proteoglycan production by chondrocytes.

## **Alternate Names**

- Ademetionine disulfate tosylate
- S-Adenosyl methionine disulfate tosylate
- AdoMet disulfate tosylate
- SAMe
- SAM-e
- Ademetionine (European name)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** SAMe increases the levels of neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in the central nervous system, which helps alleviate depressive symptoms. It also promotes glutathione synthesis, offering antioxidant protection and detoxification in the liver. It enhances proteoglycan production, thereby helping to repair damaged cartilage.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** SAMe exhibits poor oral bioavailability due to instability; thus, enteric-coated formulations are preferred for oral administration.  It is also available as an injectable formulation for parenteral administration.  It is metabolized primarily in the liver through transmethylation and transsulfuration pathways. Elimination is primarily through renal and hepatic routes.
- **Mode of Action:** SAMe participates as a methyl donor in over 100 enzymatic reactions, including those involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters, phospholipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** SAMe's primary action is through methylation of various substrates rather than direct receptor binding or enzyme inhibition. It does, however, modulate neurotransmitter levels by influencing their biosynthesis.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Excreted primarily via renal and hepatic routes after metabolism in the liver.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Oral: 400-1600 mg daily, divided into two doses. The starting dose is typically 400mg/day, which can be gradually increased based on the patient's response and tolerance. The maximum daily dose is generally 1600 mg.  Injectable (IM or IV): In clinical settings, the usual dose ranges from 400 mg to 800 mg daily.

#### **Children:**

SAMe's safety and efficacy haven't been established in children, thus its use is generally avoided.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: Start with a low dose and titrate upwards as tolerated, monitoring closely for side effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Caution is advisable. Dose adjustments may be necessary based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: Careful monitoring is crucial. Dose adjustments might be needed based on liver function tests.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Close monitoring is recommended, especially in patients with bipolar disorder, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular conditions. Dose adjustments might be required.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Specific dosage recommendations for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations haven't been established for SAMe.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments should be considered for patients with renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms that affect drug metabolism. Always begin with a lower dose and titrate upwards as tolerated, monitoring for side effects.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Nausea
- Diarrhea
- Abdominal discomfort/pain

- Manic episodes (especially in bipolar disorder)
- Worsening of Parkinson's disease symptoms


### **Long-Term Effects**

Limited data on long-term effects is available. Monitoring for chronic adverse effects is recommended.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Serotonin syndrome and allergic reactions are the most significant ADRs and require urgent medical intervention.

## **Contraindications**

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Not established. While SAMe is sometimes used to treat cholestasis in pregnancy, its safety hasn't been definitively determined.  Avoid use unless explicitly prescribed by a doctor.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Safety during breastfeeding hasn't been established. SAMe does pass into breastmilk, so caution is advisable. Use alternatives if possible.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Methyl donor involved in transmethylation reactions, impacting neurotransmitter synthesis, glutathione production, phospholipid synthesis, and cartilage repair.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, headache, dizziness, insomnia, anxiety.  Rarely: allergic reaction, serotonin syndrome, mania, worsening of Parkinson's disease.
- **Contraindications:** Bipolar disorder, Parkinson's disease, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:** Antidepressants, serotonin-modulating drugs, mood stabilizers, levodopa, certain painkillers.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Safety not established.  Caution is advised.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 400-1600 mg/day orally, divided into two doses. Injectable: 400-800 mg/day.  Pediatric use not established.
