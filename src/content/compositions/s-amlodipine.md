  - q: >-
      Are there any significant drug interactions I should be aware of?**


      **A:** Yes.  CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers can alter amlodipine levels. 
      Concomitant use with other antihypertensives can potentiate the
      hypotensive effect.  Grapefruit juice can increase amlodipine levels. It
      is essential to review the patient's medication list for potential
      interactions.

      **A:** Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment, including
      cardiovascular support (fluids, vasopressors if needed), and monitoring
      vital signs and electrolyte levels.  Activated charcoal might be
      beneficial early after ingestion. Calcium gluconate administration can
      mitigate cardiovascular effects.

## **Usage**

- S-Amlodipine is primarily prescribed for **hypertension (high blood pressure)** and **chronic stable angina** (chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart). It can also be used for **vasospastic angina (Prinzmetal's angina)** and **angiographically documented coronary artery disease (CAD)** in patients without heart failure or an ejection fraction less than 40%.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, antihypertensive, antianginal agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** S-Amlodipine inhibits the influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes by blocking L-type calcium channels. This leads to vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), reducing blood pressure and improving myocardial oxygen delivery.

## **Alternate Names**

- S-(-)-Amlodipine
- Levamlodipine
- **Brand names:** Norvasc, Katerzia, Norliqva, Mylovasc, Asomex (and others, which can vary regionally).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** S-Amlodipine's primary effect is the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, leading to peripheral vasodilation and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance, thereby lowering blood pressure.  It also dilates coronary arteries, improving blood flow to the heart muscle.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Well-absorbed orally, with peak plasma concentrations reached in 6-12 hours. Food does not significantly affect absorption.  Absolute bioavailability is 64-90%.
    - **Metabolism:**  Extensively metabolized by the liver, primarily via CYP3A4.
    - **Elimination:**  Primarily eliminated through the kidneys (renal excretion), with a half-life of 30-50 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing.
- **Mode of Action:** Binds to the dihydropyridine binding site on L-type calcium channels, inhibiting calcium influx into cells. This leads to decreased vascular tone and vasodilation.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily hepatic metabolism followed by renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Hypertension:** Initial dose: 2.5-5 mg orally once daily.  May be increased to a maximum of 10 mg once daily, titrated over 7-14 days as needed based on blood pressure response. Smaller or frail individuals and geriatric patients: 2.5mg initially.
- **Angina/CAD:** 5-10 mg orally once daily, with most patients requiring 10 mg daily.

#### **Children (6-17 years):**

- **Hypertension:** 2.5-5 mg orally once daily. Doses above 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients.
- **Safety and efficacy not established in children younger than 6 years of age.**

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initial dose of 2.5 mg is recommended. Titrate cautiously as needed.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Start with a lower initial dose (e.g., 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg) and titrate slowly.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor closely, especially those with heart failure.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use/Emergency Situations:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary depending on the specific clinical scenario and patient's hemodynamic status. Continuous blood pressure monitoring is crucial.  Information on use during specific emergency situations (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest) is limited and adjustments must be made based on the patient's condition and response.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjust dose based on blood pressure response and tolerance. Consider lower initial doses and slower titration in patients with hepatic impairment. Monitor for adverse events, especially peripheral edema. No specific dosage adjustment based on creatinine clearance (renal function).

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Peripheral edema (swelling of ankles and feet)
- Headache
- Dizziness
- Flushing
- Fatigue

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Hypotension

## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin):**  May increase amlodipine levels, increasing the risk of side effects.
- **CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine):** May decrease amlodipine levels, reducing efficacy.
- **Other antihypertensives:**  Additive hypotensive effects.
- **Grapefruit juice:** Can increase amlodipine levels.
- **Simvastatin:** Can increase simvastatin levels.
- **Immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus):** May increase levels of these drugs.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C. Use only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
- **Breastfeeding:** Excreted in breast milk.  Not recommended during breastfeeding or, if it is deemed absolutely necessary to use during breastfeeding, an alternative method of infant feeding should be considered.
