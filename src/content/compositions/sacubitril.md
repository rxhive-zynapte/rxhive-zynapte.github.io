Sacubitril is only available in combination with valsartan. This combined drug is known as sacubitril/valsartan.  Therefore, the information provided below pertains to the combined drug sacubitril/valsartan.

## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Sacubitril/valsartan is prescribed for chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).  It is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic HFrEF (NYHA Class II-IV).  It is usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies, replacing ACE inhibitors or ARBs.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI). Sacubitril is a neprilysin inhibitor and valsartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Sacubitril/valsartan has a dual mechanism: Sacubitril inhibits neprilysin, a neutral endopeptidase that degrades vasoactive peptides including natriuretic peptides. Valsartan blocks the angiotensin II type-1 receptor, preventing vasoconstriction and aldosterone release. The combined effect leads to increased levels of natriuretic peptides, promoting vasodilation, natriuresis, and diuresis, thereby reducing cardiac workload and improving hemodynamics in heart failure.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Sacubitril/valsartan
- **Brand Names:** Entresto, Vymada


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Sacubitril increases levels of vasoactive peptides like natriuretic peptides, resulting in vasodilation, natriuresis, and diuresis. Valsartan blocks the effects of angiotensin II, leading to vasodilation and reduced aldosterone secretion.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Both sacubitril and valsartan are orally administered. Sacubitril is rapidly metabolised to the active metabolite LBQ657.  Valsartan is also metabolized, but to a lesser extent. Both LBQ657 and valsartan are primarily eliminated through biliary excretion, with a smaller portion undergoing renal excretion.  They have a half-life of approximately 12 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Sacubitril inhibits neprilysin, preventing the breakdown of natriuretic peptides. Valsartan blocks the AT1 receptor, preventing angiotensin II from binding and exerting its effects.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Sacubitril inhibits neprilysin. Valsartan blocks AT1 receptors.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily biliary excretion; some renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Starting Dose:** 49 mg sacubitril/51 mg valsartan twice daily.
- **Target Maintenance Dose:** 97 mg sacubitril/103 mg valsartan twice daily.
- **Titration:** Double the dose every 2-4 weeks as tolerated, aiming for the target maintenance dose.
- **Patients not currently taking an ACE inhibitor or an ARB or taking low doses:**  Starting dose of 24 mg/26 mg twice daily, doubling every 3–4 weeks as tolerated, up to the target maintenance dose.
- **Patients with SBP ≥100 to 110 mmHg:** A starting dose of 24 mg/26 mg twice daily should be considered.

#### **Children (1 year and older):**  Dosing based on body weight. See detailed dosing information in sources. 

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lowest dose and titrate cautiously. Close monitoring of renal function and blood pressure is important.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2):** Start at half the usual recommended starting dose.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction (Child-Pugh B):** Start at half the usual recommended starting dose. Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) is a contraindication.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is recommended.  Dose adjustments may be necessary based on individual patient characteristics and response to therapy.
