## **Usage**

- Safinamide is prescribed as an add-on treatment to levodopa/carbidopa for Parkinson's disease patients experiencing "off" episodes (periods when the medication's effects wear off).  It is indicated for patients with mid- to late-stage Parkinson's disease experiencing motor fluctuations. It has shown efficacy in improving motor control and reducing "off" time in these patients. It is not indicated as monotherapy.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor, also possessing non-dopaminergic properties like glutamate release inhibition.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Safinamide primarily works by reversibly inhibiting MAO-B, an enzyme that breaks down dopamine in the brain. This action increases dopamine levels, which helps to control motor symptoms. Additionally, safinamide modulates glutamate release through its effects on sodium and calcium channels, further contributing to its therapeutic benefits.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Safinamide
- **Brand Names:** Xadago, Pronstryv


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Safinamide primarily and reversibly inhibits MAO-B, leading to increased dopamine availability in the brain. It also blocks voltage-gated sodium channels and reduces abnormal glutamate release, contributing to motor symptom control.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) reached within 2-4 hours under fasting conditions. Food intake slightly delays Tmax but does not affect overall absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized primarily via N-dealkylation, forming inactive metabolites.  Does not significantly induce or inhibit major CYP450 enzymes (CYP2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A3/5) at clinically relevant concentrations.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through the kidneys (approximately 76%), mainly as inactive metabolites. Only a small percentage (approximately 5%) is excreted unchanged in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 20-26 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing.
- **Mode of Action:** Inhibits MAO-B enzyme, thus increasing dopamine concentration in the synaptic cleft. Also blocks sodium and calcium channels reducing glutamate release.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** MAO-B enzyme inhibition, modulation of sodium and calcium channels influencing glutamate release.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Initial Dose:** 50 mg orally once daily.
- **Maintenance Dose:** After two weeks, the dose may be increased to 100 mg orally once daily, based on individual patient response and tolerability. Doses above 100 mg have not demonstrated additional benefit and increase the risk of adverse reactions.


#### **Children:**

- The safety and efficacy of safinamide have not been established in children under 18 years of age.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is typically necessary; however, clinical experience in patients older than 75 is limited.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
    - Mild impairment: No dose adjustment required.
    - Moderate impairment (Child-Pugh B): Maximum dose is 50 mg once daily.
    - Severe impairment (Child-Pugh C): Contraindicated.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution and careful monitoring are advised in patients with cardiovascular disease, psychosis, or a history of impulse control disorders.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Safinamide is specifically indicated as add-on therapy to levodopa/carbidopa for Parkinson's disease with motor fluctuations. It is not indicated for use in intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, intensive care, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustment may be necessary in moderate hepatic impairment or when specific drug interactions are present.




## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Dyskinesia (involuntary movements), falls, nausea, insomnia, dizziness (especially orthostatic hypotension), anxiety, cough, heartburn/indigestion, blurred vision, headache, nervousness, palpitations, and tachycardia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Hallucinations, psychotic behavior, impulse control disorders (pathological gambling, increased libido, compulsive spending), serotonin syndrome (when combined with certain medications), withdrawal-emergent hyperpyrexia and confusion (upon abrupt discontinuation), retinal disorders (in patients with pre-existing conditions), and angioedema.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Potential long-term side effects are not fully established.  Regular monitoring for vision changes and impulse control disorders is recommended.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Angioedema, serotonin syndrome, hypertensive crisis (with MAOIs), and withdrawal syndrome (hyperpyrexia and confusion) require immediate medical intervention.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to safinamide.
- Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).
- Concomitant use of MAO inhibitors (including linezolid), pethidine, dextromethorphan,  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), tetracyclic antidepressants, triazolopyridine antidepressants, cyclobenzaprine, St. John's wort, methylphenidate, amphetamines, and related derivatives.
- Patients with albinism, retinal degeneration, uveitis, inherited retinopathy, or severe progressive diabetic retinopathy.


## **Drug Interactions**

- **MAOIs:** Concurrent use is contraindicated due to the risk of hypertensive crisis. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuing safinamide and starting MAOIs.
- **Opioids (e.g., pethidine, tramadol, meperidine):** Concomitant use is contraindicated due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.
- **Serotonergic Drugs (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs):** Concurrent use is contraindicated due to the risk of serotonin syndrome. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuing these medications and initiating safinamide. Monitor for serotonin syndrome if co-administration with SSRIs is necessary.
- **Dextromethorphan:** Concurrent use is contraindicated due to the risk of psychosis and bizarre behavior.
- **Isoniazid:** Monitor for hypertension and tyramine reaction due to isoniazid's MAO inhibiting activity.
- **Tyramine-Containing Foods:** Patients should avoid foods high in tyramine (e.g., aged cheese, pickled herring) due to the risk of hypertensive crisis, especially at higher doses of safinamide.
- **CYP450 Substrates:** No clinically significant interactions with CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 substrates have been observed.
- **BCRP Substrates (e.g., rosuvastatin, pravastatin, ciprofloxacin):** Monitor for potential increased exposure to these substrates.
- **OCT1 Substrates (e.g., metformin, aciclovir):** Monitor for potential increased exposure to these substrates.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (US FDA).  Not recommended during pregnancy due to observed teratogenicity in animal studies.  Developmental toxicity was observed at clinically relevant doses and at even lower doses when co-administered with levodopa/carbidopa. 
- **Breastfeeding:**  Safinamide is expected to be present in breast milk. It is not recommended during breastfeeding due to the risk of potential adverse effects on the nursing infant, including liver toxicity observed in animal studies.



## **Drug Profile Summary**
