## **Usage**

Salicylic acid is primarily used topically for its keratolytic, comedolytic, and anti-inflammatory properties. It is prescribed for various dermatological conditions, including:

*   **Acne vulgaris:** Salicylic acid helps to unclog pores and reduce inflammation associated with acne.
*   **Warts (common, plantar, flat):** It softens and breaks down the wart tissue, allowing it to be shed gradually.
*   **Corns and calluses:** Salicylic acid softens the thick, hardened skin, making it easier to remove.
*   **Psoriasis:** It helps to reduce scaling and inflammation in psoriatic plaques.
*   **Dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis:** It exfoliates the scalp, reducing scaling and itching.
*   **Keratosis pilaris:**  Salicylic acid helps to smooth rough, bumpy skin.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Keratolytic, comedolytic, anti-inflammatory agent.

**Mechanism of Action:** Salicylic acid promotes the shedding of dead skin cells by breaking down the bonds between them. This keratolytic action helps to unclog pores, preventing the formation of comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) and reducing inflammation in acne. It also softens and destroys the stratum corneum in conditions like warts, corns, and calluses, facilitating their removal.

## **Alternate Names**

*   **Beta-hydroxy acid (BHA)**
*   **2-Hydroxybenzoic acid**

**Brand Names:** Numerous brand names exist depending on the formulation and country. Examples include Keralyt, Compound W, Stridex, Clearasil, and many others.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Salicylic acid's primary effect is keratolytic, achieved by disrupting intercellular cohesion in the stratum corneum, leading to desquamation. It also possesses anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting cyclooxygenase activity and reducing prostaglandin synthesis.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Topical salicylic acid is absorbed percutaneously, with the extent of absorption varying depending on factors like concentration, vehicle, and application site.  Metabolism primarily occurs in the liver, with conjugation to form salicyluric acid and glucuronide metabolites. Elimination is mainly through renal excretion.

**Mode of Action:** Salicylic acid increases endogenous hydration of the stratum corneum, causing it to swell, soften, and desquamate. This exfoliating action helps to remove dead skin cells, unclog pores, and reduce inflammation.


**Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of metabolites (salicyluric acid and glucuronides).



## **Dosage**

Salicylic acid dosage varies depending on the condition being treated, the formulation (cream, gel, lotion, solution, patch, shampoo, etc.), and the concentration of salicylic acid in the product.


### **Standard Dosage**  

#### **Adults:** Topical application as directed, typically once or twice daily. Concentrations range from 0.5% to 40% depending on the indication. Lower concentrations (0.5%-2%) are used for acne, while higher concentrations (5%-40%) are employed for warts, corns, and calluses.

#### **Children:** Topical application as directed, typically once or twice daily. Use of salicylic acid is generally not recommended for children younger than 2 years of age. For children older than 2 years, lower concentrations (0.5%-5%) are typically used, and the application area and duration of use should be limited.

#### **Special Cases:**  

*   **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are generally needed, but caution is advised in patients with age-related blood vessel disease.

*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution, as systemic absorption can occur, particularly with higher concentrations or large application areas. Dosage adjustment may be necessary in severe renal impairment.

*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution, as salicylic acid is metabolized in the liver. Dosage adjustment may be necessary in severe hepatic impairment.

*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Patients with diabetes or impaired circulation should use higher concentrations of salicylic acid with caution. Avoid use on moles, birthmarks, or unusual warts.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  

Salicylic acid is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use. It is primarily used as a topical agent for dermatological conditions. In emergency situations requiring pain or fever reduction, oral or rectal formulations of other salicylates (like aspirin) may be used.


### **Dosage Adjustments**  

Dosage adjustments may be required for patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction. Lower concentrations and smaller application areas should be considered. Consult a healthcare professional for guidance.



## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects**  

*   Mild skin irritation (burning, stinging, redness, peeling)
*   Dryness
*   Itching



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**  

*   Salicylate toxicity (nausea, vomiting, dizziness, hearing loss, tinnitus, confusion, hyperpnea, diarrhea) - more likely in young children or patients with renal/hepatic impairment.
*   Severe allergic reactions (hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, or tongue)



### **Long-Term Effects**  

Long-term use can potentially lead to skin thinning or discoloration.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions and salicylate toxicity require immediate medical attention.





## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to salicylic acid or any other ingredient in the formulation.
*   Use on moles, birthmarks, or unusual warts (especially with hair growth).
*   Use on open wounds or broken skin.
*   Use in children under 2 years of age (for most formulations).


## **Drug Interactions**

Topical salicylic acid may interact with other topical medications, especially those containing retinoids or benzoyl peroxide, potentially causing increased irritation.  Concomitant use of other keratolytic agents should be avoided.  Systemic absorption of salicylic acid can potentially interact with oral medications like anticoagulants or other NSAIDs, although the risk is generally low with topical use. It's crucial to inform your healthcare provider of all other medications, OTC drugs, and supplements you are using.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Topical salicylic acid is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding in low concentrations (2% or less) when applied to small areas. However, it's best to consult with a healthcare professional before using salicylic acid during pregnancy or breastfeeding. High concentrations or oral salicylates are not recommended during pregnancy.

## **Drug Profile Summary**
