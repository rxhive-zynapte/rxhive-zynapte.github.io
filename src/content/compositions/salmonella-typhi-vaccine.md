## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Salmonella Typhi vaccine is prescribed for active immunization against typhoid fever caused by *Salmonella enterica* serovar Typhi (formerly *Salmonella typhi*).  It is recommended for individuals traveling to typhoid-endemic areas, those with intimate exposure to a documented *S. Typhi* carrier, and laboratory personnel frequently handling *S. Typhi*.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Vaccine.
- **Mechanism of Action:** This vaccine stimulates an immune response against the Vi capsular polysaccharide of *Salmonella* Typhi. The Vi antigen is a virulence factor of *S. Typhi*.  By eliciting an immune response, the vaccine primes the body to fight against *S. Typhi* infection upon exposure.


## **Alternate Names**

- Typhoid Vi Polysaccharide Vaccine (ViCPS).
- Brand Names: Typhim Vi.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** The vaccine generates a predominantly humoral immune response, stimulating the production of specific antibodies against the *S. Typhi* Vi polysaccharide. These antibodies mediate opsonization and complement activation, leading to bacterial clearance.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** The vaccine is administered intramuscularly. After injection, the Vi polysaccharide is slowly absorbed from the injection site. Data on its metabolism and elimination are limited.
- **Mode of Action:** The vaccine's mode of action centers on its interaction with B cells and T-helper cells within the immune system.  The Vi polysaccharide, being a T-independent antigen, primarily activates B cells directly, leading to antibody production without the need for T-helper cell assistance. This immune response primarily targets the Vi capsular polysaccharide, inhibiting bacterial adherence and enhancing phagocytosis.
- **Elimination pathways:** Information on the elimination pathways is limited.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** A single 0.5 mL dose intramuscularly (IM) administered in the deltoid muscle.

#### **Children (≥2 years of age):**  A single 0.5 mL dose intramuscularly (IM) administered in the deltoid or the vastus lateralis muscle.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** The standard adult dosage is generally appropriate.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are not typically necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustments are not typically necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific dosage adjustments are required, but clinical judgment based on the patient's overall condition is advised.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The vaccine is not indicated for use in specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It is used for pre-exposure prophylaxis against typhoid.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific dosage adjustments are typically necessary based on renal or hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Local reactions at the injection site (pain, redness, swelling).
- Headache.
- Fever.
- Malaise.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).

### **Long-Term Effects**

No significant long-term adverse effects have been reported.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs are rare but may include severe allergic reactions.


## **Contraindications**
