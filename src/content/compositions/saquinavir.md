## **Usage**

- Saquinavir is prescribed for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults. It's always used in combination with ritonavir and other antiretroviral agents.  It is not a cure for HIV but helps manage the disease.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antiretroviral, Protease Inhibitor.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Saquinavir inhibits HIV protease, an enzyme crucial for viral replication. By blocking this enzyme, Saquinavir prevents the cleavage of viral polyproteins, thus disrupting the formation of mature infectious viral particles.

## **Alternate Names**

- **Invirase** (hard-gel capsule and tablet formulations)
- **Fortovase** (soft-gel capsule formulation, no longer marketed)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Saquinavir prevents the maturation of new HIV virions by blocking HIV protease. This leads to a decrease in the viral load in the patient's blood and helps to improve immune function.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Saquinavir exhibits poor oral bioavailability when administered alone. Ritonavir, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, is co-administered to significantly boost saquinavir plasma concentrations by inhibiting its metabolism.  Saquinavir is primarily metabolized by the liver via the CYP3A4 enzyme system. It is mainly excreted in feces, with minimal renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** Saquinavir competitively binds to the active site of HIV protease, preventing the enzyme from cleaving viral polyprotein precursors necessary for the formation of infectious viral particles.  This interference in the viral life cycle reduces viral load and supports immune system recovery.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism through CYP3A4 enzymes, followed by fecal excretion.  Minimal renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: Saquinavir 500 mg with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily for the first 7 days.
- Standard dose: Saquinavir 1000 mg with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily taken with food.
- Administration: Oral, with food (within 2 hours after a full meal).
- Maximum dosage: Not specifically defined, adjustments are made based on patient response and tolerability.

#### **Children:**

- Saquinavir is not approved for use in children younger than 16 years of age.  Dosing must be determined by a doctor for children over 16.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to potential age-related decrease in hepatic, renal, or cardiac function. Dose adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No initial dose adjustment is necessary, but caution should be exercised in severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution in moderate to severe hepatic insufficiency. Dosage modifications may be required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider adjustments for other medical conditions, especially cardiovascular disease and diabetes, due to potential drug interactions and side effects.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Saquinavir is not specifically indicated for use in scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  It is used as part of a long-term HIV treatment strategy.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage modifications may be necessary based on individual patient factors such as renal or hepatic dysfunction, drug interactions, and other comorbidities. Close monitoring of patient response and potential side effects is crucial.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Diarrhea
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Abdominal pain/discomfort
- Tiredness
- Changes in body fat distribution (lipodystrophy)
- Headache
- Altered taste


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Pancreatitis
- Liver toxicity (hepatotoxicity)
- Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome)
- Cardiac arrhythmias (QT prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, heart block)
- Bleeding disorders (in patients with hemophilia)


### **Long-Term Effects**

- Lipodystrophy
- Metabolic abnormalities (dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, diabetes)
- Increased risk of cardiovascular disease


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis)
- Severe hepatotoxicity
- QT prolongation leading to life-threatening arrhythmias


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to saquinavir or any component of the formulation
- Severe hepatic impairment
- Complete atrioventricular block without a pacemaker
- Congenital long QT syndrome
- Coadministration with drugs that significantly inhibit CYP3A4 and prolong the QT interval (e.g., rifampin, astemizole, terfenadine, pimozide, midazolam, triazolam)
- Coadministration with other drugs that may cause serious or life-threatening reactions due to increased saquinavir plasma levels


## **Drug Interactions**

Saquinavir is a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A4.  Numerous drug interactions are possible. Consult a comprehensive drug interaction database before co-prescribing any medication with saquinavir/ritonavir.  Some key interactions include:

- **CYP3A4 inhibitors:** Increase saquinavir levels (e.g., ketoconazole, clarithromycin)
- **CYP3A4 inducers:** Decrease saquinavir levels (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort)
- **Drugs that prolong the QT interval:** Increase the risk of arrhythmias (e.g., amiodarone, quinidine)
- **HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins):** Increase the risk of statin-related myopathy (e.g., lovastatin, simvastatin)
- **Hormonal contraceptives:** Saquinavir may reduce their efficacy


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Category B. Saquinavir should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  Saquinavir exposures are reduced during pregnancy, but dose adjustments are not recommended.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Saquinavir is excreted in rat milk. It's unknown if it's present in human milk. Due to potential HIV transmission and potential adverse effects on the infant, breastfeeding is not recommended for HIV-positive women.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** HIV protease inhibitor
- **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, nausea, lipodystrophy, QT prolongation
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe hepatic impairment, certain drug interactions
- **Drug Interactions:** Numerous; consult a drug interaction database
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Not recommended
- **Dosage:** Adults: 1000 mg with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily with food.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** HIV viral load, CD4 cell count, liver function tests, lipid profile, electrocardiogram (ECG), blood glucose



## **Popular Combinations**

Saquinavir is always used in combination with ritonavir and other antiretroviral agents.  Specific combinations are determined based on individual patient characteristics and resistance patterns.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess liver and renal function, monitor for cardiac arrhythmias, screen for drug interactions, and educate patients about the importance of adherence.
- **Specific Populations:**  Pregnancy (avoid if possible), breastfeeding (contraindicated).
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Encourage healthy diet and exercise to mitigate metabolic side effects.
