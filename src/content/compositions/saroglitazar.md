## **Usage**

- Saroglitazar is prescribed for the treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus not adequately controlled by statin therapy.  It is also used to treat non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-cirrhotic non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Dual PPAR-alpha/gamma agonist (anti-diabetic, lipid-lowering agent).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Saroglitazar activates both PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma receptors. PPAR-alpha activation increases fatty acid oxidation, reducing triglycerides and other harmful lipids. PPAR-gamma activation improves insulin sensitivity in muscle and fat tissues, lowering blood glucose levels.

## **Alternate Names**

- Saroglitazar Magnesium
- **Brand Names:** Lipaglyn

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Saroglitazar exerts its therapeutic effects through the activation of PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma receptors.  This dual activation leads to a reduction in triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, fasting plasma glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), while increasing HDL cholesterol.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Saroglitazar exhibits dose-proportional pharmacokinetics with a Cmax achieved shortly after oral administration. The presence of food does not significantly affect absorption.
    - **Metabolism:**  In vitro studies suggest minimal inhibition or induction of CYP450 enzymes.
    - **Elimination:**  Elimination pathways are not fully characterized, but likely involve both hepatic and renal routes.
- **Mode of Action:**  Saroglitazar binds to and activates PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma receptors, which are nuclear receptors involved in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Saroglitazar is a PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma agonist.  No significant interaction with CYP450 enzymes has been observed.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 4 mg once daily, taken orally with a meal.

#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy not established in children under 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to potential comorbidity and concomitant medications.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Patients with cardiovascular disease or episodic congestive heart failure should be monitored closely for fluid retention and signs of congestive heart failure.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Saroglitazar is not indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its primary indication is for chronic management of diabetic dyslipidemia.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Often used in combination with statins for enhanced lipid control.
- Metformin can be added for additional glycemic control (monitor for hypoglycemia).

## **Precautions**

- Monitor liver function, kidney function, and cardiovascular status.
- Assess for fluid retention.
- Caution in patients with liver or kidney disease, stomach ulcers, or abdominal pain.
- Avoid alcohol consumption.
- Exercise caution when driving due to potential dizziness.
