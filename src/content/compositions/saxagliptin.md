## **Usage**

- Saxagliptin is prescribed as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It is used in multiple clinical settings, including as monotherapy, dual therapy, or triple therapy.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, Antihyperglycemic agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Saxagliptin works by inhibiting the enzyme DPP-4. This enzyme breaks down incretins, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP).  By preventing the breakdown of these incretins, saxagliptin increases their levels. Incretins stimulate insulin release in a glucose-dependent manner and decrease glucagon secretion, thereby lowering blood glucose levels.

## **Alternate Names**

- International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Saxagliptin
- **Brand Names:** Onglyza, Kombiglyze XR (in combination with metformin)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Saxagliptin increases levels of active incretins GLP-1 and GIP, leading to increased insulin secretion and decreased glucagon secretion.  These effects are glucose-dependent, minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Saxagliptin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 2 hours. Food does not affect the overall exposure to saxagliptin.
    - **Metabolism:** Saxagliptin is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5) enzymes to its major active metabolite, 5-hydroxy saxagliptin.  This metabolite has similar pharmacological activity.
    - **Elimination:** Saxagliptin and its metabolites are eliminated via both renal and hepatic pathways.  The elimination half-life of saxagliptin is approximately 2.5 hours, and the half-life of the active metabolite is about 3.1 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Saxagliptin exerts its effect by binding to and inhibiting the DPP-4 enzyme.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Enzyme inhibition (DPP-4).
- **Elimination pathways:** Renal and hepatic excretion, metabolism by CYP3A4/5 enzymes.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 2.5 mg or 5 mg orally once daily, regardless of meals.
- The maximum recommended dose is 5 mg once daily.

#### **Children:**

- The safety and efficacy of saxagliptin have not been established in pediatric patients. Use is not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initial and maintenance dosing should be conservative due to potential age-related decline in renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  
    - Mild renal impairment (CrCl > 50 mL/min): No dosage adjustment necessary.
    - Moderate or severe renal impairment (CrCl ≤ 50 mL/min): 2.5 mg orally once daily.
    - End-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis: Not recommended.  If use is unavoidable, administer 2.5 mg after hemodialysis.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** 
    - Mild or moderate hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment necessary, but use with caution in moderate impairment.
    - Severe hepatic impairment: Not recommended.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  For patients with a history of pancreatitis or heart failure, saxagliptin should be used with caution. If used concomitantly with a sulfonylurea or insulin, a lower dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Saxagliptin's use is limited to glycemic management in type 2 diabetes mellitus.  It is not indicated for:

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations**

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose reduction is necessary in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (CrCl ≤ 50 mL/min).
- When co-administered with strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir), the dose should be reduced to 2.5 mg once daily.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Upper respiratory tract infection
- Nasopharyngitis
- Headache
- Urinary tract infection

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Pancreatitis

- Bullous pemphigoid
-  Heart failure (especially in patients with pre-existing heart or kidney disease)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- The long-term safety profile of saxagliptin is still being evaluated.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- **CYP3A4/5 inducers:** May decrease saxagliptin concentrations.
- **Sulfonylureas, Insulin:** Increased risk of hypoglycemia. Dosage adjustments of these agents may be required.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Category B.  Saxagliptin should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
