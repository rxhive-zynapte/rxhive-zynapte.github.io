## **Usage**

Selenium dioxide is not typically used as a medicine. It's an industrial chemical used in various applications like:

* Oxidizing agent in organic synthesis.
* Colorant in glass manufacturing.
* Toner in photographic development.

Selenium itself, as selenious acid, is used in total parenteral nutrition (TPN) to prevent selenium deficiency.  It's an essential trace mineral important for various bodily functions like thyroid hormone metabolism, antioxidant defense, and immune function. It is often prescribed to treat selenium deficiency. Selenium is classified as a trace mineral or dietary supplement. 

The mechanism of action of selenium involves its incorporation into selenoproteins, which exert various biological effects.

## **Alternate Names**

* Selenium(IV) oxide
* Selenious anhydride
* Dioxyde de Sélénium


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Selenium exerts its effects primarily through its incorporation into selenoproteins. These proteins have diverse roles in the body, including:

* **Antioxidant activity:** Glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductases containing selenium act as antioxidants, protecting cells from oxidative stress.
* **Thyroid hormone metabolism:** Iodothyronine deiodinases, selenoproteins, are essential for converting thyroxine (T4) to the active thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine (T3).
* **Immune function:** Selenium influences immune responses by affecting the activity of various immune cells.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Selenium is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, with organic forms like selenomethionine being more bioavailable than inorganic forms like selenite.
* **Metabolism:** Selenium undergoes various metabolic transformations, including methylation and incorporation into selenoproteins.
* **Elimination:** Selenium is primarily excreted in the urine, with smaller amounts eliminated in feces and breath.

**Mode of action:** At the cellular level, selenium functions as a component of the amino acid selenocysteine, which is incorporated into selenoproteins. Selenocysteine resembles cysteine, but it contains selenium in place of sulfur. This unique amino acid is essential for the catalytic activity of many selenoproteins.

**Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**  Selenium's mode of action is primarily related to its role as a catalytic center in selenoproteins rather than through direct receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation.

**Elimination pathways:** Selenium is primarily excreted in the urine as various metabolites. Some selenium is also eliminated in feces and expired air.


## **Dosage**


The recommended daily allowance (RDA) of selenium varies depending on age, gender, and life stage. The dosage should be individualized.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** The RDA for adults is 55 mcg/day.  Supplementation can range between 100-200 mcg/day. The upper tolerable intake level is 400 mcg/day.

#### **Children:** Selenium requirements for children vary with age. Consult pediatric guidelines for specific recommendations.

#### **Special Cases:** Dosage should be adjusted for specific populations:

* **Elderly Patients:** The RDA for elderly individuals is the same as for adults (55 mcg/day).
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be necessary based on renal function.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose modifications should be considered in patients with liver disease.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Certain comorbid conditions may require individualized dosing.


The following section applies to Selenium as selenious acid for use in TPN, not selenium dioxide:

### **Clinical Use Cases**  Selenium is primarily given through TPN in clinical settings where oral or enteral nutrition isn't feasible, like:

* **Intubation**
* **Surgical Procedures**
* **Mechanical Ventilation**
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**

For TPN, the standard dose in adults is 20-40 mcg/day.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

* **Renal/hepatic dysfunction:** Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
Selenium toxicity can cause:
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Fatigue
* Hair loss
* Nail changes

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
* Severe gastrointestinal symptoms
* Neurological abnormalities (e.g., numbness, tremors)
* Respiratory distress



### **Long-Term Effects**
Chronic selenium toxicity, known as selenosis, can lead to:
* Garlic breath odor
* Hair and nail loss
* Brittle nails
* Gastrointestinal disturbances
* Skin rashes
* Nervous system effects



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Severe selenium toxicity can result in renal failure, cardiac dysfunction, and even death.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to selenium

## **Drug Interactions**
* Medications that decrease the immune system (Immunosuppressants)
* Chemotherapeutic agents

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The RDA for selenium during pregnancy is 60 mcg/day, and 70 mcg/day during breastfeeding. Higher doses should be avoided.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Antioxidant, thyroid hormone metabolism support, immune function modulation.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, fatigue, hair loss, nail changes; serious effects are rare.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:** Immunosuppressants.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** RDA is increased; avoid high doses.
* **Dosage:** RDA: Adults - 55 mcg/day; children - varies with age. TPN: 20-40 mcg/day in adults.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Plasma selenium levels.

## **Popular Combinations**

Not applicable to selenium dioxide.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Monitor plasma selenium levels.
* **Specific Populations:** Pregnant/breastfeeding women: Adhere to RDA.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Encourage a balanced diet with selenium-rich foods.
