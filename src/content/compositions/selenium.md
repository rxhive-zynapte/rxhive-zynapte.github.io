## **Usage**

- Selenium is primarily used as a nutritional supplement to prevent or treat selenium deficiency. It plays a crucial role in various physiological processes. Selenium is indicated for Keshan disease, a type of cardiomyopathy, and is being researched for potential benefits in other health conditions.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Nutritional supplement, antioxidant.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Selenium is incorporated into selenoproteins, which exert antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and thyroid hormone-modulating effects.


## **Alternate Names**

-  No alternate generic names. The term "selenium" refers to the element itself.

-  **Brand Names:** Selepen (and various other brand names for selenium-containing supplements).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Selenium is an essential component of selenoproteins, including glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductases, which protect cells from oxidative damage.  It is involved in thyroid hormone metabolism, immune function, and DNA synthesis.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Selenium is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, with selenomethionine having higher bioavailability than selenite.  It is distributed throughout the body, with higher concentrations in the liver, kidneys, and skeletal muscle. Selenium is excreted primarily in urine.


- **Mode of Action:** Selenium acts as an antioxidant by catalyzing the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and other reactive oxygen species, preventing cellular damage. It also modulates the activity of deiodinases, enzymes involved in thyroid hormone activation and deactivation.

- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Selenium's primary mechanism is integration into selenoproteins, which act as enzymes (e.g., glutathione peroxidases). It does not directly bind to receptors or modulate neurotransmitters.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion, with some elimination through the lungs and feces at higher doses. Metabolism occurs via methylation and other pathways.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): 55 mcg/day.
- Therapeutic doses: 100-200 mcg/day, up to 400 mcg/day.
- Administration: Oral, preferably with meals.

#### **Children:**

- RDA varies by age (see sources). Pediatric dosing should be determined based on age and nutritional needs.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Standard adult dose. Monitor for toxicity.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider underlying conditions and potential drug interactions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**
The use of selenium for specific clinical conditions, such as those listed below, is still being researched.  Dosage varies based on the trial.

- **Intubation:** Specific guidelines not established.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Specific guidelines not established.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Specific guidelines not established.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Some research suggests that selenium supplementation may be beneficial, but optimal dosing and method of administration are not standardized.
- **Emergency Situations:**  No specific emergency uses are established.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**  Individualized dosing based on patient factors like renal/hepatic function, selenium status, and coexisting medical conditions is necessary.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Diarrhea
- Hair Loss
- Fatigue
- Garlic-like breath odor

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
- Selenosis (selenium toxicity): Symptoms can include gastrointestinal distress, neurological symptoms, and, in severe cases, organ failure.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
- Severe selenosis, allergic reactions.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to selenium.
- History of skin cancer (long-term use may increase the risk of recurrence).



## **Drug Interactions**

- Eltrombopag


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Pregnancy Safety Category: A (when taken in recommended amounts).  Doses above the RDA might be harmful.  
-  Adequate selenium intake is important for fetal development and maternal health during pregnancy. Higher doses should be avoided. 
- Selenium is excreted in breast milk.  Lactating individuals can take recommended daily amounts of selenium.




## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Antioxidant, incorporated into selenoproteins.
