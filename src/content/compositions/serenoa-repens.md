## **Usage**

- Serenoa repens, commonly known as saw palmetto, is primarily used to alleviate lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  BPH is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland that can cause difficulties with urination.  It may also be used to prevent complications from prostate surgery.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Phytotherapeutic agent, traditionally classified as a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor.  
- **Mechanism of Action:**  The primary mechanism is believed to be inhibition of 5-alpha-reductase, the enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT).  DHT is thought to play a significant role in prostate enlargement.  Additional proposed mechanisms include anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects on prostate cells, and potential alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocking activity.

## **Alternate Names**
- *Serenoa serrulata*, Sabal serrulata, American dwarf palm tree, cabbage palm, dwarf palm.
- **Brand Names:** Permixon, Prostamol Uno, and others, although formulations and extract types may vary between brands.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Saw palmetto primarily affects the prostate gland by inhibiting 5-alpha-reductase, thus reducing DHT levels and potentially slowing prostate growth.  It may also have anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects within the prostate.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** The pharmacokinetics of saw palmetto are not fully understood.  Liposterolic extracts, the most commonly studied form, are thought to be absorbed orally, although bioavailability data is limited.  Metabolism and elimination pathways are not well-characterized, but both hepatic and renal routes are likely involved.
- **Mode of Action:**  Primarily acts by inhibiting type I and II 5-alpha-reductase isoenzymes. The most commonly used extracts are the hexane extract (Permixon), and ethanolic extracts.  These extracts have shown in multiple systematic reviews potential benefits with fewer adverse events.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Inhibits 5-alpha-reductase, potentially blocking alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, and may exert anti-inflammatory effects through various pathways.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Not fully elucidated but likely involves both hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The typical dosage for BPH is 320 mg/day of a liposterolic extract standardized to 85-95% fatty acids and sterols. This can be administered once daily or in two divided doses of 160 mg.  

#### **Children:**

-  Saw palmetto is not recommended for use in children.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustments are generally not necessary but should be considered on a case-by-case basis depending on renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution is advised.  Dose adjustments may be needed depending on the degree of impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised.  Dose adjustments may be needed depending on the degree of impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with diabetes, bleeding disorders, or those taking anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Serenoa repens is not typically used in acute clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Its use is primarily focused on long-term management of BPH symptoms.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose modifications should be considered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  Drug interactions with anticoagulants and antiplatelet medications necessitate careful monitoring and possible dose adjustments.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain).
- Headache, dizziness.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Hepatic dysfunction (rare).
- Pancreatitis (rare).


### **Long-Term Effects**
- No significant long-term side effects have been consistently reported, but long-term studies are limited.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Hypersensitivity reactions (rare).
- Increased bleeding risk (especially with concomitant anticoagulant use).



## **Contraindications**

- Known hypersensitivity to saw palmetto.
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding (due to potential hormonal effects).
- Use with caution in women of childbearing age.


## **Drug Interactions**

- **Anticoagulants/Antiplatelet drugs:** May increase bleeding risk.
- **Estrogens/Oral Contraceptives:** May decrease the effectiveness of these medications.
- **5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (e.g., finasteride):**  Concomitant use is generally not recommended.
- **Iron supplements:**  May decrease iron absorption.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Contraindicated.  Saw palmetto has potential hormonal effects and should not be used during pregnancy.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Contraindicated.  It is unknown if saw palmetto is excreted in breast milk, and potential effects on nursing infants are unknown.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  5-alpha-reductase inhibition, potential anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects.
- **Side Effects:** Generally mild, including gastrointestinal upset, headache, and dizziness.  Rare but serious side effects include hepatic dysfunction and pancreatitis.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, pregnancy, breastfeeding.
- **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, estrogens, oral contraceptives, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, iron supplements.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
- **Dosage:** 320 mg/day of liposterolic extract, divided into one or two doses.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for LUTS improvement, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, and potential drug interactions.



## **Popular Combinations**

- Saw palmetto is sometimes combined with other herbal remedies for BPH, such as beta-sitosterol or pygeum africanum. However, the clinical evidence supporting these combinations is limited.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Assess for allergies, bleeding disorders, and concomitant medication use.
- **Specific Populations:**  Contraindicated in pregnant and breastfeeding women. Use with caution in patients with liver disease, diabetes, or those taking anticoagulants.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** No specific lifestyle restrictions are typically associated with saw palmetto use.
