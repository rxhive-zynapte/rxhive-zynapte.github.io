## **Usage**

Serratiopeptidase is a proteolytic enzyme, derived from the bacteria *Serratia marcescens*, used primarily for its anti-inflammatory and mucolytic properties.  It is prescribed for conditions involving pain, swelling, and inflammation such as:

* **Post-surgical inflammation and edema**:  Reduces swelling and pain following surgical procedures.
* **Traumatic injuries**:  Helps manage inflammation and pain associated with injuries.
* **Upper respiratory tract infections**:  Thins mucus secretions, aiding in conditions like sinusitis, bronchitis, and laryngitis.
* **Dental procedures**:  Manages inflammation and pain after dental surgeries.
* **Breast engorgement**: Alleviates pain and swelling in lactating women.

**Pharmacological Classification**:  Anti-inflammatory, mucolytic, proteolytic enzyme.

**Mechanism of Action**: Serratiopeptidase breaks down proteins like fibrin, bradykinin, and other inflammatory mediators, thereby reducing inflammation, swelling, and pain. It also thins mucus secretions, facilitating their clearance.

## **Alternate Names**

* Serrapeptase
* Serralysin
* Serratia peptidase


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics**: Serratiopeptidase exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by reducing the levels of inflammatory mediators. Its mucolytic action stems from its ability to break down mucus proteins, decreasing viscosity and promoting clearance.

**Pharmacokinetics**:  Orally administered serratiopeptidase is absorbed in the intestines after bypassing the stomach due to its enteric coating. It binds to alpha-2-macroglobulin in the bloodstream, retaining its enzymatic activity.

**Mode of Action**:  Serratiopeptidase hydrolyzes peptide bonds in proteins involved in inflammation (bradykinin, histamine), blood clotting (fibrin), and mucus formation, thereby reducing inflammation, improving microcirculation, and facilitating drainage of inflammatory exudates.


**Elimination Pathways**: Information on specific elimination pathways for serratiopeptidase is limited.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults**: 10 mg three times daily, taken on an empty stomach (30 minutes before or 2 hours after a meal). The dosage may range from 10 mg to 60 mg per day depending on the indication.  Some sources suggest an initial dose of 62.5 mg twice daily for four weeks, followed by 125 mg twice daily as a maintenance dose for PAH. As of February 17, 2025, this dosing regimen requires further verification and is not universally accepted.


#### **Children**:  Use in children under 10 is generally not recommended unless specifically directed by a physician. Pediatric dosing guidelines are not well-established and should be determined by a doctor based on weight and health status.

#### **Special Cases**:  Dose adjustments are necessary in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Consult a healthcare professional for personalized recommendations.  For elderly patients, a lower dose might be considered.

### **Clinical Use Cases**


Dosage in clinical settings varies depending on the specific indication and patient condition. Consultation with a specialist is essential.  Currently, there is limited data on serratiopeptidase dosage for clinical situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be necessary in patients with:

* Renal impairment
* Hepatic dysfunction
* Bleeding disorders
* Concomitant use of anticoagulants

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Abdominal discomfort
* Diarrhea
* Skin rashes
* Cough


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Eosinophilic pneumonitis
* Bullous pemphigoid
* Hemorrhage (especially in patients with Beh√ßet's disease)
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome
* Liver toxicity (increased liver enzymes)


### **Long-Term Effects**:  Long-term safety data for serratiopeptidase is limited.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**: The serious side effects listed above necessitate immediate medical attention.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to serratiopeptidase
* Active gastric ulcers or bleeding
* Pregnancy and breastfeeding
* Bleeding disorders
* Pre and post-surgical periods (2 weeks before and after)


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Anticoagulants/Antiplatelet drugs**: Increased risk of bleeding (warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel)
* **Nimesulide, Methotrexate, Lithium, Iodine**: Potential drug interactions warrant caution.
* **Hormonal contraceptives**:  Reduced effectiveness
* **Cyclosporine**: Increased risk of liver toxicity
* **Rifampin**: Possible reduced effectiveness of serratiopeptidase




## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Seratiopeptidase should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to limited safety data. It is contraindicated during pregnancy due to potential risks of birth defects, and its excretion in breast milk raises concerns about neonatal safety.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action**:  Proteolytic enzyme reducing inflammation and thinning mucus.
* **Side Effects**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rashes, cough, serious respiratory and dermatological reactions.
* **Contraindications**: Hypersensitivity, gastric ulcers, pregnancy, breastfeeding, bleeding disorders.
* **Drug Interactions**: Anticoagulants, NSAIDs, some antibiotics, hormonal contraceptives.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding**: Contraindicated.
* **Dosage**:  Adults: 10 mg thrice daily (may range 10-60 mg/day), empty stomach. Children: Not recommended.
* **Monitoring Parameters**: Monitor for gastrointestinal issues, skin reactions, and signs of bleeding. Liver function tests may be considered.

## **Popular Combinations**: Limited information is available on specific recommended combinations.

## **Precautions**

* Assess for allergies and bleeding disorders.
* Monitor liver function, especially with long-term use.
* Caution in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
* Discontinue use 2 weeks before scheduled surgery.
* Avoid alcohol and other interacting medications.
