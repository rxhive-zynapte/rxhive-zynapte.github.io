## **Usage**

Simethicone is prescribed for the relief of symptoms related to excessive gas in the gastrointestinal tract, such as bloating, pressure, and discomfort.  It falls under the pharmacological classification of an **antiflatulent** (or **anti-gas** agent).  It works by decreasing the surface tension of gas bubbles in the stomach and intestines, allowing them to coalesce into larger bubbles, which are easier to eliminate through belching or flatulence.

## **Alternate Names**

Simethicone is also known as activated dimethicone or activated dimeticone.  Brand names for simethicone include Gas-X, Mylicon, Phazyme, and Little Remedies Gas Relief Drops.  Many generic formulations are also available.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Simethicone acts locally in the GI tract.  It is an inert substance that doesn't get absorbed into the bloodstream. Its primary effect is the physical disruption of gas bubbles, not a chemical reaction. This defoaming action reduces the total surface area of the gas bubbles trapped within the digestive system, facilitating their passage.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Simethicone is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It is excreted unchanged in the feces. Therefore, there are no systemic effects, minimal metabolism, and no concerns about drug accumulation in the body. No receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation is involved.

**Elimination Pathways:** Simethicone is eliminated from the body via fecal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard dosage for adults and teenagers is 40 mg to 125 mg taken orally, four times a day after meals and at bedtime, as needed.  The maximum daily dose should not exceed 500 mg unless directed by a physician.  For chewable tablets, the dose can be up to 125 mg, four times a day, or 150 mg three times a day after meals, not exceeding 500 mg daily.

#### **Children:**

* **Infants and Children under 2 years:** 20 mg orally, four times a day after meals and at bedtime, as needed. The maximum daily dose is 240 mg.
* **Children 2 to 12 years:** 40 mg orally, four times a day after meals and at bedtime, as needed. The maximum daily dose is 480 mg.  Weight-based dosing is recommended when possible: 20 mg for children weighing less than 10.9 kg and 40 mg for those weighing 10.9 kg or more.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically necessary for elderly patients. However, consider their overall health and any other medications they're taking.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustments are needed as simethicone is not absorbed systemically.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustments are needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution with concomitant use of levothyroxine; separate administration by at least four hours.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The standard dosage recommendations generally apply to all clinical settings. While simethicone may be used in some cases before diagnostic imaging procedures (e.g., gastroscopy, radiography of the intestine) to reduce interference from gas bubbles, it is not typically used during intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or in the ICU for specific therapeutic purposes related to these procedures.  Its primary use remains the symptomatic relief of gas.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments based on renal or hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms are not needed.  Always consider individual patient factors and monitor for any adverse reactions.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Simethicone is generally well-tolerated.  Mild and infrequent side effects may include constipation, diarrhea, nausea, and headaches.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions are rare but can occur. Symptoms include rash, itching, facial swelling, tongue swelling, difficulty breathing, and dizziness. Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.

### **Long-Term Effects**

No long-term adverse effects are known to be associated with simethicone use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs are rare.  Allergic reactions are the most serious and require immediate medical intervention.

## **Contraindications**

The only absolute contraindication is a known hypersensitivity to simethicone.

## **Drug Interactions**

A clinically significant interaction exists with levothyroxine (and related thyroid medications). Simethicone can reduce the absorption of levothyroxine, potentially leading to hypothyroidism. Administer these medications at least four hours apart.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Simethicone is considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding (Pregnancy Category C). It is not absorbed systemically and therefore does not reach the fetus or pass into breast milk in significant amounts.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Reduces surface tension of gas bubbles in the GI tract, promoting their coalescence and elimination.
* **Side Effects:** Generally well-tolerated; mild and infrequent side effects include constipation, diarrhea, nausea, and headaches.  Rarely, allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to simethicone.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Levothyroxine.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Safe to use.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 40-125 mg, up to four times daily; Children: 20-40 mg based on age/weight, up to four times daily.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Primarily symptomatic relief; monitor for allergic reactions.

## **Popular Combinations**

Simethicone is often combined with antacids (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium carbonate) to address both gas and heartburn.  It is sometimes combined with loperamide for the treatment of diarrhea and associated gas.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess for allergies to simethicone.  Chew chewable tablets thoroughly before swallowing. Do not chew liquid-filled capsules.
* **Specific Populations:** No specific precautions for pregnant/breastfeeding women, children, or elderly individuals beyond standard dosing adjustments.
