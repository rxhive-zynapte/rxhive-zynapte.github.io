## **Usage**

- Sodium Acetate Injection, USP is primarily indicated as a source of sodium for addition to large volume intravenous (IV) fluids to prevent or correct hyponatremia (low sodium levels) in patients with restricted or no oral intake. It is also used as an additive when formulating specific IV fluids tailored to individual patient needs that cannot be met by standard electrolyte or nutrient solutions.  In neonatal care, it is used for the prevention and treatment of metabolic acidosis and as an alternative for correcting hyponatremia in the presence of acidosis.
- **Pharmacological classification:**  Electrolyte, fluid replenisher, and alkalizing agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Sodium acetate dissociates into sodium and acetate ions. Sodium is the primary extracellular cation and plays a crucial role in maintaining fluid balance, nerve and muscle function. Acetate is metabolized in the liver to bicarbonate, thereby acting as an alkalinizing agent that helps correct metabolic acidosis by increasing plasma bicarbonate concentration.

## **Alternate Names**

- Sodium acetate anhydrous
- Trihydrate sodium acetate
- Brand names: Numerous generic formulations exist, and brand names may vary regionally.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Sodium acetate exerts its effects primarily through the sodium and acetate ions. Sodium is essential for maintaining osmotic pressure, fluid balance, and nerve and muscle function.  Acetate is metabolized to bicarbonate, which buffers excess hydrogen ions, increasing blood pH and correcting acidosis.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Administered intravenously, therefore 100% bioavailability.
    - **Metabolism:** Acetate is rapidly metabolized in the liver to bicarbonate.
    - **Elimination:**  Sodium is primarily excreted by the kidneys.  Bicarbonate is regulated by the body's acid-base balance mechanisms.
- **Mode of Action:** Sodium acetate does not bind to receptors, inhibit enzymes, or directly modulate neurotransmitters.  Its action relies on the physiological properties of sodium and its conversion to bicarbonate.
- **Elimination pathways:** Sodium is primarily excreted by the kidneys, while bicarbonate, the product of acetate metabolism, is regulated through the body's natural acid-base homeostasis mechanisms.


## **Dosage**

Sodium Acetate Injection, USP must be diluted before use.  Dosage and administration rate are dependent on individual patient needs. Serum sodium should be monitored to guide dosage adjustments.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Dose and rate of administration depend on the individual patient needs and clinical situation.  
- Typical maintenance electrolyte requirements for sodium in parenteral nutrition are 1-2 mEq/kg/24 hours.


#### **Children:**

- Dose is determined based on the child's weight, age, clinical and biological condition, and concomitant therapy.
- Neonates: 1-3 mmol/kg/day as a 24-hour infusion diluted to either sodium acetate 0.9% or 3%. Higher doses may be used under the supervision of the medical team.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Start with lower doses and titrate cautiously, considering the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and potential drug interactions.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; sodium retention may occur. Monitor serum sodium closely. This product contains aluminum, which can accumulate and cause toxicity in patients with renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution in severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider individual patient needs and comorbidities when determining dose and rate of administration. Closely monitor serum sodium and acid-base balance.

### **Clinical Use Cases:**

- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations:** Dose and rate of administration are tailored to individual patient needs based on fluid and electrolyte balance, acid-base status, and overall clinical picture.  Serum sodium should be closely monitored.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- Dosage should be adjusted based on patient-specific factors such as renal/hepatic function, fluid status, acid-base balance, concomitant medications, and underlying medical conditions.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Sodium overload (confusion, increased thirst, muscle weakness, unusual weakness or fatigue, twitching muscles).
- Fluid overload (swelling in the arms or legs, shortness of breath, rapid weight gain).
- Electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hypocalcemia).
- Localized phlebitis or thrombosis at the infusion site.
- Abdominal distention or flatulence.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Pulmonary edema.
- Allergic reactions (skin rash, itching, hives, swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat).
- Hypernatremia (severe thirst, restlessness, seizures, coma).
- Metabolic alkalosis (confusion, lightheadedness, muscle twitching, nausea, vomiting).


### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Long-term complications are generally associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalances rather than directly with sodium acetate itself.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

-  Serious hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis).
- Severe hypernatremia or metabolic alkalosis.
- Aluminum toxicity (in patients with renal impairment).

## **Contraindications**

- Hypernatremia.
- Fluid retention.
- Metabolic or respiratory alkalosis
- Hypocalcemia



## **Drug Interactions**

- May increase renal clearance of acidic drugs (e.g., salicylates, barbiturates, tetracyclines).
- May decrease renal clearance of basic drugs (e.g., amphetamine, quinidine, pseudoephedrine).
- Corticosteroids or corticotropin may exacerbate sodium and fluid retention.
-  Monitor patients receiving other medications that affect electrolyte balance.
- Consult a comprehensive drug interaction database for specific potential interactions.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted. Use only if clearly needed and if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus. Sodium levels should be closely monitored.
- **Breastfeeding:** Sodium is present in breast milk.  Consult with a physician to assess the risk/benefit ratio.
