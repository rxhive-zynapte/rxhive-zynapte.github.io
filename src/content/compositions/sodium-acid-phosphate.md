      What patient education should be provided when prescribing Sodium acid
      phosphate?**


      **A:** Counsel patients on the importance of proper administration
      (dissolving tablets in water), potential side effects (especially GI
      related), the need for adequate hydration, and the importance of regular
      monitoring of blood parameters. Advise patients to report any significant
      side effects immediately. Emphasize strict adherence to the prescribed
      dosage and to avoid using other phosphate-containing laxatives or enemas
      concurrently without consulting a physician.

## **Usage**

Sodium acid phosphate is prescribed for the treatment of:

- **Hypercalcemia:** Elevated blood calcium levels due to conditions such as hyperparathyroidism, multiple myeloma, and other cancers.
- **Hypophosphatemia:** Low blood phosphate levels caused by vitamin D-resistant rickets and osteomalacia.

It is classified as a phosphate supplement/binder and a laxative. It can also be used as a urinary acidifier.

**Mechanism of Action (Hypercalcemia):** Phosphate ions bind to calcium in the gut, reducing calcium absorption and increasing its excretion.
**Mechanism of Action (Hypophosphatemia):** Provides a source of phosphate to replenish depleted levels.
**Mechanism of Action (Laxative):**  Sodium phosphate acts as an osmotic laxative, drawing water into the intestinal lumen, softening the stool, and stimulating bowel movements.
**Mechanism of Action (Urinary acidifier):** Metabolized to phosphoric acid in the kidneys which increases urine acidity.

## **Alternate Names**

- **Monosodium phosphate**
- **Sodium dihydrogen phosphate**
- **Phosphate Sandoz (Brand name)**
- **Fleet Enema (Brand name, for rectal sodium phosphate)**
- **K-Phos (Brand name, in combination with Potassium phosphate)**



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**
- **Hypercalcemia:** Lowers serum calcium levels by forming insoluble calcium phosphate salts in the gut and reducing its intestinal absorption.
- **Hypophosphatemia:** Elevates serum phosphate levels directly.
- **Laxative:** Increases intraluminal osmotic pressure, drawing water into the intestine and stimulating peristalsis.
- **Urinary acidifier:** Increases urinary acidity by releasing hydrogen ions.



**Pharmacokinetics:**
- **Absorption:** Oral absorption is variable and incomplete, but generally adequate for managing the abovementioned conditions. Rectal administration facilitates more rapid absorption.
- **Metabolism:** Limited metabolism, some conversion to phosphoric acid occurs in the kidneys.
- **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion, also excreted via feces as calcium and magnesium phosphate salts.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Hypercalcemia:** Up to 6 tablets daily, dissolved in 50-70ml of water. Dosage adjustment based on individual patient response and serum calcium levels.
- **Hypophosphatemia:** 4-6 tablets daily, dissolved in 50-70ml of water.

#### **Children:**

- **Hypercalcemia:** Up to 3 tablets daily (for children 5 years and older). Dosage adjustment as needed.
- **Hypophosphatemia:** 2-3 tablets daily (for children 5 years and older).

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Careful dosage titration is recommended, starting at the lower end of the dosing range, due to potential age-related decline in renal function. Monitor serum calcium, phosphate, and electrolytes.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Dosage adjustment may be necessary. Close monitoring of renal function, electrolyte levels, and serum phosphate is essential.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Safety and efficacy not fully established. Use with caution, close monitoring advised.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution in patients with heart failure, arrhythmia, angina, cardiomyopathy, electrolyte disturbances, or a history of seizures.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  Dosage information for specific medical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations is not available in the provided sources.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on serum calcium, phosphate, and creatinine levels, as well as individual patient response and tolerance. Renal and hepatic impairment necessitate cautious dose adjustments and monitoring.
