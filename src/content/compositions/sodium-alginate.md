## **Usage**

Sodium alginate is primarily prescribed for the symptomatic treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).  This includes heartburn, acid regurgitation, and indigestion caused by reflux of stomach contents. It's also used for the relief of symptoms related to excess stomach acid (hyperacidity). Sodium alginate is classified as an antacid. Its mechanism of action involves forming a physical barrier against acid reflux.

## **Alternate Names**

Sodium alginate is often combined with other antacids like sodium bicarbonate and calcium carbonate.  Brand names for products containing sodium alginate include Gaviscon, Gaviscon Advance, Acidex, Asda Heartburn and Indigestion Liquid, Boots Heartburn Relief, Peptac Liquid, and others.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Sodium alginate forms a viscous gel, or "raft," on the surface of stomach contents upon contact with gastric acid. This gel acts as a physical barrier, preventing reflux of acidic contents into the esophagus. The addition of antacids like sodium bicarbonate and calcium carbonate provides a neutralizing effect on stomach acid, enhancing symptom relief. The raft may also reflux into the esophagus, exerting a soothing effect.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Sodium alginate is minimally absorbed systemically. Its action is primarily physical within the gastrointestinal tract.  Maternal alginate absorption is limited, and alginates are not significantly metabolized. Therefore, they are considered acceptable for use during lactation.

**Mode of Action:** The mode of action is primarily physical and does not rely on systemic absorption or receptor binding. The alginate interacts with gastric acid, transforming into a gel that floats on the stomach contents. 

**Elimination:**  Sodium alginate is primarily eliminated through fecal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 10-20 mL (liquid formulations) or 2-4 tablets (chewable tablets) after meals and at bedtime, up to four times a day. Gaviscon Advance, with double the sodium alginate concentration, may offer longer-lasting relief.

#### **Children:** Dosing for children under 12 years should be determined by a doctor. For children 6-11 years old, a dose of 5-10 mL (1 sachet) after meals and before bedtime is often recommended. Products containing sodium alginate are generally not recommended for children under 6 years old.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  No dose adjustment is typically necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised due to the sodium content, especially in those on a highly restricted salt diet.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is typically necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised for patients with hypercalcemia, nephrocalcinosis, or recurrent calcium-containing renal calculi due to the calcium content in some formulations.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosage guidelines mentioned above apply across various clinical settings, including intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) use, and emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments might be necessary in cases of severe reflux or esophageal inflammation, where doubling the standard dose might be considered.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Bloating, flatulence, nausea, altered sense of taste, mild constipation, or diarrhea. These are generally mild and transient.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, skin rash, itching, difficulty breathing, dizziness, swelling), bronchospasm. Seek immediate medical attention if these occur.


### **Long-Term Effects**

No significant long-term effects have been reported with the use of sodium alginate. However, prolonged use should generally be avoided, and the clinical situation should be reviewed if symptoms persist after seven days.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Anaphylactic reaction/shock, bronchospasm, urticaria. These require immediate medical intervention.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to sodium alginate or any other components of the formulation. Moderate to severe renal insufficiency.

## **Drug Interactions**

Sodium alginate can decrease the absorption of certain medications, including tetracycline antibiotics, some cardiac drugs, iron supplements, and other drugs that require an acidic environment for optimal absorption. It is advised to separate the administration of sodium alginate and other medications by at least two hours. Interactions with antacids may also occur.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Sodium alginate is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Studies and post-marketing experience have not shown evidence of harmful effects on the fetus or newborn. However, consulting a healthcare provider before use is always recommended.
