      How does Sodium Cromoglycate differ from antihistamines?**


      **A:**  Sodium Cromoglycate prevents the release of histamine and other
      mediators from mast cells, while antihistamines block the action of
      histamine after it has been released.  Sodium Cromoglycate is therefore
      preventative, while antihistamines treat existing symptoms.

## **Usage**

Sodium Cromoglycate is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of various allergic conditions.  Its primary use is in managing allergic rhinitis, asthma, allergic conjunctivitis, and mastocytosis. It is also used off-label for food allergies.

It is pharmacologically classified as a mast cell stabilizer.

Sodium Cromoglycate works by stabilizing mast cells, preventing the release of histamine, leukotrienes, and other inflammatory mediators responsible for allergic symptoms.

## **Alternate Names**

Sodium Cromoglicate, Cromolyn Sodium, Cromoglicic Acid

**Brand Names:**  Intal, Opticrom, Nalcrom, Gastrocrom, Rynacrom (and others, which may vary regionally)

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Sodium Cromoglycate acts locally to stabilize mast cell membranes. This prevents degranulation and the release of mediators like histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins, which are responsible for the inflammatory response in allergic reactions.  It also inhibits the activation of sensory nerves involved in the cough reflex.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Sodium Cromoglycate is poorly absorbed orally (<1%). Inhaled drug is also minimally absorbed from the lungs and the remaining drug that is swallowed is poorly absorbed from the GI tract. Peak plasma concentration is typically reached within 15 minutes to 1 hour after inhalation, depending on the formulation. When administered intranasally, it can be absorbed locally in the nasal cavity, offering direct targeting of mast cells in that region. It is excreted primarily unchanged in the bile and urine. The half life is approximately 80 minutes.

**Mode of Action:** The precise mechanism is not fully elucidated but involves inhibiting calcium influx into mast cells, thus preventing degranulation. No specific receptor binding or enzyme inhibition is identified. It doesn't modulate neurotransmitters directly, but by preventing mediator release, it indirectly affects neurogenic inflammation.

**Elimination:** Primarily excreted unchanged in the bile (87%) and urine (10%), with minimal metabolism.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral (Capsules):** 200 mg four times daily, 15-20 minutes before meals.  This may be doubled if symptoms aren't controlled, not to exceed 40 mg/kg/day.
* **Inhalation (Nebulizer):** 20 mg four times daily.
* **Eye Drops:** 1-2 drops in each eye four times daily.
* **Nasal Spray:**  One spray in each nostril several times daily.

#### **Children:**

* **Oral (Capsules):**  100 mg four times daily, 15-20 minutes before meals. Maximum dose: 40 mg/kg/day.
* **Inhalation (Nebulizer):**  10-20 mg four times daily.  Pediatric safety for those under 2 years old has not been established.
* **Eye Drops:** 1-2 drops in each eye four times daily.
* **Nasal Spray:**  One spray in each nostril several times daily.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start at the lower end of the dosing range due to potential for reduced renal/hepatic function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage should be individualized, considering potential drug interactions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The primary usage of sodium cromoglycate does not involve intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its main clinical utility lies in prophylactic management of allergic conditions.  While some research suggests potential neuroprotective effects, it is not a standard treatment in those settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are based on patient response, renal/hepatic function, and other clinical factors.  Therapeutic drug monitoring is not routinely performed.

* Pneumonitis
* Anaphylaxis (rare)

### **Long-Term Effects:**

No specific long-term side effects are typically associated with sodium cromoglycate.
