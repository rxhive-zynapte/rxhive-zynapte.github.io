  - q: >-
      How is Sodium Feredetate different from other iron supplements?**


      **A:**  Sodium feredetate contains iron in a chelated form, which is
      generally better tolerated and less likely to cause gastrointestinal side
      effects compared to some other iron salts. It also does not stain teeth.

      Can sodium feredetate be taken with food?**


      **A:**  While it’s generally recommended to take sodium feredetate between
      meals for optimal absorption, it can be taken with food if
      gastrointestinal upset occurs. Avoid taking it with milk, dairy products,
      antacids, or eggs, as these can interfere with absorption.

## **Usage**

- Sodium feredetate is prescribed for the treatment and prevention of iron deficiency anemia.  It is particularly useful in cases where other oral iron preparations are not well-tolerated.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Iron supplement, hematinic.
- **Mechanism of action:** Sodium feredetate provides a source of iron, which is essential for hemoglobin synthesis. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body.  By replenishing iron stores, sodium feredetate helps the body produce more red blood cells and hemoglobin, thereby correcting the anemia.

## **Alternate Names**

- Sodium iron edetate
- **Brand names:** Sytron®, SodiFer®, Feredet®

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Sodium feredetate increases hemoglobin levels and red blood cell count in individuals with iron deficiency anemia. This improves oxygen delivery to tissues.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Primarily absorbed in the duodenum and jejunum (small intestine). Absorption is enhanced in an acidic environment and by the presence of vitamin C. Milk, dairy products, antacids, and certain antibiotics can interfere with absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** The iron in sodium feredetate is incorporated into hemoglobin within red blood cells.
    - **Elimination:**  Primarily excreted in feces; small amounts are eliminated in urine and bile.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Treatment:** 5-10 mL three times daily. The dose may be gradually increased based on the individual's response and tolerance.
- **Prophylaxis:**  Dosage varies depending on individual needs and risk factors for iron deficiency.

#### **Children:**

- **Treatment:** 3-6 mg of elemental iron per kg of body weight daily, divided into 2-3 doses. (Note: 5 mL of sodium feredetate solution typically contains 27.5 mg of elemental iron).
- **Prophylaxis:** Dosage varies depending on age, feeding method, and risk factors. For example, preterm, exclusively breastfed infants may receive 0.9 mL (approximately 5 mg of elemental iron) daily, starting around 4-6 weeks after birth.
- **Pediatric safety considerations:**  Carefully measure and administer the correct dose to avoid accidental overdose.  Liquid preparations should be administered with an oral syringe or medicine spoon to ensure accurate dosing.  Keep out of reach of children.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Similar dosing to adults, but start with a lower dose and titrate up as tolerated. Monitor for gastrointestinal side effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary based on the degree of impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution; monitor liver function tests.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Dosage adjustments may be needed in patients with certain gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, peptic ulcer disease).

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing in specific clinical settings generally follows the standard adult and pediatric guidelines outlined above.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments are based on individual patient factors, including response to therapy, tolerance of side effects, and the presence of comorbid conditions.  Serum ferritin and hemoglobin levels should be monitored to assess the effectiveness of treatment.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Constipation
- Diarrhea
- Dark stools (harmless)
