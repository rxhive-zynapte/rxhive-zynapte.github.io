      What is the difference between sodium lactate and sodium bicarbonate in

      **A:**  Sodium lactate works by being converted to bicarbonate in the
      liver, whereas sodium bicarbonate directly provides bicarbonate.  Sodium
      lactate is not suitable for severe acidosis needing immediate correction.
      It is contraindicated in lactic acidosis.

## **Usage**

- Sodium Lactate is prescribed for the prevention or control of mild to moderate metabolic acidosis in patients with restricted oral intake, particularly when oxidative processes are not severely impaired.  It's also used for fluid resuscitation in hypovolemia, hypotension, and conditions with extracellular fluid loss. It can also be used as a vehicle for compatible intravenous drugs.  Compound Sodium Lactate Solution (Hartmann's/Ringer's Lactate) is used for fluid and electrolyte replacement, as a source of bicarbonate for mild to moderate metabolic acidosis (excluding lactic acidosis), and as a vehicle for intravenous drug delivery.

- **Pharmacological classification:**  Systemic alkalizer, fluid and electrolyte replenisher.

- **Mechanism of action:**  Sodium lactate is metabolized in the liver to bicarbonate, thereby increasing blood bicarbonate levels and raising pH, correcting acidosis.

## **Alternate Names**

- Sodium lactate solution; Hartmann's solution; Ringer's lactate solution; Compound Sodium Lactate Solution for Infusion BP.

- **Brand Names:**  Aviva.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Sodium lactate is metabolized in the liver to bicarbonate, increasing blood bicarbonate concentration and raising pH. This conversion depends on adequate liver function and perfusion.  The sodium content helps restore extracellular fluid volume.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Administered intravenously, lactate is rapidly distributed in the extracellular compartment and metabolized primarily in the liver to bicarbonate.  Excretion of lactate is negligible, with the primary route of elimination being through its conversion to bicarbonate, which is then regulated by the body's acid-base homeostasis mechanisms. Clearance of lactate can be reduced in hepatic insufficiency.

- **Mode of Action:** The lactate anion is converted to bicarbonate in the liver via the Cori cycle. This involves the oxidation of lactate to pyruvate, followed by the carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate, which is then decarboxylated to phosphoenolpyruvate and finally converted to glucose.  This process consumes hydrogen ions (H+), thereby increasing pH. Sodium contributes to extracellular fluid volume expansion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- 500 ml to 3 L/24h IV.
- Infusion rate: Usually 40 mL/kg/24h. In medical emergencies or surgery, higher infusion rates and volumes may be necessary, depending on the patient's fluid and electrolyte requirements.



#### **Children:**
- 20 to 100 mL/kg/24h IV.
- Pediatric infusion rates vary with age: 6–8 mL/kg/h for infants, 4–6 mL/kg/h for toddlers, and 2–4 mL/kg/h for older children.
- For burns: 3.4 mL/kg/percent burn at 24 hours and 6.3 mL/kg/percent burn at 48 hours post-burn.
- For head injuries: 2850 mL/m².
- Caution is advised in neonates and infants less than six months.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly patients:** Adjust dosage based on renal and hepatic function and comorbid conditions.
- **Patients with renal impairment:** Administer with caution due to potential sodium and potassium retention. Adjust dosage based on creatinine clearance.
- **Patients with hepatic dysfunction:** Administer with caution due to impaired lactate metabolism.
- **Patients with comorbid conditions:** Adjust dosage based on individual needs.


### **Clinical Use Cases:**

- **Intubation:** As part of fluid resuscitation during and after the procedure.
- **Surgical Procedures:** For perioperative fluid management.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** As part of fluid and electrolyte management.
- **ICU Use:** For fluid and electrolyte management in critically ill patients.
- **Emergency Situations:** For rapid fluid resuscitation in hypovolemic or hypotensive shock. Initial bolus: Adults: 250 ml IV; Children: 20 ml/kg IV. Repeated as needed.


### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- Adjust dosage based on patient factors such as age, weight, clinical condition, renal and hepatic function, concomitant medications, and clinical and laboratory response.
- Monitor serum electrolytes, acid-base balance, and fluid status before and during administration.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
-  Edema, hypernatremia, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, metabolic alkalosis.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
-  Pulmonary edema, cardiac arrhythmias, tetany (due to calcium excess), mental confusion.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and immunosuppressants (such as tacrolimus and cyclosporine) can increase risk of hyperkalemia.
- Corticosteroids and corticotropin can increase sodium retention.
- Sodium bicarbonate is an additive incompatibility.




## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
