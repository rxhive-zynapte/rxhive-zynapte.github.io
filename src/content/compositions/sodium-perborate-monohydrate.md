## **Usage**

- Sodium perborate monohydrate is primarily used as an oral cleanser in the management of periodontal conditions.  It can be prescribed to treat canker sores, denture irritation, orthodontic irritation, and after dental procedures.  It is not typically used for systemic medical conditions.
- **Pharmacological classification:**  Oxidizing agent, antiseptic.
- **Mechanism of action:** Sodium perborate monohydrate releases oxygen when in contact with water, creating an antiseptic and cleansing effect in the oral cavity.  The released oxygen helps to debride the affected area and inhibit the growth of anaerobic bacteria.

## **Alternate Names**

- Sodium peroxyborate monohydrate
- Perboric acid, sodium salt, monohydrate
- CAS No.: 10332-33-9
- **Brand Name:** Bocasan (historical)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Sodium perborate exerts its effects through the release of oxygen. This creates an oxidizing environment hostile to anaerobic microorganisms, providing a localized antiseptic effect.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Sodium perborate monohydrate is not intended for systemic absorption. When used as an oral rinse, it is dissolved in water and the solution is expectorated. Minimal systemic absorption is expected. The small amounts absorbed are broken down into borate and excreted primarily by the kidneys.
- **Mode of action:** The release of oxygen creates an oxidizing environment. This oxidizing action disrupts bacterial cell membranes and inhibits bacterial growth.
- **Elimination pathways:**  Borate, the metabolic byproduct of sodium perborate, is primarily excreted renally.

## **Dosage**

As sodium perborate monohydrate is not commonly prescribed today, dosage information is based on historical usage and product formulations like Bocasan.

### **Standard Dosage**
#### **Adults:**
Historically, the contents of a 1.7-gram packet (containing approximately 1.2g sodium perborate monohydrate) were dissolved in 30 ml of warm water. Half of this solution was used as a mouthwash for two minutes and then discarded. This process was repeated with the remaining solution.  The recommended frequency was three times daily after meals.

#### **Children:**
Historically, use was recommended for children over 5 years old with the same dosage as adults.  However, current pediatric recommendations are lacking due to limited contemporary use.

#### **Special Cases:**
Data on dosage adjustments in special populations is not readily available given the limited current clinical use of sodium perborate monohydrate.

### **Clinical Use Cases**
Historically, it has been used in the following clinical contexts:
- **Post-dental procedures:**  To promote healing and prevent infection.
- **Periodontal conditions:**  As an adjunct to treatment for gingivitis and other periodontal diseases.


### **Dosage Adjustments**
Due to the historical nature of the drug's use and the topical application, specific dosage adjustments are not well-defined.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
- Transient mild irritation or burning sensation in the mouth
- Temporary alteration in taste perception

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Allergic reactions (e.g., rash, itching, swelling)

### **Long-Term Effects**
Long-term effects of sodium perborate monohydrate oral use are not well-documented due to limited current clinical application.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Severe allergic reactions are possible but rare.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to sodium perborate or any of its components.
- Children under 5 years old (based on historical recommendations).

## **Drug Interactions**
Clinically significant drug interactions with topical sodium perborate monohydrate are not well-documented.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
The safety of using sodium perborate monohydrate during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been definitively established.  It is generally recommended to avoid use unless specifically advised by a healthcare professional.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Releases oxygen, creating an antiseptic effect.
