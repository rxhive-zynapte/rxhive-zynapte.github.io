      How does sodium phosphate differ from other laxatives?**


      **A:** Sodium phosphate is a hyperosmotic laxative.  It works by drawing
      water into the intestines, stimulating bowel movement.  Unlike stimulant
      laxatives, it doesn't directly irritate the intestines.

## **Usage**

Sodium Phosphate is prescribed for the relief of occasional constipation and for bowel cleansing prior to certain medical procedures such as colonoscopies or radiography. It is classified as a saline laxative, specifically a hyperosmotic laxative.  Its mechanism of action involves increasing fluid in the small intestine, leading to bowel movement.

## **Alternate Names**

Sodium Phosphates, Monobasic Sodium Phosphate, Dibasic Sodium Phosphate. Brand names include Fleet Phospho-Soda, OsmoPrep, and Visicol.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Sodium phosphate exerts its laxative effect by increasing osmotic pressure within the intestinal lumen. This draws water into the intestine, softening the stool and increasing its volume.  This stimulates peristalsis and leads to bowel evacuation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Oral sodium phosphate is absorbed systemically, whereas rectal administration leads to limited systemic absorption. 
* **Metabolism:** Sodium phosphate is not metabolized.
* **Elimination:**  Sodium and phosphate ions are primarily excreted by the kidneys.  A small portion may be eliminated in the feces.


## **Dosage**

**Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral Solution for Constipation:** 19 grams/7 grams per 118 mL bottle; 19 grams/7 grams per 197 mL bottle. Administer one bottle orally. Not to exceed 1 administration/24 hours. 

* **Oral Solution for Bowel Cleansing (e.g., Colonoscopy):** As directed by physician; typically two doses of 45 mL with at least 12 hours in between.

* **Rectal (Enema):** 1 bottle (adult dose) administered rectally. Not to exceed one administration/24 hours.

#### **Children:**

* **Oral Solution:** Not recommended for children under 5 years old unless directed by a doctor. Dosages need to be adjusted according to age and weight, consulting specific pediatric guidelines.

* **Rectal (Enema):** 
    * Not recommended for children younger than 2 years old.
    * 2-4 years:  Half a bottle (~30 mL) of pediatric enema.
    * 5-11 years: One bottle (59 mL) of pediatric enema.
    * 12 years and older: Adult dosage.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients, Patients with Renal Impairment, Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction, Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution. Lower starting doses and careful monitoring of electrolytes and renal function are necessary. Discuss with a physician to determine if this medication is suitable or if dosage adjustments are necessary. Pre-existing electrolyte disturbances or concomitant use of diuretics or other medications that may alter electrolytes require careful consideration.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in clinical use cases should be guided by the specific requirements of each situation and standardized protocols.  Physician oversight is crucial.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are necessary for renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms that affect drug metabolism.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Stomach pain, nausea, bloating, gas, dizziness, headache, and chills.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, swelling),  irregular heartbeat, kidney injury (decreased urination, swelling), seizures, electrolyte imbalances (hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia), dehydration.


### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic kidney disease can occur with overuse of sodium phosphate.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions, cardiac arrhythmias, acute phosphate nephropathy.


## **Contraindications**

Absolute contraindications include: hypersensitivity to sodium phosphate, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, gastrointestinal obstruction, gastric bypass/stapling surgery, bowel perforation, toxic colitis, toxic megacolon. Relative contraindications include congestive heart failure and active inflammatory bowel disease.

## **Drug Interactions**

Sodium phosphate can interact with drugs affecting renal function (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, diuretics, NSAIDs), hormonal contraceptives (reduced efficacy),  calcium and aluminum-containing antacids (reduced phosphate absorption), and other medications such as cyclosporine (increased liver toxicity) and warfarin (altered anticoagulant effect).



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category: C (FDA - old system).  Use only if clearly needed, weighing the benefits against potential risks.  Consult with a physician.  It is unknown if sodium phosphate is excreted in breast milk.  Caution is recommended. Expressing and discarding breast milk from the first dose until 24 hours after the second dose may minimize infant exposure.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Hyperosmotic laxative; increases fluid in the intestines, stimulating peristalsis.
* **Side Effects:** Common: Stomach pain, nausea, bloating. Serious: Electrolyte imbalances, kidney damage.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, hypernatremia, GI obstruction, bowel perforation.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Renal-affecting drugs, hormonal contraceptives, certain antacids.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category C; Caution advised. 
* **Dosage:** Varies depending on the route, indication, and patient-specific factors.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Electrolytes (sodium, phosphorus, calcium, potassium), renal function.


## **Popular Combinations**

Sodium phosphate is usually used alone.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Patient evaluation, including medical history and concomitant medications, is necessary before administering sodium phosphate. Monitoring electrolytes and renal function is essential, especially in high-risk individuals.
* **Specific Populations:** Pregnant/breastfeeding women: use cautiously. Children and elderly: dose adjustments necessary; monitor for adverse effects. Patients with renal/hepatic impairment: dosage modifications are essential.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Adequate hydration is vital to minimize dehydration risk.
