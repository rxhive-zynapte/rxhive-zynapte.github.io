## **Usage**

- Sodium Picosulfate is primarily prescribed for the short-term relief of occasional constipation. It is also used for bowel cleansing prior to diagnostic procedures like colonoscopies or surgeries requiring an empty bowel.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Stimulant laxative.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Sodium Picosulfate is a prodrug that is metabolized by colonic bacteria into its active form, bis-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-pyridyl-2-methane (BHPM). BHPM stimulates the mucosa of the large intestine, increasing peristalsis and water accumulation in the colon, leading to easier bowel movements.

## **Alternate Names**

- Sodium picosulphate (International Nonproprietary Name - INN)
- **Brand Names:**  Laxoberal, Regulax, Dulcolax Pico, Picolax (combined with magnesium citrate), Prepopik (combined with magnesium oxide and anhydrous citric acid), Clenpiq (combined with magnesium oxide and anhydrous citric acid)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Sodium Picosulfate's active metabolite (BHPM) acts directly on the colonic mucosa, increasing peristaltic activity and inhibiting water absorption. This results in softer stools and promotes bowel evacuation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Sodium Picosulfate itself has low oral bioavailability.  It's metabolized by intestinal bacteria into BHPM, which is the active form. BHPM is minimally absorbed systemically. The onset of action is typically 6-12 hours after oral administration. Elimination primarily occurs through fecal excretion, with a small amount excreted in urine.
- **Mode of Action:** BHPM stimulates sensory nerve endings in the colonic mucosa, triggering the defecation reflex and increasing intestinal motility.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** The exact mechanism is not fully understood, but is known to be local action on the colonic mucosa and stimulating sensory nerve endings.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily fecal excretion. Limited urinary excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 5-10 mg orally, once daily, preferably at bedtime.  May increase to a maximum of 20 mg/day if necessary.

#### **Children:**

- *1 month to <4 years:* 0.25 mg/kg/day (maximum 5mg/day)
- *4-10 years:* 2.5-5 mg/day
- *>10 years:* 5-10 mg/day.
- All pediatric doses are given once daily, preferably at bedtime. 

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lowest dose (5mg) and titrate cautiously based on response. Consider dividing the dose if frail.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Close monitoring of electrolytes is recommended.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider patient-specific factors such as dehydration, heart disease, electrolyte imbalances.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations:** Dosing determined based on the specific clinical indication, patient factors, and in consultation with specialists.  Usually prescribed as part of bowel preparation regimens.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

-  Dose adjustments should be individualized based on patient response and tolerance.
-  In patients with renal impairment, magnesium-containing formulations should be avoided or used with extreme caution.
- In patients with underlying electrolyte imbalances, monitor electrolyte levels and correct abnormalities before starting therapy.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Diarrhea
- Abdominal discomfort (pain, cramps, bloating)
- Nausea
- Dehydration (especially with overuse)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, swelling)
- Severe dehydration
- Electrolyte imbalances (hypokalaemia)
- Cardiac arrhythmias
- Seizures
- Ischemic colitis (with excessive doses)

### **Long-Term Effects**

-  Chronic diarrhea
-  Electrolyte imbalances
-  Dependence on laxatives
-  Potential for colonic damage with chronic overuse


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

-  Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
-  Ischemic colitis


## **Contraindications**

- Ileus or intestinal obstruction
- Acute surgical abdomen (e.g., appendicitis)
- Acute inflammatory bowel disease
- Severe dehydration
- Hypersensitivity to sodium picosulfate or any components of the formulation
-  Rhabdomyolysis
- Hypermagnesemia (for magnesium-containing formulations)


## **Drug Interactions**

- **Antibiotics:** May reduce the laxative effect of sodium picosulfate.
- **Diuretics and Corticosteroids:** May increase the risk of electrolyte imbalances.
- **Cardiac Glycosides:** Electrolyte imbalances caused by sodium picosulfate may increase sensitivity to cardiac glycosides.
- **Other Medications:** Concomitant use with drugs that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) should be done with caution.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Not formally assigned. Limited human data. Animal studies suggest low risk, but use only if clearly needed and benefits outweigh risks.
- **Breastfeeding:** Sodium picosulfate is minimally excreted in breast milk. Generally considered safe during breastfeeding.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Stimulates colonic motility and inhibits water absorption.
- **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, dehydration.
- **Contraindications:** Bowel obstruction, acute abdominal conditions, inflammatory bowel disease.
- **Drug Interactions:** Antibiotics, diuretics, corticosteroids, cardiac glycosides.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Limited data in pregnancy; generally safe during breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 5-10 mg orally daily; Children: dose by weight/age.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Bowel movements, electrolyte levels (in high-risk patients).

## **Popular Combinations**

- Magnesium citrate (e.g., Picolax):  Combines stimulant and osmotic laxative effects for enhanced bowel cleansing.
- Magnesium oxide and anhydrous citric acid (e.g., Prepopik, Clenpiq): Used for bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess for contraindications, electrolyte imbalances, and dehydration.
- **Specific Populations:** See "Dosage - Special Cases" and "Pregnancy and Breastfeeding."
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Encourage adequate fluid intake to prevent dehydration. May cause dizziness or syncope; caution with driving or operating machinery.
