      dose should be skipped, and the regular dosing schedule should be
      resumed.  Doubling up on doses is not recommended.

## **Usage**

- Sodium stibogluconate is prescribed for the treatment of leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease transmitted by sandflies. This includes cutaneous (skin), visceral (internal organs), and mucosal (mucous membranes) forms of the disease.  It has also been investigated for use in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
- **Pharmacological classification:** Antiprotozoal agent, pentavalent antimonial.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  While the exact mechanism isn't fully elucidated, sodium stibogluconate is believed to inhibit the parasite's essential metabolic processes, including glucose metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. This disrupts crucial cellular functions like DNA and RNA synthesis, leading to parasite death. The drug targets the amastigote form of the Leishmania parasite residing within macrophages.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:** Pentostam, Stiboson.
- **Brand Names:** Pentostam.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Sodium stibogluconate primarily affects  Leishmania parasites. It inhibits several metabolic pathways crucial for the parasite's survival and replication. By targeting these pathways, it ultimately leads to parasite death.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). Its absorption following IM administration may be slower than IV. It's primarily excreted via the kidneys.  The drug is not extensively metabolized. Elimination is relatively slow.
- **Mode of Action:** The drug's antileishmanial action is thought to involve inhibition of trypanothione reductase, a crucial enzyme for the parasite's antioxidant defense. This leads to the build-up of toxic byproducts and subsequent parasite death. It specifically targets the amastigote form within macrophages.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Visceral Leishmaniasis:** 20 mg/kg/day (up to a maximum of 850 mg) IV or IM for 20-28 days.
- **Cutaneous Leishmaniasis:** 20 mg/kg/day (up to a maximum of 850 mg) IV or IM for 10-20 days.
- **Mucosal Leishmaniasis:** 20 mg/kg/day (up to a maximum of 850 mg) IV or IM for 30 days.
- Administration should be via slow IV infusion (over at least 5 minutes) or deep IM injection.

#### **Children:**

- Similar to adult dosing (20 mg/kg/day, maximum 850 mg), but for children under 10 kg, a minimum dose of 200 mg daily is recommended. Pediatric safety considerations include careful monitoring for adverse effects due to potential immature organ function.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Caution advised due to potential age-related decline in organ function. Close monitoring is necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Contraindicated in significant renal impairment. Dose adjustment may be required in mild to moderate renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with cardiac disease, especially arrhythmias.  Close cardiac monitoring (ECG) during administration is recommended.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing for specific clinical settings generally follows the standard dosing recommendations for the respective form of leishmaniasis. There is not any specific information related to dosing for Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, and Emergency Situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are primarily based on renal function.  For patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, dose reduction may be necessary.  No specific guidelines are available, and adjustments should be made based on clinical judgment and close patient monitoring.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anorexia, headache, lethargy, myalgia, arthralgia, fever, sweating, flushing, vertigo, epistaxis, gingival bleeding, rash, injection site pain (IV or IM), elevated liver enzymes. ECG changes (e.g., T-wave flattening or inversion, prolonged QT interval).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Pancreatitis, cardiac arrhythmias (including torsades de pointes),  hepatitis, renal failure, bone marrow suppression, anaphylaxis, pneumonia.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic complications from prolonged use are rare but may include cardiac conduction abnormalities.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to sodium stibogluconate or any component of the formulation.
- Significant renal impairment.
- Hepatic impairment.
- Pregnancy.
- Breastfeeding.
- Concurrent use of amphotericin B or other QT-prolonging drugs.

## **Drug Interactions**

- **Amphotericin B:** Increased risk of cardiotoxicity.
- **QT Prolonging Agents:** (e.g., certain antiarrhythmics, antidepressants, antipsychotics, quinolone antibiotics): Increased risk of torsades de pointes and other ventricular arrhythmias.
- **Other Potential Interactions:** While not extensively documented, it is essential to consider potential interactions with other medications metabolized by the liver or excreted by the kidneys.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Information on pregnancy safety is limited. The drug is generally contraindicated during pregnancy due to potential fetal risks.
- **Breastfeeding:** Limited data suggests that small amounts of the drug may be excreted in breast milk.  Breastfeeding is generally contraindicated during treatment.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits parasite metabolic processes, including glucose metabolism and ATP synthesis.
- **Side Effects:** Common: Nausea, vomiting, myalgia, arthralgia, elevated liver enzymes. Serious: Pancreatitis, cardiac arrhythmias, hepatitis.
