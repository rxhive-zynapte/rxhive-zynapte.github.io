## **Usage**

- Sodium Valproate is prescribed for the treatment of various types of epileptic seizures (generalized tonic-clonic, absence, myoclonic, and partial seizures),  bipolar disorder (for managing manic episodes and preventing relapse), and migraine prophylaxis.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Anticonvulsant, mood stabilizer.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Sodium valproate's precise mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve multiple mechanisms including increasing brain levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter,  blocking voltage-gated sodium channels, and affecting potassium channels, thereby reducing neuronal excitability.

## **Alternate Names**

- Valproic acid
- Valproate sodium
- **Brand Names:**
    - Epilim
    - Depakene
    - Depakote
    - Stavzor
    - Convulex


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Sodium valproate exerts its anticonvulsant effect by enhancing GABAergic inhibition in the brain. It also modulates voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels, decreasing neuronal excitability and suppressing seizure activity. In bipolar disorder, it stabilizes mood, potentially by affecting inositol metabolism and modulating intracellular signaling pathways.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Sodium valproate is well-absorbed orally. It is highly protein-bound (primarily to albumin) and metabolized extensively in the liver via glucuronidation and mitochondrial beta-oxidation. It has a relatively short half-life (9-16 hours), requiring multiple daily doses.  Elimination is primarily renal.
- **Mode of Action:** Increases GABA levels, blocks sodium channels, and affects potassium channels, reducing neuronal excitability.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Enhances GABAergic activity, may inhibit GABA transaminase, and modulates sodium and potassium channels.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of metabolites. Some hepatic metabolism via CYP enzymes.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Epilepsy/Bipolar Disorder:**  Initial 600mg daily, increased by 200mg every 3 days until seizure control or mood stabilization is achieved.  Usual maintenance dose: 1000-2000mg daily (20-30 mg/kg/day), up to a maximum of 2500mg/day in divided doses.
- **Migraine Prophylaxis:** 200-400mg twice daily.


#### **Children:**

- **Epilepsy/Bipolar Disorder:** Initial 10-15mg/kg/day, increased by 5-10 mg/kg weekly until optimal response. Maximum 60 mg/kg/day. Use syrup for children under 20 kg. For children over 20kg, start with 400mg daily, irrespective of weight, and increase until control is achieved, typically within the range of 20-30mg/kg body weight per day.
- **Pediatric Safety Considerations:** Monitor liver function, especially in children under 2 years old.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and titrate slowly. Monitor for adverse effects like somnolence, dehydration, and nutritional status.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be necessary. Monitor closely.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in severe liver disease. Use with caution in mild to moderate hepatic impairment and adjust dosage based on clinical monitoring.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider interactions with other medications and adjust dosage accordingly.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:** Intravenous administration may be used if oral administration is not feasible, at 10-15 mg/kg/day, with adjustments as needed. Switch to oral administration as soon as possible.
- **Emergency Situations (e.g., status epilepticus):**  Intravenous administration of 10-15 mg/kg/day, infused slowly over 1 hour. Maximum dose 60mg/kg/day.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjust dosage based on patient response, tolerability, and plasma levels (therapeutic range: 50-100 mcg/mL).
- Consider renal/hepatic function, age, concomitant medications, and other individual factors.

## **Drug Interactions**

- **Enzyme-inducing drugs** (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, rifampicin): Decrease valproate levels.
- **Enzyme-inhibiting drugs** (e.g., felbamate, cimetidine, erythromycin): Increase valproate levels.
- **Salicylates:** Increased risk of hepatotoxicity.
- **Lamotrigine:** Increased risk of lamotrigine-induced rash.
- **Warfarin:** Increased risk of bleeding.
- **Other anticonvulsants:** Alterations in serum levels.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** D (Australia); X (US- for migraine and bipolar disorder);  not assigned (US-for Epilepsy)
- **Fetal Risks:** Neural tube defects (e.g., spina bifida), congenital malformations, developmental delays, lower IQ, autism spectrum disorder.
- **Breastfeeding:** Small amounts are excreted in breast milk.  Monitor infant for potential side effects. If valproate is essential, discuss benefits and risks with the mother.
