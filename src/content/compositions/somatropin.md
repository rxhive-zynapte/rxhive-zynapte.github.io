## **Usage**

Somatropin is a synthetic human growth hormone (hGH) prescribed for various medical conditions related to growth hormone deficiency or insufficiency.  It is a **growth hormone agonist**, classified as an **endocrine agent**.

Somatropin's mechanism of action involves mimicking the effects of naturally occurring hGH, stimulating cell growth and regeneration in various tissues by binding to cell surface receptors specific to growth hormone. This action promotes protein synthesis, increases fat breakdown for energy, and impacts carbohydrate metabolism.


## **Alternate Names**

Somatropin is also known as recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH). Several brand names exist, including but not limited to Genotropin, Humatrope, Norditropin, Omnitrope, Saizen, Serostim, Tev-Tropin, Zorbtive and Zomacton.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Somatropin binds to specific cell surface receptors, primarily on liver cells, leading to the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). IGF-1 mediates many of the growth-promoting effects of somatropin, including bone growth, protein synthesis, and organ growth.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Subcutaneous administration provides slow and sustained absorption.
* **Metabolism:**  Primarily metabolized in the liver and kidneys.
* **Elimination:** Excreted through both renal and hepatic pathways. Specific details on CYP enzyme involvement are limited.

**Mode of Action:** Somatropin interacts with dimerized growth hormone receptors on cell surfaces, activating intracellular signaling pathways that lead to increased gene transcription, protein synthesis, and cell growth.

**Receptor Binding:** Binds to the growth hormone receptor, a transmembrane protein.

**Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Specific enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation is not the primary mechanism of somatropin action.


## **Dosage**

Dosage is highly individualized and should be determined and monitored by a physician experienced in growth hormone therapy. The following are general guidelines, and specific product information should always be consulted:

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Growth Hormone Deficiency:** Initial dose: 0.15-0.3 mg/day subcutaneously.  Titrate upward every 1-2 months based on clinical response and IGF-1 levels. Maintenance doses vary widely between individuals. Women may require higher doses than men.  Patients older than 60, obese individuals, or those with diabetes/glucose intolerance may start with a lower dose (0.1-0.2 mg/day).

#### **Children:**

* **Growth Hormone Deficiency:** 0.16-0.24 mg/kg/week subcutaneously, divided into 6-7 daily doses.
* **Turner Syndrome:** Up to 0.375 mg/kg/week subcutaneously, divided into 3-7 weekly doses.
* **Idiopathic Short Stature:** Up to 0.47 mg/kg/week subcutaneously, divided into 6-7 daily doses.
* **Small for Gestational Age:** Up to 0.48 mg/kg/week subcutaneously, divided into 6-7 daily doses. Recent literature suggests higher initial doses (e.g., 0.067 mg/kg/day) in very short or older/pubertal children. Younger children (less than 4 years old) with less severe short stature may start at a lower dose (0.033 mg/kg/day).
* **Prader-Willi Syndrome:** 0.16-0.24 mg/kg/week subcutaneously, divided into 6-7 daily doses.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start at a lower dose with smaller increments.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments based on renal function may be necessary, but specific guidelines are limited.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments may be needed, but specific guidelines are limited.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Patients with diabetes, glucose intolerance, or obesity may require lower initial doses and careful monitoring.  Dosage adjustments may be required for those on oral estrogen therapy.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Somatropin is not typically used for acute conditions like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its use focuses on long-term growth promotion or hormone replacement.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on individual patient response, including clinical improvement and serum IGF-1 levels.  Consider renal or hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, age, gender, and concomitant medications when modifying dosage.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
* Injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling, itching)
* Headache
* Muscle or joint pain
* Edema
* Carpal tunnel syndrome
* Numbness/tingling in extremities


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
* Intracranial hypertension (papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea, vomiting)
* Pancreatitis (sudden severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting)
* Hypothyroidism
* Hyperglycemia
* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, difficulty breathing)


### **Long-Term Effects:**
* Increased risk of certain cancers
* Glucose intolerance/diabetes
* Musculoskeletal complications


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
* Systemic hypersensitivity reactions



## **Contraindications**

* Active malignancy
* Acute critical illness following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery, multiple trauma, or acute respiratory failure
* Closed epiphyses (in children for growth promotion)
* Active proliferative or severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy
* Prader-Willi syndrome with severe obesity or respiratory impairment
* Hypersensitivity to somatropin or excipients (e.g., benzyl alcohol, metacresol)


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Glucocorticoids:** May attenuate the growth-promoting effects of somatropin.
* **Oral Estrogens:** May reduce the response to somatropin, requiring dose adjustment.
* **Insulin/Oral Hypoglycemics:** May require adjustment due to somatropin's effects on glucose metabolism.
* **Cytochrome P450 Interactions:** While somatropin is primarily metabolized in the liver and kidneys, specific CYP interactions have not been extensively characterized. Consult specific drug information for potential interactions with other medications metabolized by CYP enzymes.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:**  Limited human data. Animal studies have not shown significant adverse developmental effects. Use only if clearly needed.
* **Breastfeeding:**  It is unknown if somatropin is excreted in human milk. While limited data suggest no adverse effects, exercise caution, especially when nursing a newborn or preterm infant.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Mimics endogenous hGH, stimulating cell growth and regeneration via IGF-1.
* **Side Effects:** Injection site reactions, headache, muscle/joint pain, edema, carpal tunnel syndrome, intracranial hypertension, pancreatitis, hypothyroidism, hyperglycemia, allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:**  Active malignancy, acute critical illness, closed epiphyses, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:** Glucocorticoids, oral estrogens, insulin/oral hypoglycemics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Limited human data, use cautiously.
* **Dosage:** Individualized based on age, condition, and response; refer to detailed dosage guidelines.

## **Popular Combinations**

Somatropin is typically used as monotherapy.  Concomitant use of other hormones may be necessary in patients with multiple hormone deficiencies.

* Pre-screening for pre-existing conditions and concomitant medications is crucial.
* Exercise caution in patients with diabetes or a history of glucose intolerance.
* Regular monitoring of growth parameters and IGF-1 levels is essential.
* Rotate injection sites to avoid lipodystrophy.
