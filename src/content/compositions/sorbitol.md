## **Usage**

Sorbitol is primarily indicated for the treatment of occasional constipation.  It acts as an osmotic laxative. It can also be used as a urologic irrigant during transurethral surgical procedures like prostatic resection. Sorbitol is classified as an osmotic laxative, and is also used as a humectant, sweetening agent, and diuretic.

## **Alternate Names**

- D-Sorbitol
- D-Glucitol

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Sorbitol exerts its laxative effect by increasing osmotic pressure within the intestinal lumen. This draws water into the bowel, softening the stool and promoting peristalsis.  When used as an irrigant, it maintains a clear surgical field due to its non-electrolytic and hypotonic properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

- **Absorption:**  Minimally absorbed after oral or rectal administration.
- **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver to fructose.  Patients with fructose intolerance should use sorbitol cautiously.
- **Elimination:**  Unabsorbed sorbitol is excreted in feces.  Metabolized sorbitol is eliminated via the kidneys.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Constipation (Oral):** 30-150 mL of a 70% solution once.
- **Constipation (Rectal):** 120 mL of a 25-30% solution as an enema once.

#### **Children:**

- **Constipation (2-11 years, Oral):** 2 mL/kg of a 70% solution once.
- **Constipation (2-11 years, Rectal):** 30-60 mL of a 25-30% solution as an enema.
- **Constipation (12 years and older):**  Same as adult dose.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution; adequate hydration is essential.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions (Diabetes):**  May cause hyperglycemia. Monitor blood glucose. 

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation:** Not applicable for routine intubation.
- **Surgical Procedures (Transurethral):** 3-3.3% solution as an irrigant.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not typically indicated.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Consider potential for fluid and electrolyte imbalances with larger volumes.
- **Emergency Situations:**  Not indicated.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be needed based on patient response and tolerance.  No specific renal or hepatic dose adjustments are provided.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
- Abdominal discomfort (cramping, bloating, distension)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance (especially with higher doses or prolonged use)
- Hyperglycemia (in patients with diabetes)


### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic use can lead to dependence.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

## **Drug Interactions**

- **Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate (Calcium Polystyrene Sulfonate):** Concurrent use may cause intestinal necrosis â€“ avoid combination.
- **Certain Medications (e.g., those affecting potassium levels):**  Monitor electrolyte levels.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Consult a healthcare professional before use.  Animal studies are lacking, and human data is limited.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Consult a healthcare professional before use. Exercise caution as it is unknown if sorbitol is excreted in breast milk.

- **Side Effects:** Abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, nausea, flatulence. Rarely, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, hyperglycemia.
- **Contraindications:** Anuria, fructose intolerance, appendicitis/intestinal obstruction symptoms.
- **Drug Interactions:** Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (avoid combination).
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult a healthcare professional.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 30-150 mL (70% oral solution) once, 120 mL (25-30% rectal enema) once. Children (2-11 years): 2 mL/kg (70% oral solution) once, 30-60 mL (25-30% rectal enema).
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Fluid and electrolyte balance, especially in vulnerable populations.

## **Popular Combinations**

No specific popular drug combinations for laxative purposes. When given as an adjunct with sodium polystyrene sulfonate, extreme caution is needed.

## **Precautions**
