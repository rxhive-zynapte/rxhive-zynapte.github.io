## **Usage**

Sotalol is prescribed for the treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, and for the maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter.  It's pharmacologically classified as a non-selective beta-blocker with Class III antiarrhythmic properties. Sotalol acts by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors and prolonging the action potential duration of cardiac myocytes, thereby slowing heart rate and conduction velocity.


## **Alternate Names**

Sotalol is the generic name. Brand names include Betapace and Betapace AF.  Sotacor is a brand name for the intravenous formulation.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Sotalol possesses both beta-blocking (Class II) and potassium channel blocking (Class III) antiarrhythmic actions. The L-isomer exhibits primarily beta-blocking activity, while both isomers contribute to the Class III effects. Beta-blockade reduces heart rate, myocardial contractility, and atrioventricular conduction. Class III action prolongs repolarization, increasing the effective refractory period.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Sotalol is well-absorbed orally (bioavailability > 90%) with peak plasma concentrations reached in 2.5 to 4 hours. It's not metabolized by CYP enzymes and is primarily excreted unchanged via the kidneys. The elimination half-life is approximately 12 hours, allowing for twice-daily dosing. Steady-state plasma levels are achieved in 2-3 days. Sotalol doesn't bind significantly to plasma proteins and has a volume of distribution of 1.6 to 2.4 L/kg.

**Mode of Action:** Sotalol exerts its beta-blocking effect by competitively binding to beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors. Its Class III action involves blocking potassium channels, particularly the delayed rectifier potassium current (IK), which prolongs cardiac repolarization.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Initial dose: 80 mg orally twice daily.
Maintenance dose: Adjustable, typically 160-320 mg/day divided twice daily.
Some patients with life-threatening arrhythmias may require up to 480-640 mg/day.
Dose adjustments should be made every 2-3 days to allow for steady-state plasma concentrations and QT interval monitoring.


#### **Children:**

For children aged 2 or older with normal renal function:
Initial dose: 1.2 mg/kg three times daily (3.6 mg/kg total daily dose).
Maximum dose: 2.4 mg/kg three times daily (7.2 mg/kg total daily dose, or maximum 360mg total daily dose).
Dose titration should be based on clinical response, heart rate, and QTc interval, preferably in a hospital setting.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start at the low end of the adult range and monitor closely. Reduce dose to approximately 80% of the usual adult dose based on patient response and changes in vital signs. 
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce the dose based on creatinine clearance. If CrCl is between 40-60 mL/min, administer once daily. If less than 40 mL/min, sotalol is not recommended.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment is necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with diabetes (can mask hypoglycemia), sick sinus syndrome, and other cardiovascular diseases.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing guidelines for these settings are not provided in the available sources.

* **Intubation** 
* **Surgical Procedures**
* **Mechanical Ventilation**
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
* **Emergency Situations** (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest)

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjust dose based on patient's renal function, QTc interval prolongation, and clinical response.  Monitor heart rate, QT interval, and electrolytes during dosage titration.  


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Fatigue, dizziness, bradycardia, hypotension, dyspnea.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Torsades de pointes, new or worsened heart failure, bronchospasm.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

No specific long-term effects are mentioned in the provided sources aside from potential progression of underlying heart conditions.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Torsades de pointes, bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm.


## **Contraindications**

* Sinus bradycardia, second- or third-degree AV block (without a functioning pacemaker).
* Congenital or acquired long QT syndrome.
* Cardiogenic shock.
* Uncompensated heart failure.
* Bronchial asthma or related bronchospastic conditions.
* Hypersensitivity to sotalol.
* Creatinine clearance <40 mL/min.


## **Drug Interactions**

Sotalol interacts with several medications, including:

* Class Ia and Ic antiarrhythmics (increased risk of proarrhythmia).
* Calcium channel blockers (increased risk of bradycardia and hypotension).
* Digoxin (additive bradycardic effect).
* Insulin and oral hypoglycemics (may mask signs of hypoglycemia).
* Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine) (additive beta-blocking effects).


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category: B. While animal studies have shown no evidence of teratogenicity, there's limited human data. Use during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus.  Sotalol is excreted in breast milk, potentially causing bradycardia and hypoglycemia in the neonate. Monitor infants of breastfeeding mothers taking sotalol.
