## **Usage**

Spiramycin is prescribed for the treatment and prevention of various bacterial infections, especially those caused by Gram-positive bacteria. It is also used to prevent *Toxoplasma gondii* infection in pregnant women to minimize the risk of congenital toxoplasmosis.  Its pharmacological classification is antibiotic (macrolide). Spiramycin acts by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. It binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit of bacteria, blocking transpeptidation or translocation reactions. This prevents peptide chain elongation, halting bacterial growth (bacteriostatic effect).

## **Alternate Names**

Spiramycin is also known as Rovamycine (a common brand name).  It may also be marketed under other brand names internationally.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Spiramycin exhibits a bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting bacterial growth and reproduction without directly killing the bacteria.  It achieves this primarily by suppressing protein synthesis within the bacterial cell.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Oral absorption is incomplete but improves when taken with food.  Peak plasma concentrations are reached within 1.5 to 3 hours. Rectal absorption is observed with suppositories. Intravenous administration provides direct delivery into the bloodstream.
* **Distribution:** Spiramycin is widely distributed into body tissues, including the placenta, and is present in breast milk. It has low protein binding (10-25%).
* **Metabolism:** Metabolized in the liver to active metabolites.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated through the fecal-biliary route (80%) and secondarily through renal excretion.  Enterohepatic recycling may occur. Elimination half-life ranges from 4.5 to 13.5 hours, increasing with age.

**Mode of Action:** Spiramycin reversibly binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria, blocking transpeptidation or translocation reactions, thus inhibiting protein synthesis and impeding bacterial growth.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral:** 1-2 grams (3-6 million IU) twice daily, or 500mg - 1g (1.5 - 3 million IU) three times a day. For severe infections, 2-2.5 grams (6-7.5 million IU) twice daily.
* **Intravenous:** 500 mg (1.5 million IU) every 8 hours.  For severe infections, 1 gram (3 million IU) every 8 hours.
* **Rectal:** Two or three 750 mg (1.95 million IU) suppositories daily.


#### **Children:**

* **Oral:** For children â‰¥20 kg: 25 mg/kg twice daily, or 17 mg/kg three times daily. For congenital toxoplasmosis, specific dosing regimens exist (refer to detailed resources like WikEM).
* **Intravenous:** Dosage determined by the physician.
* **Rectal:** For children up to 12 years: Two or three 500 mg (1.3 million IU) suppositories daily.  Newborns: 250 mg (650,000 IU) per 5 kg body weight, once daily.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary due to age-related changes in hepatic and renal function. Monitor for potential QT prolongation.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is typically required due to minimal renal excretion.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution, as spiramycin is metabolized in the liver. Monitor liver function tests (LFTs).
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use cautiously in patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions, particularly those at risk for QT prolongation.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Spiramycin is generally not indicated for routine use in scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or general ICU use.  Its use is primarily focused on treating specific infections, particularly in pregnant women for toxoplasmosis prevention.  Emergency use is limited.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on individual patient factors, including renal or hepatic impairment, other medical conditions, and concomitant medications.  For severe infections, higher doses may be necessary.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, skin rash, itching, hives.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Allergic reactions (angioedema, anaphylaxis), pseudomembranous colitis, transient paresthesia, liver dysfunction (cholestatic hepatitis, jaundice), cardiac arrhythmias (QT prolongation).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic complications from prolonged spiramycin use are rare.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe allergic reactions, severe liver injury, QT prolongation requiring immediate medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to spiramycin or other macrolides. Meningitis (spiramycin doesn't reach therapeutic levels in cerebrospinal fluid).  Use with caution in severe liver or kidney disease.

## **Drug Interactions**

Spiramycin interacts with various drugs, including:

* **Carbidopa/Levodopa:** Decreased levodopa plasma levels.
* **Hormonal Contraceptives:** Reduced efficacy of birth control pills.
* **CYP3A4 substrates:** Increased serum concentrations of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., some statins, ergot alkaloids, benzodiazepines).
* **Drugs that prolong QT interval:** Increased risk of arrhythmias (e.g., amiodarone, quinidine, some antipsychotics).
* **Warfarin:** Altered anticoagulant effects.
* **Rifampin:** Decreased spiramycin efficacy.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Generally considered safe during pregnancy for toxoplasmosis prevention, but use requires careful risk-benefit assessment by the physician. Spiramycin is present in breast milk; use during breastfeeding is generally not recommended unless the benefits outweigh the potential risks to the infant.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rash, allergic reactions (rarely severe), QT prolongation.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to macrolides, meningitis.
* **Drug Interactions:** Carbidopa/levodopa, hormonal contraceptives, CYP3A4 substrates, drugs that prolong the QT interval.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe during pregnancy for toxoplasmosis prevention; not recommended during breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** Refer to detailed dosage section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests (LFTs), especially in patients with pre-existing liver disease or during prolonged use. ECG monitoring in patients at risk for QT prolongation.

## **Popular Combinations**

Spiramycin is often used in combination with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine (with folinic acid) for the treatment of congenital toxoplasmosis, especially in cases where the fetus is infected.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess for allergies, liver/kidney function, and concomitant medications.
* **Specific Populations:** Careful assessment of risk/benefit in pregnant and breastfeeding women, children, and the elderly.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid alcohol if it exacerbates gastrointestinal side effects. Monitor for dizziness, which might impair driving ability.
