## **Usage**

Stabilized oxychloro complex (SOC), also known as Purite®, is primarily used as a preservative in ophthalmic solutions.  It is not a medication itself but is included in formulations to prevent microbial contamination and prolong the shelf life of multi-dose eye drops. It is found in various eye drops prescribed for conditions like glaucoma, ocular hypertension, and dry eye.  It does not have a pharmacological classification in the traditional sense (like antibiotic or analgesic) because it is not intended for therapeutic effect.

## **Alternate Names**

* Purite®
* Stabilized oxychloro complex (SOC)

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Stabilized oxychloro complex exerts its preservative effect through oxidative processes. The exact mechanism is not fully elucidated, but it is thought to involve disruption of microbial cell membranes and interference with essential cellular functions, leading to microbial death.  Its primary action is localized within the eye drop solution and on the ocular surface. Systemic absorption is minimal, resulting in negligible systemic effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Due to its minimal systemic absorption, detailed pharmacokinetic parameters (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) are not typically measured or relevant for stabilized oxychloro complex as a preservative.

## **Dosage**

Stabilized oxychloro complex, being a preservative, does not have a specific dosage. Its concentration in ophthalmic solutions is determined by the manufacturer to ensure adequate preservation of the active ingredient(s) in the eye drops.  The dosage of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in the eye drops is determined independently of the preservative. Always follow the prescribed dosage for the specific eye drop product.

### **Standard Dosage**

The dosage is determined by the active ingredient in the ophthalmic solution.  Refer to the specific medication's prescribing information for details. Stabilized oxychloro complex is present only in low concentrations as a preservative and does not contribute to the therapeutic dose.

#### **Adults:**  Dosage depends on the active ingredient in the formulation.

#### **Children:** Dosage depends on the active ingredient in the formulation. Safety and efficacy have not been established for all ophthalmic solutions containing stabilized oxychloro complex in children below 18 years old.

#### **Special Cases:**

Dosage adjustments in special populations (elderly, renal/hepatic impairment, comorbid conditions) are determined by the active ingredient in the formulation, not the preservative.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The clinical use cases are determined by the active ingredient in the ophthalmic solution.  Stabilized oxychloro is present as a preservative.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on the active ingredient in the eye drops, not the preservative.

## **Side Effects**

Stabilized oxychloro complex is generally well-tolerated. However, some individuals may experience:

### **Common Side Effects**

* Transient ocular irritation (burning, stinging)
* Blurred vision immediately after instillation (usually resolves quickly)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Allergic reactions (eyelid swelling, itching, redness) - discontinue use and seek medical attention if these occur

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term effects of stabilized oxychloro complex as a preservative are not well-established, but chronic use is generally considered safe given its minimal systemic absorption.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs are rare.  Allergic reactions require immediate discontinuation of the product and appropriate management.

## **Contraindications**

* Known hypersensitivity to stabilized oxychloro complex

## **Drug Interactions**

No significant drug interactions are expected with stabilized oxychloro complex itself. However, always consider potential interactions related to the active ingredient(s) in the specific ophthalmic solution.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Limited data is available on the use of stabilized oxychloro complex during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  Consult with a healthcare professional before using eye drops containing this preservative during these periods. The safety profile of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in the eye drop needs to be evaluated.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Antimicrobial preservative through oxidative processes.
* **Side Effects:** Transient ocular irritation, rare allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:** Generally, none expected from the preservative. Check specific eye drop formulation.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Limited data; consider risk-benefit ratio.
* **Dosage:** Determined by the active ingredient in the ophthalmic solution, not the preservative.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Primarily observe for local ocular irritation or signs of allergic reactions.

## **Popular Combinations**

Stabilized oxychloro complex is used as a preservative in ophthalmic solutions with various active ingredients. Examples include brimonidine tartrate for glaucoma and nepafenac for post-cataract surgery pain and inflammation.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Screen for known allergies to SOC. Exercise caution in individuals with a history of ocular sensitivities.
