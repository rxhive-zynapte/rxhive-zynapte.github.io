# Standard Cobra Venom (Anti-Snake Venom Serum)

## **Usage**

Standard Cobra Venom, more accurately referred to as **Anti-snake Venom Serum (ASV)** or **Snake Venom Antiserum**, is specifically indicated for the treatment of envenomation resulting from bites by certain venomous snakes, notably the Indian cobra ( *Naja naja*), common krait (*Bungarus caeruleus*), Russell's viper (*Vipera russelli*), and saw-scaled viper (*Echis carinatus*).  It is *not* used for venom from other snake species and should not be given prophylactically. It falls under the pharmacological classification of **antivenom** or **antitoxin**.  The mechanism of action involves neutralizing venom toxins by binding to venom components, thereby inhibiting their toxic effects on the body.

## **Alternate Names**

- Anti-snake Venom Serum (ASV)
- Snake Venom Antiserum
- Polyvalent Anti-snake Venom Serum
- Antivenin

Brand names can vary depending on the manufacturer (e.g., Bharat Serums).

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** ASV contains antibodies that specifically target and neutralize various venom components. This neutralization prevents the venom's toxic effects on the body's physiological systems, including the nervous system, cardiovascular system, and blood clotting cascade.

**Pharmacokinetics:** ASV is administered intravenously, ensuring rapid distribution within the intravascular compartment. Its elimination half-life varies based on the specific antivenom preparation. It primarily works by binding to and neutralizing venom already present in the victim's bloodstream and tissues.

**Mode of action:**  The antibodies in ASV directly bind to venom toxins. This binding inhibits the interaction of the toxins with their target receptors, enzymes, or other molecules in the body. For example, the venom from some snakes like the cobra has neurotoxic components, which cause a presynaptic neuromuscular blockade, potentially leading to respiratory paralysis. ASV can block this neuromuscular blockade.

**Elimination pathways:** The elimination pathways of the venom-antibody complexes are not fully elucidated, but it is likely that they are cleared through the reticuloendothelial system (RES), including the liver and spleen.


## **Dosage**

Dosage is determined by the severity of envenomation, not by patient age or weight, though children and smaller adults (under 40kg) might require up to 50% higher doses.

### **Standard Dosage**

The initial dose is typically 4â€“6 vials (some sources suggest 10), each vial often reconstituted with 10 ml of saline, diluted in 10 ml/kg of 0.9% saline or 5% dextrose, and infused over 1 hour. Close patient monitoring is crucial. An initial dose may range from 4-12 vials, or even up to 20 or more based on clinical judgment and degree of envenomation. Additional doses are administered as needed based on continued symptoms and lab findings such as clotting times.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations across various clinical settings (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations) all follow the same basic principles of ASV administration as described in the Standard Dosage section. Dosage depends on the severity of envenomation, with careful monitoring and repeated dosing as needed.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be necessary based on the patient's response to treatment, the ongoing presence of venom effects and clinical judgement. Recurrence of symptoms may warrant additional doses. Renal or hepatic impairment is not usually considered for ASV dose adjustments. ASV use prioritizes the immediate life-threatening effects of venom.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Pyrexia (fever)
- Chills
- Rash, itching
- Local injection site reactions (pain, swelling, redness)
- Headache
- Muscle aches (myalgia)
- Abdominal pain
- Diarrhea


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction): Requires immediate management with adrenaline, antihistamines, and corticosteroids.
- Serum sickness (delayed hypersensitivity reaction): May manifest days to weeks after administration.


### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term effects are rare, but serum sickness is a possibility.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Any hypersensitivity reactions require immediate intervention with adrenaline, antihistamines, and corticosteroids.


## **Contraindications**

The only absolute contraindication to ASV is a known hypersensitivity to the antiserum (usually horse-derived), although the benefits of treating a life-threatening snakebite typically outweigh any potential risk in a true emergency where symptoms are severe.


## **Drug Interactions**

No specific drug interactions are well documented. However, concurrent use of other medications should be carefully evaluated and adjusted based on the patient's condition. The potential for interactions with beta-blockers and opioids has been raised.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

ASV should be administered if the benefits of treating a life-threatening snakebite outweigh potential risks to the fetus or neonate. The decision to administer ASV during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the severity of the envenomation and the potential risks and benefits for both the mother and child.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

See above sections for detailed information on the mechanism of action, side effects, contraindications, drug interactions, pregnancy & breastfeeding, dosage, and monitoring parameters.

## **Popular Combinations**

No specific drug combinations are routinely recommended with ASV. Supportive care is paramount and may include intravenous fluids, pain management, and respiratory support.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Sensitivity testing may be performed but is not always feasible or advisable to wait for results in emergency situations.  Anaphylactic reactions can occur, even with a negative sensitivity test. 

- **Specific Populations:** ASV should be used with caution in pregnant and breastfeeding women due to potential risks.  Pediatric and elderly patients may require dose adjustments.
