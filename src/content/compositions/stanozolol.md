      How does Stanozolol work in hereditary angioedema?**

      **A:** It reduces the frequency and severity of angioedema attacks by
      decreasing the activity or production of bradykinin, thus reducing
      inflammation and vascular permeability.

## **Usage**

- Stanozolol is primarily prescribed for the treatment of hereditary angioedema, a genetic condition characterized by episodes of severe swelling in the face, limbs, airway, and gastrointestinal tract. It is also used to treat certain types of anemia, osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, and problems related to Behcet's disease.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Anabolic steroid, synthetic derivative of testosterone.
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Stanozolol reduces the frequency and severity of angioedema attacks by decreasing the production or activity of bradykinin, a peptide that promotes inflammation and vascular permeability.  It also increases protein synthesis and reduces protein breakdown, leading to increased muscle mass and bone tissue growth.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:** Winstrol (brand name)
- **Brand Names:** Winstrol, Stromba

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Stanozolol binds to androgen receptors, promoting the expression of genes involved in protein synthesis. It reduces the production or effects of bradykinin, decreasing vascular permeability and inflammation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Well-absorbed orally and via intramuscular injection.
    - **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated via renal excretion (90%) with a small amount excreted in feces (6%).
- **Mode of Action:** Binds to androgen receptors, leading to increased protein synthesis and decreased protein catabolism. In hereditary angioedema, it reduces the effects of bradykinin.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Binds to androgen receptors. May inhibit the production or activity of bradykinin.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism followed by renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Angioedema:** Initial: 2 mg orally three times a day. Maintenance: 2 mg daily or on alternate days, or 2.5 mg three times weekly.  Dosages may be adjusted as needed based on response and tolerability.

#### **Children:**

- Limited data available.  Doses between 1-2 mg daily based on age and weight have been suggested, under strict medical supervision. Pediatric use requires careful monitoring of growth and development due to the potential for premature epiphyseal closure.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to increased risk of adverse effects. Dose adjustments may be required.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution advised. Close monitoring and possible dose adjustments may be required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment. Use with caution in mild to moderate impairment with close monitoring of liver function. Dosage adjustments or alternative therapies may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease):** Close monitoring required due to potential for drug interactions and exacerbation of existing conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  Stanozolol is not typically used in the clinical settings listed.  Its primary indication is the treatment and prophylaxis of hereditary angioedema.


### **Dosage Adjustments:** Dosages should be individualized based on patient response, tolerance, and clinical condition, including renal/hepatic function and the presence of comorbid conditions.
