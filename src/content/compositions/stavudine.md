## **Usage**

- Stavudine is an antiviral medication used in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. It is not a cure for HIV or AIDS, but helps to slow the progression of the disease.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Stavudine is a thymidine nucleoside analog. After intracellular phosphorylation to its active triphosphate form, stavudine inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase by competing with the natural substrate, thymidine triphosphate.  Additionally, it incorporates into viral DNA, causing chain termination and inhibiting viral DNA synthesis.

## **Alternate Names**

- d4T
- 2',3'-didehydro-3'-deoxythymidine
- **Brand Name:** Zerit, Zerit XR

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Stavudine reduces HIV viral load by inhibiting reverse transcriptase and disrupting viral DNA synthesis.  This helps to preserve immune function and delay the onset of AIDS-related complications.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Stavudine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with high bioavailability (82-99%). Food may delay absorption but does not significantly affect overall exposure.
    - **Metabolism:** Stavudine is phosphorylated intracellularly to its active triphosphate metabolite.  It does not undergo extensive hepatic metabolism by CYP450 enzymes.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion (approximately 40% as unchanged drug). Dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

-  30 mg orally every 12 hours, regardless of body weight.


#### **Children:**

- **Neonates (birth to 13 days old):** 0.5 mg/kg orally every 12 hours.
- **Infants and Children (14 days old and older, weighing less than 30 kg):** 1 mg/kg orally every 12 hours.
- **Adolescents (weighing 30 kg or more):** 30 mg orally every 12 hours.
- **Pediatric Safety Considerations:** Close monitoring for adverse effects, particularly mitochondrial toxicity and peripheral neuropathy, is essential in pediatric patients.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Age-related renal impairment may necessitate dose adjustments.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose reduction is necessary based on creatinine clearance (CrCl):  
    - CrCl â‰¤ 50 mL/min: 15-20 mg every 12 hours depending on body weight.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Close monitoring is advised, although specific dose adjustments are not typically required. 
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised for patients with liver disease, pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy, or bone marrow suppression.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Stavudine is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary indication is chronic HIV infection management.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are primarily based on renal function. Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism have not been extensively studied.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

- Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling, burning pain in hands or feet)
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
- Headache
- Rash
- Fatigue

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Lactic acidosis
- Hepatomegaly with steatosis (fatty liver)
- Pancreatitis
- Lipoatrophy (loss of body fat, especially in face, arms, and legs)


### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Lipoatrophy
- Peripheral neuropathy
- Mitochondrial toxicity

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Lactic acidosis
- Severe hepatomegaly with steatosis
- Pancreatitis

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to stavudine
- Coadministration with didanosine

## **Drug Interactions**

- **Didanosine:** Contraindicated due to increased risk of pancreatitis, lactic acidosis, peripheral neuropathy, and hepatic dysfunction.
- **Zidovudine:**  May decrease stavudine phosphorylation and activation.
- **Hydroxyurea:** Increased risk of hepatic toxicity.
- **Doxorubicin, Ribavirin:** May inhibit stavudine activation.
- **Drugs causing peripheral neuropathy (e.g., isoniazid, vincristine):** Increased risk of additive neurotoxicity.
- Numerous other drug interactions exist; consultation with a drug interaction checker is recommended.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C. Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk.  A pregnancy exposure registry is available.
- **Fetal Risks:** Potential for mitochondrial dysfunction, although no definitive evidence of teratogenicity.
- **Breastfeeding:** Stavudine is excreted in breast milk. Mothers with HIV should not breastfeed to avoid HIV transmission and potential neonatal side effects.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; inhibits viral replication by competing with natural substrate and causing DNA chain termination.
- **Side Effects:** Peripheral neuropathy, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, rash, lactic acidosis, hepatomegaly, pancreatitis, lipoatrophy.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, coadministration with didanosine.
- **Drug Interactions:** Didanosine, zidovudine, hydroxyurea, doxorubicin, ribavirin, and others.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Category C; not recommended for breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** 30 mg twice daily. Dosage adjustments for renal impairment.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** HIV viral load, CD4 cell count, liver function tests, renal function, signs of peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis, and lactic acidosis.

## **Popular Combinations**

Stavudine is no longer commonly used in combination regimens due to its toxicity profile.  Contemporary HIV treatment guidelines recommend alternative NRTIs with better safety profiles.

## **Precautions**

- Pre-screening for renal and hepatic function, history of peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis is essential.
- Monitor for signs of lactic acidosis, hepatic dysfunction, and peripheral neuropathy throughout treatment.
- Alcohol should be avoided due to the risk of pancreatitis and peripheral neuropathy.
