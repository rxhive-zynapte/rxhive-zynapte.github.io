## **Usage**

Stearyl alcohol is primarily used as an emollient, emulsifier, and thickening agent in various cosmetic and personal care products, including skin creams, lotions, ointments, hair conditioners, and shampoos. It is not classified as a "drug" in the conventional sense, meaning it does not have a specific pharmacological classification like antibiotic or analgesic. Its primary function is to improve the texture, stability, and spreadability of topical formulations. It also helps to hydrate and soften the skin by forming a protective barrier that prevents water loss. It is not prescribed for treating medical conditions.

## **Alternate Names**

- 1-Octadecanol
- Octadecan-1-ol
- Octadecyl alcohol
- (C16-C18) Alkyl alcohol
- Cetostearyl alcohol (when mixed with Cetyl alcohol)
- UniOX A

Stearyl alcohol is not typically marketed under specific brand names; it is listed as an ingredient in many cosmetic products.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Stearyl alcohol acts topically by forming a protective layer on the skin's surface, reducing water loss and increasing skin hydration. It softens and smooths the skin and can improve the texture of cosmetic products. It does not have any systemic pharmacological effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:** When applied topically, stearyl alcohol is poorly absorbed through the skin. The small amount that may be absorbed is metabolized and eliminated without any known significant systemic effects.  It does not bind to receptors, inhibit enzymes, or modulate neurotransmitters.

## **Dosage**

Stearyl alcohol is used in cosmetic formulations in varying concentrations, typically between 0.5% and 20%. The exact amount depends on the desired effect and the specific product.  There are no standard dosage guidelines for stearyl alcohol as a standalone ingredient.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Stearyl alcohol is generally considered safe for topical use. However, in some individuals with sensitive skin, it may cause mild and temporary skin irritation, redness, or itching. Allergic contact dermatitis, although rare, has also been reported.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

No serious side effects have been associated with the topical use of stearyl alcohol.

## **Contraindications**

The primary contraindication for stearyl alcohol is a known hypersensitivity or allergy to the ingredient. Individuals who have experienced allergic reactions to stearyl alcohol or similar fatty alcohols should avoid products containing it.

## **Drug Interactions**

Stearyl alcohol has no known clinically significant drug interactions.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Topical use of stearyl alcohol is generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  However, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional before using any new products during these periods, especially if there is a history of sensitive skin or allergies.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

**Mechanism of Action:**  Emollient, emulsifier, thickener; creates a protective barrier on the skin, reducing water loss and improving hydration.

**Side Effects:** Mild skin irritation, redness, or itching in some individuals.

**Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to stearyl alcohol.
