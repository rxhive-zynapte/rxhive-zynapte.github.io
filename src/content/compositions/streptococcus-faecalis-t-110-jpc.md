## **Usage**

- Streptococcus faecalis T-110 JPC is primarily prescribed for managing gastrointestinal disorders, including diarrhea (traveler's, infantile, antibiotic-induced, and *Clostridium difficile*-associated), gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and *Helicobacter pylori* eradication.  It also aids in the treatment of dysbacteriosis and helps reduce symptoms in lactose-intolerant patients.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Probiotic
- **Mechanism of Action:**  S. faecalis T-110 JPC, a probiotic strain, works synergistically with other probiotics to restore and maintain a healthy balance of gut flora. It assists in breaking down complex carbohydrates and supports the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. It produces lactic acid, which helps maintain gut pH, creating an environment that suppresses the growth of harmful bacteria. This strain stimulates the immune system.

## **Alternate Names**

- *Enterococcus faecalis* T-110 JPC
- *Streptococcus faecalis* T110 JPC (variant spelling)
- This strain is often found in combination probiotic products containing *Clostridium butyricum*, *Bacillus mesentericus*, and *Lactobacillus sporogenes*. Brand names include products such as Bifilac and Cronogut.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  S. faecalis T-110 JPC exerts its effects by modulating the gut flora composition.  It produces lactic acid, leading to an acidic environment that inhibits the growth of certain pathogenic bacteria. It supports the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, improving digestion and nutrient absorption. It also stimulates the immune system.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** As this is a live bacterial strain, its pharmacokinetics is different from traditional drugs. It is administered orally, usually as part of a combination product. While some metabolic activity can occur within the gastrointestinal tract, including breakdown of carbohydrates and production of lactic acid, minimal systemic absorption of the intact bacteria is expected. The primary mechanism of action is local within the gut. Elimination is primarily through fecal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** S. faecalis T-110 JPC adheres to the intestinal lining and competes with pathogenic bacteria for resources and attachment sites.  The production of lactic acid lowers gut pH, inhibiting the growth of pathogens. It does not have specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation effects like traditional drugs.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Dosage varies depending on the specific product formulation.  

#### **Children:** Dosage should be determined by a pediatrician.

#### **Special Cases:** Due to limited information, dosage adjustment for elderly patients, patients with renal/hepatic impairment, and those with comorbid conditions should be made at the physician's discretion.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Information regarding specific dosages in clinical situations (intubation, surgery, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations) is not available.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage modifications are based on individual patient factors and specific product formulation.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Gas
- Bloating
- Abdominal discomfort
- Nausea
- Loss of appetite
- Constipation
- Diarrhea
- Flatulence


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Infections (particularly in immunocompromised individuals)

### **Long-Term Effects**

No specific long-term adverse effects have been reported.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe allergic reactions (rare)

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to any component of the product

## **Drug Interactions**

- Antibiotics: Concurrent use may reduce the effectiveness of both the antibiotic and the probiotic. It's generally recommended to administer probiotics at least two hours before or after antibiotics.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

The safety of S. faecalis T-110 JPC during pregnancy and breastfeeding has not been fully established. Consultation with a physician is recommended before use.  While GBS is a concern during pregnancy and breastfeeding, S. faecalis T-110 JPC is a different strain and is generally considered safe, but caution should be taken. 

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Probiotic; modulates gut flora, produces lactic acid, and stimulates the immune system.
