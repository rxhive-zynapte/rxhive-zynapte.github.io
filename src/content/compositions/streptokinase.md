## **Usage**

Streptokinase is a thrombolytic agent prescribed for the management of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and arterial thromboembolism. It's also used to clear thrombosed arteriovenous cannulae.  It belongs to the pharmacological classification of fibrinolytic agents, specifically thrombolytics, also known as "clot busters."  Streptokinase works by activating plasminogen, a precursor of the enzyme plasmin. Plasmin then degrades fibrin, the primary component of blood clots, thereby dissolving existing clots and preventing new clot formation.

## **Alternate Names**

The generic name is streptokinase. A former brand name was Streptase, which is no longer available in the U.S.  However, generic versions may be available.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Streptokinase binds to plasminogen, forming a complex that converts other plasminogen molecules into plasmin. Plasmin, a serine protease, breaks down fibrin, leading to thrombolysis.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Streptokinase is administered intravenously. Due to its bacterial protein origin, it can trigger antibody formation, requiring a loading dose. It is primarily cleared by the liver with no identified metabolites. The half-life is variable, about 23 minutes, affected by the presence of anti-streptococcal antibodies. Elimination pathways involve hepatic clearance.

**Mode of Action:** Streptokinase forms a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with plasminogen. This complex catalytically converts other plasminogen molecules to plasmin. Plasmin then acts on fibrin, dissolving the clot. This process occurs systemically, affecting both fibrin and fibrinogen, resulting in a generalized lytic state.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Streptokinase primarily functions through enzymatic activation of plasminogen, not through receptor binding or neurotransmitter modulation. It effectively indirectly promotes enzyme activity (plasmin).

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **AMI:** 1.5 million IU IV infusion over 60 minutes.
* **DVT/PE:**  250,000 IU IV bolus over 30 minutes, followed by 100,000 IU/hour for 72 hours (DVT) or as indicated (PE).
* **Arterial Thromboembolism:** Regimen varies depending on location and severity; consult specific guidelines.
* **Arteriovenous Cannula Occlusion:** 250,000 IU in each cannula limb over 25-35 minutes.

#### **Children:**

Limited data exists for pediatric use; dosing is based on weight and the specific clinical scenario.  Safety and efficacy have not been established for children under 18. Consider consulting with a pediatric specialist.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** While effective, monitor for bleeding complications.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments based on creatinine clearance are not explicitly defined; monitor renal function and clotting parameters.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific dosage adjustments; careful monitoring for bleeding complications.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized dosing based on risk-benefit assessment, especially in patients with recent surgery/trauma, bleeding disorders, or cerebrovascular disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage guidelines are similar to the standard adult dosing. Clinical use cases include:
* Intubation (for cannula occlusion): As above
* Surgical Procedures (post-op DVT prevention): As above
* Mechanical Ventilation (for cannula occlusion): As above
* Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use (for various thrombotic complications): As above
* Emergency Situations (AMI, PE): As above

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Individualized dosing is necessary, considering renal and hepatic function, comorbid conditions, and concomitant medications. Closely monitor coagulation parameters (e.g., aPTT, PT, INR, fibrinogen).

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Bleeding (at injection site, gums, wounds), bruising, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, fever, allergic reactions (rash, itching).

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Intracranial hemorrhage, stroke, major bleeding (GI, GU), anaphylaxis.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

No specific long-term side effects directly attributed to streptokinase itself have been established. However, sequelae from bleeding events or the underlying condition treated with streptokinase may contribute to long-term health implications.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Major bleeding, allergic reactions requiring immediate intervention, including anaphylaxis, and stroke.

## **Contraindications**

* **Absolute:** Active internal bleeding, recent intracranial/intraspinal surgery, history of intracranial hemorrhage, aortic dissection, severe hypertension, known intracranial neoplasm.
* **Relative:** Pregnancy, recent surgery/trauma, history of stroke, active peptic ulcer, severe liver disease.

## **Drug Interactions**

Anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin), antiplatelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel) increase bleeding risk.  Aminocaproic acid reverses streptokinase's effects.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Category C. Use only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks to the fetus. It's unknown if streptokinase is excreted in breast milk; consider discontinuing breastfeeding during treatment and for 24 hours after the last dose.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Activates plasminogen to form plasmin, which degrades fibrin.
* **Side Effects:** Bleeding, bruising, hypotension, fever, allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Active bleeding, recent intracranial events, history of intracranial hemorrhage.
* **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category C; use with caution.
* **Dosage:** See detailed section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** aPTT, PT, INR, fibrinogen, Hgb, Hct, platelet count, signs of bleeding.

## **Popular Combinations**

Often used in conjunction with heparin after the initial streptokinase treatment, though this increases bleeding risk.

## **Precautions**

Screen for contraindications, including recent bleeding or trauma, intracranial abnormalities, and hypersensitivity to streptokinase. Monitor vital signs and signs of bleeding during and after administration. Avoid invasive procedures during and shortly after treatment.
