## **Usage**

- Succinylcholine chloride is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent indicated as an adjunct to general anesthesia to facilitate tracheal intubation and provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation. It is also used in other procedures requiring brief relaxation such as endoscopy, orthopedic manipulations, and electroconvulsive therapy.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Neuromuscular Blocking Agent, Depolarizing Muscle Relaxant.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Succinylcholine acts as an acetylcholine receptor agonist at the neuromuscular junction.  It initially depolarizes the motor end-plate, causing transient muscle fasciculations.  The persistent depolarization then prevents further muscle contraction, leading to flaccid paralysis.


## **Alternate Names**

- Suxamethonium Chloride
- Suxamethonium
- Succinylcholine
-  Sucostrin
- Scoline
- Anectine
- Quelicin


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Succinylcholine depolarizes the motor end-plate at the neuromuscular junction, mimicking the action of acetylcholine but with a much longer duration. This sustained depolarization renders the postsynaptic membrane unresponsive to further stimulation by acetylcholine, resulting in flaccid paralysis.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Primarily administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). IV administration results in rapid onset of action (within 1 minute). IM administration has a slower onset (2-3 minutes).
    - **Metabolism:** Rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma pseudocholinesterase (butyrylcholinesterase), an enzyme distinct from acetylcholinesterase.
    - **Elimination:**  The metabolites are primarily excreted renally.
- **Mode of Action:** Binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the motor end-plate, causing prolonged depolarization and preventing repolarization, thus blocking neuromuscular transmission.
- **Receptor Binding:** Agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Renal excretion of metabolites.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Intubation/Short Procedures:** 0.6 mg/kg IV (range: 0.3-1.1 mg/kg). Onset is typically within 1 minute, with a duration of 4-6 minutes.
- **Continuous Infusion (Long Procedures):** 2.5-4.3 mg/minute IV. Alternatively, intermittent IV boluses of 0.04-0.07 mg/kg can be given as needed.


#### **Children:**

- **Infants and Small Children:** 2 mg/kg IV (emergency intubation or immediate airway securing).
- **Older Children and Adolescents:** 1 mg/kg IV (emergency intubation or immediate airway securing).
- **IM (if IV access unavailable):** 3-4 mg/kg (maximum 150 mg total dose).


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start at the lower end of the dosing range due to potential for decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Normal single dose can be used in the absence of hyperkalemia. Multiple or larger doses should be avoided.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Plasma cholinesterase levels may be reduced, requiring dosage adjustments.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, asthma, pulmonary impairment, burns, hyperkalemia, malignant hyperthermia, skeletal muscle myopathies, and upper motor neuron injury.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation:** 0.6 mg/kg IV (standard dose), 1.5 mg/kg IV (rapid sequence intubation).
- **Surgical Procedures:** Continuous infusion (2.5-4.3 mg/minute) or intermittent boluses (0.04-0.07 mg/kg).
- **Mechanical Ventilation:**  Dosage adjusted based on patient response and desired level of relaxation.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  Continuous infusion adjusted based on patient need.
- **Emergency Situations:** 1-2 mg/kg IV.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjust dosage based on patient response, duration of procedure, and any underlying medical conditions.
- Renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms affecting pseudocholinesterase activity require careful dose adjustments.
