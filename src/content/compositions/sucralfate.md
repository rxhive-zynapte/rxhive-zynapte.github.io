## **Usage**

Sucralfate is prescribed for the short-term (up to 8 weeks) treatment of active duodenal ulcers. It is also used for maintenance therapy following healing of acute duodenal ulcers to reduce ulcer recurrence. Off-label uses include treatment of gastric ulcers, stress ulcer prophylaxis, treatment of oral ulcerations and dysphagia in patients with epidermolysis bullosa, and treatment of oral complications of chemotherapy in bone marrow transplant recipients.  Sucralfate falls under the **pharmacological classification** of a mucosal protectant. It creates a protective barrier over ulcers, shielding them from stomach acid and other irritants to facilitate healing.

## **Alternate Names**

Sucralfate is also known by its brand name, Carafate. There are no widely recognized international or regional variations of the name.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Sucralfate acts locally in the stomach and duodenum. It selectively binds to the base of ulcers, forming a protective barrier against pepsin, acid, and bile salts, thus promoting ulcer healing.  
**Pharmacokinetics:**  Sucralfate is minimally absorbed systemically, with only small amounts of aluminum hydroxide being absorbed. It is primarily eliminated through the gastrointestinal tract.  
**Mode of Action:**  In the acidic environment of the stomach, sucralfate undergoes cross-linking and polymerization, forming a viscous, sticky paste that adheres to the ulcer surface. This physical barrier shields the ulcer from the damaging effects of acid, pepsin, and bile.  The binding to ulcer proteins is thought to be electrostatic in nature.  
**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Sucralfate does not bind to specific receptors, inhibit enzymes, or modulate neurotransmitters. Its action is primarily physical.  
**Elimination Pathways:**  Sucralfate is mostly eliminated unchanged in the feces. The small amount of aluminum hydroxide absorbed is primarily excreted by the kidneys.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Active Duodenal Ulcer:** 1 g orally four times a day on an empty stomach (1 hour before meals and at bedtime) for 4-8 weeks.
* **Duodenal Ulcer Maintenance:** 1 g orally twice a day.
* **Gastric Ulcer (Off-label):** 1 g orally four times a day.

#### **Children:**

The safety and efficacy in children have not been fully established. Pediatric dosing is determined by the doctor on a case-by-case basis and is considered off-label. Doses ranging from 40-80 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours have been used.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Start at the lower end of the dosing range and titrate as needed, monitoring for adverse effects and renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution. Aluminum accumulation may occur.  Close monitoring of serum aluminum levels is recommended, particularly for patients receiving dialysis.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment is typically necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor blood glucose in patients with diabetes, especially those receiving the oral suspension.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Sucralfate does not have labeled indications for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its use in these settings is limited.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary in patients with renal impairment. If creatinine clearance is less than 30 mL/min, consider reducing the dose and monitoring aluminum levels.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Constipation is the most common side effect.  Diarrhea, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting,  gastric discomfort, indigestion, and flatulence may also occur.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Bezoar formation (especially in patients with underlying conditions or receiving enteral feedings), hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, rash, itching, swelling), and severe allergic reactions (rare).

### **Long-Term Effects**

Aluminum toxicity (including osteomalacia, encephalopathy) is a potential concern with long-term use, especially in patients with renal impairment.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Serious ADRs include bezoar formation, allergic reactions, and aluminum toxicity.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to sucralfate or its components.

## **Drug Interactions**

Sucralfate can reduce the absorption of several medications, including:

* **Antacids:** Administer at least 30 minutes apart.
* **Ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin:** Administer 2 hours apart.
* **Digoxin:** Administer 2 hours apart.
* **Ketoconazole:** Administer 2 hours apart.
* **Levothyroxine:** Administer 2 hours apart.
* **Phenytoin:** Administer 2 hours apart.
* **Tetracycline:** Administer 2 hours apart.
* **Ranitidine:** Administer 2 hours before or 30 minutes after.
* **Furosemide:** May reduce diuretic and antihypertensive effects. Monitor closely.
* **Gemifloxacin:** May decrease gemifloxacin levels.

It is important to note that many medications, particularly those involving metal ions, can have reduced absorption if co-administered with sucralfate.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Sucralfate is classified as Pregnancy Category B (old classification system). It is considered relatively safe to use during pregnancy due to minimal systemic absorption. Limited data exists on breastfeeding, but it is generally considered safe due to minimal absorption.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Forms a protective barrier over ulcers, shielding them from acid and promoting healing.
* **Side Effects:** Constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, nausea.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to sucralfate.
* **Drug Interactions:** Numerous drug interactions due to chelation and reduced absorption. See above for specifics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally considered safe.
* **Dosage:** 1 g four times a day for active duodenal ulcer, 1 g twice daily for maintenance.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function (especially in patients with pre-existing renal disease), serum aluminum levels (long-term use or renal impairment), blood glucose (diabetes).

## **Popular Combinations**

Sucralfate is often used alone.  While antacids can be used for symptom relief, they should be administered at least 30 minutes before or after sucralfate.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Monitor renal function and serum aluminum levels, especially in patients with renal impairment. Monitor blood glucose in diabetic patients.
* **Specific Populations:** Monitor for bezoar formation in patients with delayed gastric emptying or receiving enteral feedings.
