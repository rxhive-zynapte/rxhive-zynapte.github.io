## **Usage**

Sulfamethoxazole is a sulfonamide bacteriostatic antibiotic. It is rarely used alone and is most commonly used in combination with trimethoprim. This combination is effective in treating a wide array of bacterial infections, including urinary tract infections (UTIs), otitis media, bronchitis, shigellosis, traveler's diarrhea, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). It inhibits bacterial growth by interfering with the synthesis of folic acid, a crucial component for bacterial DNA synthesis.


## **Alternate Names**

Sulfamethoxazole is often referred to as SMX or SMZ. When combined with trimethoprim, the combination is known as co-trimoxazole,  TMP-SMX, TMP-SMZ, or TMP-sulfa. Popular brand names include Bactrim and Septra.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Sulfamethoxazole is a sulfonamide that acts by competitively inhibiting dihydropteroate synthase, a bacterial enzyme essential for folic acid synthesis. This inhibition disrupts the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, ultimately hindering bacterial DNA synthesis.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Sulfamethoxazole is well-absorbed orally. It is metabolized in the liver, primarily by N-acetylation, and is excreted mainly by the kidneys.  Its half-life is typically 6-12 hours but increases significantly in renal failure. It can cross the placenta and is found in breast milk.

**Mode of Action:** Sulfamethoxazole competitively binds to dihydropteroate synthase, preventing the incorporation of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) into dihydropteroic acid, an intermediary in the folic acid pathway.

**Elimination pathways:** Sulfamethoxazole is primarily excreted through renal pathways.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **General infections**: 800 mg sulfamethoxazole/160 mg trimethoprim every 12 hours for 10 to 14 days.


#### **Children:**

* **General infections**: Based on body weight. The recommended dosage is 40 mg sulfamethoxazole/8 mg trimethoprim per kg body weight per day divided into two equal doses every 12 hours for 10 days.
* **PCP prophylaxis**:  750 mg sulfamethoxazole/150 mg trimethoprim per mÂ² of body surface area per day divided into two equal doses, administered 3 days a week.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly patients**: Dosage adjustments may be required due to age-related physiological changes. 
* **Renal Impairment**: CrCl 15-30 mL/min: reduce dose by 50%. CrCl <15 mL/min: avoid use.
* **Hepatic Dysfunction**: Dosage adjustments may be required. Closely monitor liver function tests.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim IV administration is generally reserved for cases where oral administration is not feasible.  Dosage should be adjusted according to the patient's condition and renal function. Specific recommendations for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations vary.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are made based on renal function, liver function and patient specific considerations.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and headache.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, bone marrow suppression, acute liver failure, and allergic reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects**
With prolonged use, potential complications may include crystalluria and kidney stones.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Severe skin reactions and hematological abnormalities


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to sulfonamides, megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency, pregnancy at term, and during nursing. Infants less than two months of age should not receive this drug.


## **Drug Interactions**

Sulfamethoxazole can interact with warfarin, phenytoin, methotrexate, and other medications metabolized by the liver. It can potentiate the effects of sulfonylureas and increase the risk of hyperkalemia with ACE inhibitors.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Sulfamethoxazole is contraindicated during pregnancy at term due to the risk of kernicterus in the newborn. It should be used cautiously during other stages of pregnancy. It's also contraindicated during breastfeeding as it can pass into breast milk and potentially harm the infant.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action**: Inhibits dihydropteroate synthase.
* **Side Effects**: Nausea, vomiting, rash, severe skin reactions, and bone marrow suppression.
* **Contraindications**: Sulfonamide hypersensitivity, pregnancy at term, breastfeeding, infants < 2 months old.
* **Drug Interactions**: Warfarin, phenytoin, methotrexate.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding**: Contraindicated.
* **Dosage**: Varies; see above sections.
* **Monitoring Parameters**: Complete blood count, liver and renal function tests.


## **Popular Combinations**

Sulfamethoxazole is most often combined with trimethoprim.


## **Precautions**

Assess renal function before and during treatment. Encourage adequate hydration to prevent crystalluria. Monitor for signs of hypersensitivity and blood dyscrasias.
