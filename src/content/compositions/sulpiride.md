      How does Sulpiride work in the body?**

      **A:**  Sulpiride primarily acts as a dopamine D2 and D3 receptor
      antagonist, primarily in the limbic system and hypothalamus. At lower
      doses, its preferential blockade of presynaptic dopamine receptors can
      increase dopamine turnover. At higher doses, postsynaptic blockade leads
      to antipsychotic effects.

## **Usage**

Sulpiride is prescribed for the treatment of acute and chronic schizophrenia, and short-term symptomatic treatment of anxiety in adults when other therapeutic measures have failed.  Its pharmacological classification is as a typical (first-generation) antipsychotic.  It primarily acts as a dopamine D2 and D3 receptor antagonist,  increasing blood flow in the gastric mucosa and promoting gastrointestinal motility. It also promotes the repair of gastric/duodenal mucosal tissue, making it useful in treating gastric/duodenal ulcers.


## **Alternate Names** 

While "Sulpiride" is the generic name, brand names may vary depending on the region and manufacturer.  Some examples include Sulpiride 200mg Tablets, Sulpiride 200mg Film-Coated Tablets,  Sulpiride Grindeks, Sulpiride STELLA 50 mg, and SULPIRIDE 50 OETHMAAN Capsules. The specific brand names available in India should be confirmed.



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Sulpiride primarily acts as a dopamine D2 and D3 receptor antagonist, particularly in the limbic system and hypothalamus. At lower doses, it preferentially blocks presynaptic dopamine receptors, leading to increased dopamine turnover and potential antidepressant and activating effects.  At higher doses, postsynaptic dopamine receptor blockade predominates, producing antipsychotic effects. Sulpiride also increases prolactin secretion due to its dopamine receptor blockade in the pituitary gland.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Sulpiride is well absorbed orally, with peak plasma concentrations reached within 2-6 hours. Food may slightly reduce its bioavailability.
* **Distribution:**  It distributes widely throughout the body, including the brain, and crosses the placenta. 
* **Metabolism:** Sulpiride undergoes limited hepatic metabolism.
* **Elimination:** It is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine, with a half-life of around 7-9 hours.  Renal impairment necessitates dose adjustments.

**Mode of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**
Sulpiride acts mainly as an antagonist at dopamine D2 and D3 receptors.  At low doses, it preferentially binds to presynaptic D2 autoreceptors, which normally inhibit dopamine release. This can lead to an increase in dopamine synthesis and release, potentially explaining its mood-elevating and activating effects. At higher doses, sulpiride also blocks postsynaptic D2 receptors, resulting in antipsychotic activity by reducing dopaminergic neurotransmission in the mesolimbic pathway.

**Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.



## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**  
#### **Adults:**  

For schizophrenia: 400-800 mg daily, divided into two doses, morning and early evening. Doses can be adjusted based on individual patient response and predominant symptoms. Maximum dose is 1200 mg twice daily. For predominantly negative symptoms, lower doses (200-400 mg twice daily) may be sufficient. For anxiety: 50-150 mg daily for a maximum of 4 weeks.

#### **Children:**  

Not recommended for children under 14 years of age due to insufficient clinical experience.  For children over 14 years: 3-5 mg/kg daily.

#### **Special Cases:**  
* **Elderly Patients** Start with lower doses (50-100 mg twice daily) and adjust as needed. Reduce the dose in cases of renal impairment.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment** Reduce the dose based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction** Use with caution as sulpiride is primarily eliminated renally, but it may be contraindicated in severe impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions** Use cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, epilepsy, glaucoma, prostatic hyperplasia, and other conditions.



### **Clinical Use Cases**  

Sulpiride's use in intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, and emergency situations is not routinely indicated. It is primarily an antipsychotic medication.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments are necessary for renal impairment based on creatinine clearance:

* CrCl 30-60 mL/min:  Two-thirds of the normal dose, or prolong the dosage interval by a factor of 1.5.
* CrCl 10-30 mL/min: Half the normal dose, or prolong the dosage interval by a factor of 2.
* CrCl < 10 mL/min: One-third of the normal dose, or prolong the dosage interval by a factor of 3.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
Hyperprolactinemia, insomnia, sedation, drowsiness, extrapyramidal symptoms (tremor, akathisia, dystonia), constipation, increased liver enzymes, maculopapular rash, breast pain, weight gain.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), QT prolongation, ventricular arrhythmias (torsades de pointes), tardive dyskinesia, hypertensive crisis, blood dyscrasias (leukopenia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis).

### **Long-Term Effects**
Tardive dyskinesia, weight gain, metabolic changes (dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
NMS, QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, agranulocytosis.


## **Contraindications**
Phaeochromocytoma, acute porphyria, hypersensitivity to sulpiride, concomitant prolactin-dependent tumors (e.g., pituitary prolactinomas, breast cancer), severe renal or hepatic impairment, CNS depression, coma, alcohol intoxication, concomitant use of levodopa or antiparkinsonian drugs, bone marrow suppression.

## **Drug Interactions**
Drugs that prolong the QT interval (e.g., some antiarrhythmics, antidepressants),  antihypertensives, CNS depressants (alcohol, sedatives), antacids, sucralfate, lithium, dopaminergic agents (levodopa, ropinirole), sympathomimetics.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
Sulpiride crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk.  Its use during pregnancy is not recommended unless the benefits clearly outweigh the potential risks.  Neonates exposed to sulpiride during the third trimester are at risk of extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms.  A decision should be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue sulpiride therapy, taking into account the benefits and risks for both the mother and the child.
