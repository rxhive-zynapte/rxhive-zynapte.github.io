## **Usage**

Sunitinib malate is prescribed for the treatment of several types of cancer:

* **Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST):**  Specifically for GIST that cannot be surgically removed, has metastasized, or has progressed despite imatinib mesylate treatment.
* **Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC):** For RCC that has spread to other parts of the body.
* **Adjuvant Treatment of RCC:** Following nephrectomy in patients at high risk of recurrence.
* **Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (pNET):** For progressive, well-differentiated pNET that is unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Sunitinib is a multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

**Mechanism of Action:** Sunitinib inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) 1, 2, and 3, platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) α and β, stem cell factor receptor (KIT), FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor (RET). By inhibiting these RTKs, sunitinib blocks signaling pathways involved in tumor angiogenesis (blood vessel formation), tumor growth, and metastasis.

## **Alternate Names**

**International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Sunitinib malate

**Brand Name:** Sutent


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Sunitinib exerts its anti-cancer effects primarily by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. Inhibition of VEGFRs reduces the formation of new blood vessels that supply the tumor, thereby limiting its growth and spread.  Inhibition of PDGFR, KIT, and other RTKs directly targets tumor cell growth and survival.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Sunitinib is orally administered and well-absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 6 to 12 hours. Food may slightly delay absorption, but does not significantly affect overall bioavailability.
* **Metabolism:** Sunitinib is primarily metabolized by the liver, mainly through CYP3A4 enzyme.  A major active metabolite, *N*-desethyl sunitinib, contributes to the drug's therapeutic activity.
* **Elimination:** Sunitinib and its metabolites are primarily eliminated in the feces, with a small portion excreted in urine. The elimination half-life of sunitinib is approximately 40-60 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing.

**Mode of Action:** Sunitinib competitively binds to the ATP-binding site of its target RTKs, thereby preventing phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling cascades.  This leads to inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**  Sunitinib is an inhibitor of multiple RTKs, as outlined above. It primarily acts by inhibiting receptor autophosphorylation. The main metabolic pathway involves CYP3A4.

**Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly fecal excretion, with minor renal excretion. Metabolism primarily via CYP3A4.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **GIST and Advanced RCC:** 50 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks, followed by a 2-week off period (Schedule 4/2), to complete a 6-week cycle.
* **Adjuvant Treatment of RCC:** 50 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks off (Schedule 4/2), for a maximum of 9 cycles (54 weeks).
* **pNET:** 37.5 mg orally once daily continuously, without a scheduled off-treatment period.

#### **Children:**  The safety and efficacy of sunitinib in pediatric patients have not been fully established. Limited data suggest a possible starting dose of 20 mg/m² on a 4-weeks-on, 2-weeks-off schedule.  Careful monitoring and dose adjustments are crucial in pediatric use.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No specific starting dose adjustment is required. Close monitoring for toxicity is recommended.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No starting dose adjustment needed. Monitor and adjust subsequent doses based on individual safety and tolerability.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** 
    * Mild to Moderate Impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B): No starting dose adjustment needed. Careful monitoring is recommended.
    * Severe Impairment (Child-Pugh Class C):  Contraindicated.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring is required in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, bleeding disorders, and electrolyte imbalances.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Sunitinib's clinical use focuses on its approved indications, GIST, RCC, and pNET. Dosing remains consistent with standard recommendations, regardless of the setting (inpatient, outpatient, intensive care).  It does not have specific applications for intubation, surgical procedures, or mechanical ventilation. It is not typically used in emergency situations like cardiac arrest or status epilepticus.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary based on individual safety and tolerability.  Dose modifications are typically made in 12.5 mg increments. Dose reductions may be necessary for adverse events, while dose increases might be considered in cases of concomitant medications inducing CYP3A4.  Renal and hepatic impairment (except severe hepatic impairment) do not require initial dose adjustments, but necessitate careful monitoring and potential subsequent adjustments.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, hand-foot syndrome (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia), hypertension, skin discoloration, hair color changes, altered taste, anorexia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Hepatotoxicity (including liver failure), cardiac dysfunction (including heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy), QT interval prolongation, Torsades de pointes, hemorrhagic events, thromboembolic events, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism,  hypoglycemia, osteonecrosis of the jaw, adrenal insufficiency, gastrointestinal perforation.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic complications from prolonged use may include persistent hypertension, cardiac dysfunction, hypothyroidism, and secondary malignancies.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Clinically significant ADRs include severe hepatotoxicity, cardiac events (myocardial infarction, heart failure), QT interval prolongation/Torsades de pointes, severe hemorrhage, thromboembolic events, and osteonecrosis of the jaw.  These require immediate medical intervention.



## **Contraindications**

* **Hypersensitivity:** Sunitinib is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or its excipients.
* **Severe Hepatic Impairment (Child-Pugh Class C).**

## **Drug Interactions**

* **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, erythromycin, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice) can significantly increase sunitinib plasma concentrations.  If co-administration is unavoidable, reduce the sunitinib dose and monitor carefully.
* **CYP3A4 Inducers:** Strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. John's Wort) can decrease sunitinib plasma concentrations.  Avoid co-administration if possible or consider dose adjustment.
* **Anticoagulants:**  Sunitinib can increase bleeding risk.  Monitor coagulation parameters in patients receiving concomitant anticoagulants.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Category D (FDA); Category D (AU TGA).
* **Fetal Risks:** Sunitinib can cause fetal harm, including embryolethality, craniofacial and skeletal malformations.  It should be avoided during pregnancy.  Effective contraception is mandatory.
* **Breastfeeding:** Sunitinib and its metabolites are excreted in rat milk.  It is not known whether they are present in human milk, but due to potential risks to the infant, breastfeeding is contraindicated during sunitinib treatment and for 4 weeks after the last dose.
