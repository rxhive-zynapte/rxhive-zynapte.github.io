## **Usage**

- Suxamethonium is prescribed for the production of skeletal muscle relaxation during surgical procedures requiring only brief relaxation such as endotracheal intubation, endoscopic examinations, orthopedic manipulations, and electroconvulsive therapy. It's also used to mitigate muscle contractions during pharmacologically or electrically induced convulsions.
- **Pharmacological Classification**: Neuromuscular blocking agent, depolarizing type.
- **Mechanism of Action**: Suxamethonium acts as a depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent, mimicking the action of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction.  It binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the motor end-plate, causing persistent depolarization. This initially leads to muscle fasciculations (twitching) followed by flaccid paralysis due to the inability of the muscle membrane to repolarize.

## **Alternate Names**

- Succinylcholine Chloride
- Anectine (brand name)
- Quelicin (brand name)
- Scoline (brand name)
- Sucol (brand name)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Suxamethonium depolarizes the motor end-plate, initially causing muscle fasciculations followed by flaccid paralysis. It has no effect on consciousness, pain threshold, or cerebration.
- **Pharmacokinetics**:
    - **Absorption**: Primarily administered intravenously (IV) and less commonly intramuscularly (IM).  IV administration leads to a rapid onset of action (30-60 seconds). IM administration has a slower onset (2-3 minutes).
    - **Metabolism**: Rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma pseudocholinesterase (butyrylcholinesterase) to succinylmonocholine and choline, with further metabolism of succinylmonocholine to succinic acid and choline.
    - **Elimination**:  Primarily via renal excretion of the metabolites, with a small percentage of the drug excreted unchanged.
- **Mode of Action**: Binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the motor end-plate, causing persistent depolarization and preventing further activation by acetylcholine, leading to muscle paralysis.
- **Receptor Binding**: Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist.
- **Elimination Pathways**: Renal excretion of metabolites.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults**:

- **IV**:  0.6 mg/kg (range 0.3-1.1 mg/kg) for intubation, administered over 10-30 seconds. For longer procedures, an IV infusion of 2.5-4.3 mg/minute (0.1-0.2% solution in 5% dextrose or normal saline) can be used.  Maximum total dose for infusion: 500 mg/hour.
- **IM**: Up to 2.5 mg/kg (maximum 150 mg total) if IV access is unavailable.


#### **Children**:

- **IV**:  1-2 mg/kg. Continuous IV infusions are not recommended in children due to the risk of malignant hyperthermia. Pre-treatment with atropine may be necessary to reduce the risk of bradycardia.
- **IM**: Up to 4-5 mg/kg in infants, up to 4 mg/kg in older children (maximum 150 mg total).


#### **Special Cases**:

- **Elderly Patients**: Similar dosage to adults but may require close monitoring due to increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias, especially in patients taking digitalis.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Use with caution as suxamethonium metabolites are renally excreted. Monitor for prolonged paralysis.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: May exhibit prolonged paralysis due to decreased pseudocholinesterase activity; avoid repeated doses.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular, respiratory, or neuromuscular diseases, electrolyte imbalances, or suspected cardiac glycoside toxicity.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation**: 0.6-1 mg/kg IV.
- **Surgical Procedures** (short duration): IV bolus or infusion as described above.
- **Mechanical Ventilation**: IV infusion, adjusting rate according to response.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**:  Primarily for facilitating intubation or short procedures.  Continuous use is generally avoided.
- **Emergency Situations**: IV administration for rapid sequence intubation.

### **Dosage Adjustments**:

- Monitor renal and hepatic function and adjust the dose as needed.  
- Individuals with genetic polymorphisms affecting pseudocholinesterase activity may experience prolonged paralysis and require lower doses.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**:

- Muscle fasciculations
- Post-operative muscle pain
- Increased salivation

- Prolonged apnea
- Anaphylaxis
- Rhabdomyolysis


### **Long-Term Effects**:

- Myoglobinuria (rare)
- Rarely, long-term effects may arise as consequences of prolonged apnea or severe side effects (e.g., renal failure from rhabdomyolysis).


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**:

- **Halogenated anesthetic agents**: May increase risk of malignant hyperthermia.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category**: There is no established pregnancy category for Suxamethonium according to the FDA, but some sources classify it as a Pregnancy Category Z, indicating there is evidence of fetal risk.
- **Fetal risks**: Prolonged neuromuscular blockade has been observed in neonates exposed to Suxamethonium during pregnancy.
- **Breastfeeding**: Drug crosses the placenta in small amounts. Consider potential neonatal risks.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action**: Depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent.
