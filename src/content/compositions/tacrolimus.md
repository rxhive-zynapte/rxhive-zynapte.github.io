## **Usage**

Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressant primarily used to prevent organ rejection following transplantation (e.g., kidney, liver, heart, lung). It's also prescribed for atopic dermatitis and other conditions where the immune system needs to be suppressed.  It is pharmacologically classified as a calcineurin inhibitor.  Tacrolimus works by inhibiting calcineurin, a protein involved in T-cell activation. This inhibition reduces the production of cytokines, which are crucial for immune responses, thus suppressing the immune system and preventing organ rejection.

## **Alternate Names**

Tacrolimus is also known by the brand names Prograf, Astagraf XL, Envarsus XR, and Tacforius.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Tacrolimus inhibits calcineurin, which reduces interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, thereby suppressing T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation. This leads to a dampened immune response, crucial for preventing organ rejection.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Oral tacrolimus absorption is variable and incomplete. Food can decrease the rate and extent of absorption. Extended-release formulations exhibit prolonged absorption.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by CYP3A enzymes in the liver and small intestine.
* **Elimination:** Excreted mainly in bile and feces, with a small fraction in urine.

**Mode of Action:** Tacrolimus binds to FK-binding protein 12 (FKBP12). This complex inhibits calcineurin phosphatase activity, blocking the dephosphorylation and translocation of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), a transcription factor critical for T-cell activation.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral (immediate-release):** Initial 0.075 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours.  The dosage is weight-based and adjusted according to blood levels.
* **Oral (extended-release):** Initial 0.14 mg/kg/day once daily.
* **IV:** 0.01 mg/kg/day (heart transplant) or 0.03-0.05 mg/kg/day (kidney/liver transplant) by continuous infusion initially. Transition to oral therapy as soon as possible.

#### **Children:**

* **Oral (immediate-release):** Initial 0.3 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours (for various transplants). Dosage adjusted based on blood levels and clinical response.  Use and dose must be determined by a doctor for children younger than 4 years of age for kidney transplant.
* **Oral (extended-release):**  Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Close monitoring is recommended, and dose adjustments may be necessary due to age-related decline in organ function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Close monitoring and dose reduction may be required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments are usually necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized dosing is essential; consider drug interactions and potential for exacerbating existing conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources focus on the prevention of organ rejection after transplantation. Specific dosage guidelines for other clinical use cases, like those listed below, were not present in the sources and are therefore not specified:

* **Intubation**
* **Surgical Procedures**
* **Mechanical Ventilation**
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
* **Emergency Situations**


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are made based on blood tacrolimus levels, clinical response, and tolerability. Consider renal/hepatic function, drug interactions, and other patient-specific factors.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Headache, tremor, diarrhea, hypertension, hyperglycemia, insomnia, nausea, vomiting,  abdominal pain,  infection, hair loss, acne,  kidney problems, paresthesia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity (seizures, encephalopathy), infections (due to immunosuppression), malignancies (e.g., lymphoma, skin cancer), hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia, QT prolongation.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Increased risk of infections, malignancies (especially skin cancer and lymphoproliferative disorders), renal dysfunction, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Anaphylaxis, angioedema, thrombotic microangiopathy, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to tacrolimus or HCO-60 (in the injectable formulation). Netherton syndrome (topical formulation). Use with caution in patients with pre-existing renal or hepatic impairment, diabetes, hypertension, or QT prolongation.


## **Drug Interactions**

Numerous drug interactions exist. Tacrolimus is metabolized by CYP3A4.

* **CYP3A4 Inhibitors (increase tacrolimus levels):**  Antifungals (ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole), macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, clarithromycin), HIV protease inhibitors (ritonavir), calcium channel blockers (nifedipine, nicardipine, verapamil), grapefruit juice.
* **CYP3A4 Inducers (decrease tacrolimus levels):**  Anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital), rifampin, St. John's wort.
* **Other Interactions:**  Nephrotoxic drugs (aminoglycosides, NSAIDs), neurotoxic drugs (ganciclovir, acyclovir), drugs affecting potassium levels (diuretics, ACE inhibitors).



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Tacrolimus can cross the placenta and is present in breast milk. 

* **Pregnancy:** Use only if potential benefit outweighs the risk. Tacrolimus may cause fetal harm (prematurity, birth defects, low birth weight, fetal distress). Closely monitor maternal and fetal well-being.
* **Breastfeeding:** Tacrolimus is present in breast milk, but the amount is considered low and probably safe for breastfeeding infants. Monitor infant for potential side effects (e.g., infection).



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Calcineurin inhibitor, suppresses T-cell activation.
* **Side Effects:** Headache, tremor, diarrhea, hypertension, hyperglycemia, nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, infections, malignancies.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, Netherton syndrome (topical).
* **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers, nephrotoxic/neurotoxic drugs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; monitor closely.
* **Dosage:** Variable, weight-based, adjusted based on blood levels.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Tacrolimus blood levels, renal function, blood pressure, blood glucose, electrolyte levels.


## **Popular Combinations**

Tacrolimus is frequently used in combination with other immunosuppressants, such as corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) and mycophenolate mofetil, to prevent organ rejection.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Monitor for infections, malignancies, renal dysfunction, and other side effects.
* **Specific Populations:** Close monitoring and dosage adjustments may be needed in pregnant/breastfeeding women, children, the elderly, and patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid grapefruit juice. Vaccinations may be less effective.
