## **Usage**

- Tadalafil is prescribed for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Tadalafil inhibits PDE5, an enzyme that breaks down cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). In ED, this leads to increased cGMP levels in the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum, promoting vasodilation and facilitating erection upon sexual stimulation. In PAH, the same mechanism leads to vasodilation in the pulmonary arteries, reducing pulmonary vascular resistance and improving blood flow.

## **Alternate Names**

- International and regional variations: None specifically mentioned.
- **Brand Names:** Cialis®, Adcirca®, Alyq™.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Tadalafil's primary effect is smooth muscle relaxation, achieved through PDE5 inhibition and subsequent increase in cGMP. This results in vasodilation in specific tissues, including the corpus cavernosum in the penis and pulmonary vasculature.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Tadalafil is readily absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 2 hours. Food does not significantly affect absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 in the liver.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted mainly in the feces and to a lesser extent in urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 17.5 hours, allowing for a longer duration of action compared to other PDE5 inhibitors.
- **Mode of Action:** Tadalafil binds to and inhibits PDE5, preventing the degradation of cGMP, which sustains smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Tadalafil specifically inhibits PDE5. It does not directly bind to receptors or modulate neurotransmitters in the same way that some other drugs do.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4, followed by excretion primarily through feces and to a lesser extent in urine.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **ED (as needed):** 10 mg orally, taken 30 minutes before anticipated sexual activity. The dose may be adjusted to 5 mg or 20 mg based on individual response. Maximum once per day.
- **ED (daily):** 2.5 mg or 5 mg orally once a day, taken at approximately the same time, regardless of sexual activity.
- **BPH/ED and BPH:** 5 mg orally once a day, taken at approximately the same time.
- **PAH:** 40 mg orally once a day (may be initiated at 20 mg in elderly patients).

#### **Children:**

- Tadalafil is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** May require lower starting doses, particularly for PAH (20 mg once daily).  Dose adjustments should be made based on individual tolerability.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    - Mild to moderate impairment: No dose adjustment necessary.
    - Severe impairment: 10 mg maximum dose for on-demand use. Daily dosing is not recommended.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
    - Mild to moderate impairment: No dose adjustment necessary.
    - Severe impairment: 10 mg maximum dose. Careful benefit-risk assessment is required. Daily dosing not evaluated.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other conditions. Dosage adjustments may be necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Tadalafil is not indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjust dosage based on individual patient response and tolerability.
- Consider renal/hepatic function, comorbid conditions, and concomitant medications.
- Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism may influence dosage requirements, but specific guidelines are not universally established.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Headache, dyspepsia, back pain, myalgia, flushing, nasal congestion, dizziness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Priapism (prolonged erection), sudden vision loss, sudden hearing loss, allergic reactions (including angioedema and hives), severe hypotension.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Limited data on long-term effects, but potential for cardiovascular complications with chronic use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

As mentioned under "Rare but Serious Side Effects," any occurrence of priapism, sudden vision or hearing loss, severe allergic reactions, or significant hypotension requires urgent medical intervention.



## **Contraindications**

- CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin): Decrease tadalafil plasma concentrations.
- Alcohol: May increase risk of hypotension and dizziness.
- Grapefruit juice: May increase tadalafil exposure.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** B (PAH). Not indicated for ED/BPH in women.
- **Fetal Risks/Teratogenicity:** Limited data available. Use only if clearly needed for PAH.
- **Breastfeeding:** Excretion in breast milk unknown.  Not recommended.
