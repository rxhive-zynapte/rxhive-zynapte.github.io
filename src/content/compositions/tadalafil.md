## **Usage**

Tadalafil is prescribed for the treatment of:

* **Erectile Dysfunction (ED):** Improves the ability to achieve and maintain an erection.
* **Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH):** Relieves symptoms associated with an enlarged prostate.
* **Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH):** Improves exercise capacity in patients with this condition.

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor.

**Mechanism of Action:** Tadalafil inhibits PDE5, an enzyme that breaks down cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). In the corpus cavernosum of the penis, increased cGMP levels promote smooth muscle relaxation, leading to increased blood flow and facilitating erection.  In pulmonary arteries, vasodilation reduces pulmonary vascular resistance and improves blood flow. For BPH, it relaxes smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder.

## **Alternate Names**

Generic: Tadalafil

Brand names: Cialis, Adcirca

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Tadalafil's primary effect is smooth muscle relaxation mediated by increased cGMP levels. This vasodilatory effect impacts the corpus cavernosum in ED, pulmonary vasculature in PAH, and the prostate and bladder neck in BPH.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Rapidly absorbed after oral administration.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 enzyme system in the liver.
* **Elimination:** Excreted primarily in feces, with a smaller portion in urine.  The elimination half-life is approximately 17.5 hours, contributing to its longer duration of action compared to other PDE5 inhibitors.

**Mode of Action:**  Tadalafil selectively inhibits PDE5, preventing the degradation of cGMP. This leads to higher cGMP concentrations, activating protein kinase G and causing smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation in specific tissues.

**Receptor Binding:** Tadalafil's action is primarily through PDE5 inhibition, not direct receptor binding.

**Enzyme Inhibition:** Selective inhibition of PDE5.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4, followed by fecal excretion.  A small amount is excreted unchanged in the urine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **ED (as needed):** 10 mg orally prior to anticipated sexual activity, adjustable to 5 mg or 20 mg based on individual response and tolerability.  Maximum once daily.
* **ED (daily):** 2.5 mg or 5mg orally once daily, at approximately the same time each day, regardless of the timing of sexual activity.
* **BPH/ED (daily):** 5 mg orally once daily.
* **PAH:** 40 mg (two 20 mg tablets) orally once daily.


#### **Children:**  Use in children is generally not recommended. For PAH in children 2-17 years of age, refer to specialized pediatric dosing guidelines.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically required, but start at the lower end of the dosing range and monitor closely.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary. For severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min), tadalafil use for PAH is not recommended. For ED, consult specific dosing recommendations based on the degree of impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustment may be necessary.  For severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), tadalafil use for PAH and ED is generally not recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration is required for patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other conditions. Consult specific recommendations for each condition.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Tadalafil's clinical use in scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations is not standard practice and typically not indicated.  Its primary indications are ED, BPH, and PAH.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments based on patient-specific factors like renal or hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms should be made under careful medical supervision, following specific clinical guidelines.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Headache, dyspepsia, back pain, myalgia, flushing, nasal congestion, limb pain.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Priapism (prolonged erection), sudden vision or hearing loss, allergic reactions (including angioedema), severe hypotension.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Limited data exist on long-term effects. Chronic complications are uncommon.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Serious ADRs require immediate medical attention and may include cardiovascular events, visual disturbances, and allergic reactions.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to tadalafil.
* Concomitant use of nitrates.
* Patients with severe cardiovascular disease.
* Use with caution in patients with anatomical penile deformities.

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Nitrates:**  Contraindicated due to the risk of severe hypotension.
* **CYP3A4 Inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, ritonavir):**  May increase tadalafil plasma concentrations, requiring dosage adjustments.
* **Alpha-blockers:** May potentiate hypotensive effects.
* **Alcohol:**  May increase the risk of certain side effects, such as dizziness and headache.
* **Grapefruit juice:** May increase tadalafil levels.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Category B (animal studies show no fetal risk, but human studies are limited).  Use during pregnancy only if clearly needed.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Tadalafil is excreted in breast milk.  The potential risk to the infant is unknown.  Use with caution.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** PDE5 inhibitor, increasing cGMP levels and promoting smooth muscle relaxation.
* **Side Effects:** Headache, dyspepsia, back pain, myalgia, flushing.  Rarely, priapism, vision/hearing changes.
* **Contraindications:**  Nitrate use, severe cardiovascular disease.
* **Drug Interactions:** Nitrates, CYP3A4 inhibitors, alpha-blockers.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution. Category B.
* **Dosage:**  Varies depending on indication (ED, BPH, PAH), ranging from 2.5 mg to 40 mg daily.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, heart rate, visual and auditory function.

## **Popular Combinations**

Tadalafil is typically used as monotherapy. Combination therapy with other drugs for specific conditions should be carefully considered based on individual patient needs and clinical guidelines. For example, finasteride and tadalafil are sometimes used together for treating BPH.

## **Precautions**

* Pre-existing medical conditions: Assess cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal function.
* Pregnant Women: Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the risks.
* Breastfeeding Mothers: Use with caution.
* Children & Elderly: Pediatric use is limited, elderly patients may require lower doses.
* Lifestyle Considerations: Limit alcohol intake.
