## **Usage**

Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) primarily used to treat and prevent hormone receptor-positive (estrogen receptor-positive or progesterone receptor-positive) breast cancer in premenopausal and postmenopausal women and men. It is also indicated for the reduction of contralateral (in the opposite breast) breast cancer and for the treatment of McCune-Albright Syndrome and precocious puberty in children.


## **Alternate Names**

The generic name is tamoxifen citrate.  A popular brand name is Soltamox.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Tamoxifen acts as an estrogen antagonist in breast tissue by competitively binding to estrogen receptors. It blocks estrogen from promoting the growth of estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells.  In other tissues, such as the endometrium (uterine lining), tamoxifen may act as an estrogen agonist.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Tamoxifen is well-absorbed orally.
* **Metabolism:** It is extensively metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes to active metabolites, including N-desmethyltamoxifen (major active metabolite) and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (endoxifen) with higher potency than the parent drug. Genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6 influence the efficacy of the drug based on individual metabolic rates.
* **Elimination:** Excreted mainly in the feces via biliary excretion, with a small amount excreted in urine.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Breast cancer treatment (adjuvant and metastatic):** 20 mg orally once daily. Doses up to 40 mg/day may be used in advanced cases, but no additional clinical benefit has been shown. Doses greater than 20 mg should be divided into twice-daily administration. Treatment typically continues for 5-10 years for early-stage breast cancer.
* **Breast cancer risk reduction:** 20 mg orally once daily for 5 years.


#### **Children:**

* **McCune-Albright Syndrome and precocious puberty:** Dosage is individualized and based on the child's weight and clinical response. Start with a low dose and titrate as needed.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly patients:** No dose adjustment required, however close observation required due to increased chance of adverse events.
* **Patients with renal impairment:** No dose adjustment required.
* **Patients with hepatic dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustment is available.
* **Patients with comorbid conditions:** Caution advised for patients with history of blood clots, stroke, or endometrial cancer.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  
Tamoxifen is not typically used in the clinical situations described below:

* **Intubation**  
* **Surgical Procedures**  
* **Mechanical Ventilation**  
* **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**  
* **Emergency Situations** (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest)


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be considered in patients with CYP2D6 polymorphisms or concomitant medications affecting CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 activity.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, irregular periods, vaginal bleeding or discharge, fluid retention (edema), nausea, weight changes, skin rash, fatigue, mood changes, headache.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Uterine cancer (including endometrial hyperplasia, polyps, and sarcoma), stroke, blood clots (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism), cataracts and other eye problems, liver damage, hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Increased risk of endometrial cancer, stroke, and blood clots with prolonged use.



## **Contraindications**

* Pregnancy
* History of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) or concurrent anticoagulant therapy (for breast cancer risk reduction)
* Hypersensitivity to tamoxifen or any of its components.

## **Drug Interactions**

Tamoxifen interacts with numerous drugs, including:

* **CYP2D6 inhibitors:** Fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion (may decrease tamoxifen efficacy)
* **CYP3A4 inhibitors:** Ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin (may increase tamoxifen levels)
* **CYP3A4 inducers:** Rifampin, phenytoin (may decrease tamoxifen levels)
* **Anticoagulants:** Warfarin (increased risk of bleeding)
* **Aromatase inhibitors:** Anastrozole, letrozole (may decrease the effectiveness of both drugs)


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Contraindicated. Can cause fetal harm. Effective contraception is required during treatment and for 2 months after discontinuation.
* **Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated. Tamoxifen may be excreted in breast milk and could harm a nursing infant.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** SERM, estrogen antagonist in breast tissue.
* **Side Effects:** Hot flashes, vaginal bleeding, fluid retention, nausea, uterine cancer, stroke, blood clots.
* **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, venous thromboembolism history (for risk reduction), hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:** CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers, warfarin, aromatase inhibitors.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
* **Dosage:** 20-40 mg daily orally.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests, complete blood counts, endometrial monitoring (if indicated).

## **Popular Combinations**

Tamoxifen is often used alone. Its use is contraindicated with aromatase inhibitors if taken concurrently. Sequential use after surgery is the commonly adopted practice.



## **Precautions**

* Monitor for endometrial changes, blood clots, and liver function.
* Counsel patients on the risk of thromboembolic events, uterine cancer, and the need for contraception.
