## **Usage**

- Tannic acid is used to treat diarrhea, bleeding, hemorrhoids, cold sores, diaper rash, heat rash, and other conditions. It is also used as a flavoring agent in foods and beverages.  In manufacturing, it is used in ointments, suppositories; for tanning hides, manufacturing ink; and to kill dust mites. However, robust scientific evidence supporting many of these uses is lacking. It has shown some efficacy in reducing menstrual blood loss.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Astringent, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial.

## **Alternate Names**

- Gallotannin

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Tannic acid exerts its effects primarily through its astringent properties, which cause the contraction of tissues and the precipitation of proteins.  It also possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.  It can also decrease calcein efflux and the expression of PGP, MRP1, and MRP2 membrane efflux pumps.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Information on the pharmacokinetics of tannic acid is limited. It is known that it can be absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, especially through damaged skin, and may cause systemic effects. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys. The potential for drug interactions exists due to its protein-binding capabilities and its ability to alter enzyme activity. It may interact with iron supplements and also can also interact with other medications metabolized by the liver. It may inhibit or induce the activity of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes, altering the metabolism of drugs like warfarin, phenytoin, and certain antidepressants.
- **Mode of Action:** Tannic acid binds to proteins, forming complexes that can reduce inflammation, inhibit bleeding, and create a protective barrier on skin or mucous membranes.  It can also modulate drug efflux pathways, potentially leading to synergistic effects with certain chemotherapeutic drugs.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal and hepatic excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
Limited scientific information exists to determine an appropriate range of doses for tannic acid. For heavy menstrual bleeding, 2 tablets (650 mg per tablet) three times a day, not to exceed 5 days per menstrual cycle, is recommended.  

#### **Children:**
Use and dose must be determined by a doctor. Children 6 years and older: 1-2 tablets (containing tannic acid-albumin compound) 3-4 times daily, maximum 6 tablets per day. This dosage is for specific product formulation (Tannalbin tablets) for diarrhea and should not be generalized for other uses. Children under 6 should avoid use due to limited data.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Caution is advised. Dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction may be required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with liver or kidney disease, heart failure, or during fever or infectious diseases.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing guidelines for specific clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, and ICU use are not well-established for tannic acid.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Insufficient data are available to provide detailed dosage adjustments based on specific patient factors or clinical situations.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, headache, dizziness, skin irritation.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Liver damage, kidney damage, allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis).

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Potential for liver and kidney damage with prolonged high-dose use. Possible increased risk of nose or throat cancer with regular consumption of high-tannin herbs.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Anaphylaxis, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to tannic acid.
- Severe liver or kidney disease.
- Active thromboembolic disease (for tranexamic acid).
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding (for topical application to broken skin or large areas).

## **Drug Interactions**

- Iron supplements: Reduced iron absorption.
- Oral medications: Reduced drug absorption.
- Drugs metabolized by the liver (e.g., warfarin, phenytoin, some antidepressants): Altered drug metabolism. Many other potential drug interactions exist (refer to drugs.com interaction checker).
- Activated charcoal: Interference with its adsorbent action.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Topical application to broken skin or large areas is considered unsafe. Oral use during pregnancy and breastfeeding should be avoided due to lack of safety data.
