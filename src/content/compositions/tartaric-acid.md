## **Usage**

Tartaric acid is primarily used as a food additive (E334) for its antioxidant and acidifying properties, contributing to the sour taste in foods like candies and beverages.  It is also employed in the wine industry for acidity correction.  Medically, it's found in some effervescent antacid preparations in combination with sodium bicarbonate to generate carbon dioxide, causing stomach distension for diagnostic double-contrast radiography.  Limited evidence suggests potential use for asthma and swallowing problems, though further research is needed.

It is classified as an antioxidant, acidulant, and in high doses, a muscle toxin.

Tartaric acid's mechanism of action as an acidulant involves lowering the pH. As an antioxidant, it scavenges free radicals. In high doses, it inhibits malic acid production, leading to muscle toxicity.

## **Alternate Names**

- L(+)-Tartaric acid
- Dextro-tartaric acid
- Natural tartaric acid
- 2,3-Dihydroxysuccinic acid
- Threaric acid
- Cream of Tartar (potassium bitartrate, a salt of tartaric acid)

Brand Names (often in combination products):

- Ural
- Brioschi
- Avoral

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Tartaric acid primarily lowers pH when ingested.  It can cause a laxative effect, particularly with its salts like sodium tartrate.  In excessive amounts, it acts as a muscle toxin by inhibiting malic acid production, leading to potential paralysis.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

- **Absorption:** Tartaric acid is partially absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. A significant portion (80-85%) is metabolized by intestinal bacteria, mainly in the large intestine.
- **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by gut bacteria.
- **Elimination:** About 15-20% is excreted unchanged in the urine.

**Mode of action:** As a weak acid, it donates protons. It chelates calcium ions, potentially disrupting cell adhesion in the epidermis, leading to desquamation (skin peeling).  At high concentrations, it inhibits malic acid production, interfering with cellular respiration in muscles.

**Receptor binding/Enzyme inhibition:**  No specific receptor binding is known.  It inhibits malic acid production.

**Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion (15-20% unchanged), remainder metabolized by gut bacteria.


## **Dosage**

Dosage information for medicinal use of tartaric acid is limited.  Dosage for its use as a food additive is not within the scope of this guide.

### **Standard Dosage**

The limited medicinal use of tartaric acid primarily involves its presence in effervescent antacid mixtures, where the typical dose is based on the formulation's combined ingredients, usually 4-8 grams of the mix dissolved in water, taken up to four times daily.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The primary clinical use case for tartaric acid is within effervescent antacid preparations for symptomatic relief of mild gastrointestinal discomfort or as a negative contrast medium during double-contrast radiography. The dosages are based on the specific commercial product formulations.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects** (with high doses or prolonged use)

- Gastrointestinal irritation (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)
- Laxative effect

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects** (with very high doses)

- Kidney damage
- Blood abnormalities
- Convulsions
- Somnolence
- Respiratory problems
- Muscle toxicity (paralysis)

### **Long-Term Effects** (with repeated or prolonged ingestion)

- Mouth lesions
- Gastric ulcers
- Gastrointestinal hyperacidity
- Skin ulcerations (with prolonged skin contact)


## **Contraindications**

Limited data is available on specific contraindications. However, high doses should be avoided in individuals with:

- Renal impairment
- Known hypersensitivity to tartaric acid or its salts


## **Drug Interactions**

Tartaric acid may decrease the effectiveness of tetracycline antibiotics and certain other medications.  It can interact with amphetamines, potentially affecting their excretion. Refer to comprehensive drug interaction resources for a detailed list.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Tartaric acid is commonly consumed in foods during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Limited reliable information is available regarding its safety as a medicinal agent during these periods. Consult with a healthcare professional before using tartaric acid medicinally during pregnancy or breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Acidulant, antioxidant (at lower doses). Muscle toxin (at higher doses).
- **Side Effects:** GI irritation, laxative effect (common). Renal damage, convulsions, muscle paralysis (rare, high doses).
- **Contraindications:** Limited data. Exercise caution with renal impairment or hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:** May decrease tetracycline efficacy; interacts with some amphetamines.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Safety for medicinal use not well-established.
- **Dosage:**  For medicinal use (in antacids), as directed on product labeling.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Renal function (with high doses). Electrolyte balance.


## **Popular Combinations**

Tartaric acid is frequently combined with sodium bicarbonate in effervescent antacid products.


## **Precautions**

Monitor renal function with high doses. Assess for electrolyte imbalance with prolonged antacid use. Perform skin testing before applying topical tartaric acid to larger skin areas.
