      What should I do if I experience skin irritation with Tazarotene?**

      **A:**  If skin irritation occurs, you may reduce the frequency of
      application, reduce the concentration used (e.g., from 0.1% to 0.05%), or
      temporarily discontinue use until the irritation subsides. Consult your
      physician for guidance.

      Does Tazarotene make skin more sensitive to the sun?**

      **A:** Yes, tazarotene can increase photosensitivity. It's essential to
      use sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher and wear protective clothing
      when exposed to sunlight while using tazarotene.

## **Usage**

- Tazarotene is prescribed for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris (in the foam, gel, cream, and lotion formulations) and plaque psoriasis (in the cream and gel formulations) in adults and children over a certain age, depending on the formulation and condition being treated. It is also used to reduce fine facial wrinkles and certain types of dark and light spots on the face (in the 0.1% cream formulation).
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  retinoid, specifically an acetylenic retinoid.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Tazarotene is a prodrug that is converted to its active form, tazarotenic acid, in the skin. Tazarotenic acid binds to retinoic acid receptors (RARs), specifically RARβ and RARγ,  which regulate gene expression related to cell proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation, ultimately normalizing the abnormal keratinization and differentiation processes in the skin linked to acne and psoriasis.

## **Alternate Names**

- Tazarotenic acid (active form)
- **Brand Names:** Tazorac, Avage, Fabior, Arazlo


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Tazarotenic acid, the active metabolite, modulates gene expression by binding to specific nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs). This action leads to normalization of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, resulting in reduced inflammation and improved skin lesions in acne and psoriasis.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Tazarotene is applied topically and is metabolized in the skin to tazarotenic acid. Systemic absorption is minimal, especially with proper application to affected areas only.  
- **Mode of Action:** Tazarotene exerts its therapeutic effects by binding to RARβ and RARγ receptors in the skin. This binding influences gene expression, reduces inflammation, and normalizes cellular processes in the skin affected by acne or psoriasis.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Binds to retinoic acid receptors (RARs), particularly RARβ and RARγ. Does not significantly inhibit enzymes or modulate neurotransmitters.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily metabolized in the skin; minimal systemic absorption occurs, after which it is conjugated and excreted in urine and feces.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Acne:**
    - **Cream/Gel (0.05% or 0.1%):** Apply a thin film to the affected area(s) once daily, in the evening. Start with 0.05% and increase to 0.1% if tolerated and medically necessary.
    - **Foam (0.1%):** Apply a small amount to the affected area(s) once daily, in the evening.
    - **Lotion (0.045%):** Apply a thin layer to the affected area(s) once daily.
- **Psoriasis:**
    - **Cream/Gel (0.05% or 0.1%):** Apply a thin film to the affected area(s) once daily, in the evening. Start with 0.05% and increase to 0.1% if tolerated and medically necessary. Do not apply to more than 20% of body surface area.
- **Fine facial wrinkles/dark spots:**
    - **Cream (0.1%):** Apply a pea-sized amount to the entire face once daily at bedtime.


#### **Children:**

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution; no dosage adjustment is specifically recommended, but monitor for increased sensitivity.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustment is necessary due to minimal systemic absorption.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustment is necessary due to minimal systemic absorption.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient factors and monitor for any potential drug interactions.

Tazarotene is intended for topical dermatological use and is not indicated for:

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
