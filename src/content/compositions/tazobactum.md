# Tazobactum (Piperacillin/Tazobactam)

## **Usage**

Tazobactam is a combination medication consisting of the antibiotic piperacillin and the β-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam.  It is prescribed for a variety of bacterial infections, including:

* **Intra-abdominal infections:** Such as appendicitis with rupture or abscess, and peritonitis.
* **Skin and skin structure infections:** Including uncomplicated and complicated cellulitis.
* **Gynecological infections:** Such as endometritis and pelvic inflammatory disease.
* **Respiratory tract infections:** Including community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia.
* **Bone and joint infections.**
* **Septicemia.**
* **Urinary tract infections.**
* **Bacterial infections in neutropenic patients.**

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Antibiotic (β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination).

**Mechanism of Action:** Piperacillin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Tazobactam, a β-lactamase inhibitor, protects piperacillin from degradation by many bacterial β-lactamases, extending its spectrum of activity.


## **Alternate Names**

* Piperacillin/Tazobactam
* Pip/Tazo

**Brand Names:**  Tazocin, Zosyn, PipTaz-AFT.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Piperacillin/tazobactam exhibits bactericidal activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including many strains producing β-lactamases.  Tazobactam effectively inhibits most plasmid-mediated penicillinases and some chromosomal β-lactamases, significantly broadening piperacillin's spectrum.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Administered intravenously, resulting in rapid and complete absorption.
* **Distribution:** Widely distributed throughout the body, including tissues and fluids.  Crosses the placenta and is found in low concentrations in breast milk.
* **Metabolism:** Piperacillin is minimally metabolized. Tazobactam is metabolized to a minor extent.
* **Elimination:**  Both drugs are primarily excreted renally, with some elimination in bile.  Dose adjustments are needed for patients with renal impairment.

**Mode of Action:** Piperacillin targets bacterial PBPs, crucial enzymes involved in the final stages of peptidoglycan synthesis for the bacterial cell wall. By binding to PBPs, piperacillin inhibits the cross-linking of peptidoglycan strands, leading to cell wall instability and bacterial lysis.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Piperacillin binds to and inhibits PBPs. Tazobactam inhibits bacterial β-lactamases by forming a stable complex with the enzyme's active site, preventing the hydrolysis of piperacillin.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Most Indications:** 3.375 g intravenously every 6 hours (over 30 minutes), or 4.5 g every 8 hours.
* **Nosocomial Pneumonia:** 4.5 g every 6 hours, plus an aminoglycoside.
* **Severe Infections:**  Up to 18 g piperacillin/2.25 g tazobactam per day in divided doses.

#### **Children (2 months to 12 years):**

* **2 months to 9 months:** 80 mg piperacillin/10 mg tazobactam per kg body weight every 6-8 hours (IV infusion over 30 minutes).
* **>9 months and ≤ 40 kg:** 100 mg piperacillin/12.5 mg tazobactam per kg body weight every 6-8 hours (IV infusion over 30 minutes).
* **>40 kg:**  Same as adult dose.
* Duration of treatment: Typically 7-14 days, depending on infection severity and response.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Dose adjustment may be needed for those with impaired renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage should be reduced based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustment is usually necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution is advised for those with cystic fibrosis, seizures, or electrolyte imbalances.


### **Clinical Use Cases:**

* **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:** Dosing is similar to standard recommendations, but may be adjusted based on infection severity and patient-specific factors.
* **Emergency Situations:** Dosage may be increased in life-threatening situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments:**
Dosage modification is essential for renal impairment.  Consult specific guidelines for creatinine clearance-based recommendations.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Diarrhea
* Constipation
* Nausea
* Headache
* Insomnia
* Rash
* Pruritus

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* *Clostridioides difficile* infection
* Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Neutropenia (low white blood cell count)
* Seizures
* Acute kidney injury
* Liver dysfunction

### **Long-Term Effects:** No significant long-term adverse effects are typically associated with the usual course of Tazobactam therapy. However, prolonged use of any antibiotic may contribute to antibiotic resistance.



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to piperacillin, tazobactam, penicillins, cephalosporins, or β-lactamase inhibitors.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Methotrexate:** Tazobactam can decrease methotrexate clearance, leading to increased serum levels and toxicity.
* **Warfarin:** Tazobactam may enhance the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. Monitor INR closely.
* **Probenecid:** Concomitant use with probenecid can increase piperacillin levels.
* **Aminoglycosides:** Synergistic effects are seen against some gram-negative bacteria, but do not administer in the same IV line due to incompatibility.
* **Vecuronium:** Tazobactam may prolong the neuromuscular blockade of vecuronium and other neuromuscular blocking agents.
* **Other medications:** Numerous other drug interactions are possible; consult a comprehensive drug interaction resource.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:** B (Australian categorization).  Use during pregnancy only if clearly needed and the benefit outweighs the risk. Piperacillin and tazobactam cross the placenta.
* **Breastfeeding:** Piperacillin is present in low concentrations in breast milk. Tazobactam concentrations in human milk are unknown.  Exercise caution when administering to breastfeeding women.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Piperacillin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis; tazobactam protects piperacillin from β-lactamase degradation.
* **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, constipation, nausea, headache, insomnia, rash, allergic reactions, *C. difficile* infection, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to penicillins, cephalosporins, or β-lactamase inhibitors.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Methotrexate, warfarin, probenecid, aminoglycosides, vecuronium.
