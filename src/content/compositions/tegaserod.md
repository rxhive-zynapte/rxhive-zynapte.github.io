## **Usage**

Tegaserod is indicated for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) in adult women younger than 65 years of age.  It was previously indicated for chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults under 55.  Tegaserod is classified as a serotonin-4 (5-HT4) receptor agonist, also known as a serotonergic neuroenteric modulator. It works by stimulating peristalsis, increasing intestinal fluid secretion, and potentially reducing visceral hypersensitivity in the gut.


## **Alternate Names**

* **Generic Name:** Tegaserod maleate
* **Brand Name:** Zelnorm (no longer available in the U.S. except in limited emergency situations)
* **Other Names:** Zelmac, HTF 919, SDZ HTF-919.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Tegaserod is a partial 5-HT4 receptor agonist.  Stimulation of these receptors in the gastrointestinal tract enhances gastrointestinal motility, increases intestinal secretions, and may modulate visceral sensitivity.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Well absorbed orally. Taking it with food can slightly reduce Cmax (maximum concentration) but does not affect overall exposure (AUC, area under the curve).
* **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis in the stomach followed by oxidation and conjugation, resulting in the main metabolite, 5-methoxyindole-3-carboxylic acid glucuronide (M 29.0), which is inactive.  Direct glucuronidation is a minor pathway.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated in feces (about two-thirds) and the rest in urine, mainly as M 29.0. Plasma clearance is around 77 L/h, with a terminal half-life of roughly 11 hours.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (Women < 65 years old):**

* **IBS-C:** 6 mg orally twice daily, approximately 30 minutes before meals.
* Treatment should be discontinued if there is no adequate symptom control after 4-6 weeks.

#### **Children:**

* Not established.  Safety and efficacy not determined.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients (≥65 years):**  Contraindicated.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No dose adjustment needed for mild to moderate impairment. Contraindicated in severe renal impairment (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m²).
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment for mild to moderate dysfunction. Contraindicated in moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C). 

### **Clinical Use Cases**  
Tegaserod is not indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be considered in specific cases based on individual patient factors.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Headache
* Diarrhea (often transient, occurring within the first week)
* Dizziness
* Abdominal pain
* Nausea
* Flatulence

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Ischemic colitis (symptoms include rectal bleeding, bloody diarrhea, and new or worsening abdominal pain)
* Myocardial infarction (MI)
* Stroke
* Transient ischemic attack (TIA)
* Angina

### **Long-Term Effects**

Long-term effects not well-established, as treatment duration is limited to a maximum of 12 weeks.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Serious cardiovascular events (MI, stroke, TIA) and ischemic colitis.


## **Contraindications**

* History of MI, stroke, TIA, or angina
* History of bowel obstruction, symptomatic gallbladder disease, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, or abdominal adhesions
* History of ischemic colitis or other forms of intestinal ischemia
* Severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease
* Moderate or severe hepatic impairment
* Hypersensitivity to tegaserod
* Diarrhea
* Age 65 or older



## **Drug Interactions**

Limited clinically significant drug interactions are known.  It may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.  Concomitant use with drugs inhibiting P-glycoprotein (e.g., quinidine) may increase tegaserod exposure, but the clinical significance is unclear.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Pregnancy Category B.  While animal studies have shown some adverse effects at high doses, human data are limited.  Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Not recommended. Tegaserod and/or metabolites are present in rat milk.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** 5-HT4 receptor partial agonist stimulating gut motility and secretions.
* **Side Effects:** Headache, diarrhea, dizziness, abdominal pain, nausea.  Serious:  Ischemic colitis, MI, stroke.
* **Contraindications:** History of cardiovascular or intestinal ischemic events, severe renal/hepatic impairment, bowel obstruction.  Age 65 or older.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Limited clinical interactions.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution in pregnancy if benefits outweigh risks.  Not recommended while breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** 6 mg twice daily before meals for IBS-C (women <65 years). Max 12 weeks.


## **Popular Combinations**

Not typically used in combination therapy.

## **Precautions**

* Screen for contraindications.
* Monitor for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal side effects.
* Discontinue if symptoms of ischemic colitis or serious cardiovascular events occur.
* Be aware of the potential for suicidal thoughts and behavior.
