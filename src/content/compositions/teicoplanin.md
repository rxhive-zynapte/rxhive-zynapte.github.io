## **Usage**

Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic prescribed for serious infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA).  It is particularly useful when other antibiotics, like flucloxacillin, are not suitable.  Conditions treated include:

* Skin and soft tissue infections
* Bone and joint infections (e.g., osteomyelitis, septic arthritis)
* Pneumonia (hospital-acquired and community-acquired)
* Urinary tract infections
* Endocarditis
* Septicemia/bacteremia
* Peritonitis (especially in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis - CAPD)
* *Clostridioides difficile* infections (oral administration)

Its pharmacological classification is **antibiotic**.

Teicoplanin's mechanism of action involves inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to the D-alanyl-D-alanine terminus of peptidoglycan precursors.  This prevents cross-linking of peptidoglycan chains, leading to a weakened cell wall and bacterial death.


## **Alternate Names**

Teicoplanin is the generic name. A commonly known brand name is **Targocid**.



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Teicoplanin exerts a bactericidal effect primarily against Gram-positive bacteria. It disrupts cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). Oral administration is used for *C. difficile* infections. IV administration offers rapid attainment of therapeutic levels. IM administration is also effective but may cause local reactions.
* **Distribution:**  Distributes widely in tissues and body fluids, achieving therapeutic concentrations in bone, lung, and peritoneal fluid.
* **Metabolism:**  Minimal metabolism occurs.
* **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated by renal excretion, with a long half-life (40-70 hours in adults). This allows for once-daily dosing after an initial loading dose. Dose adjustments are necessary in patients with renal impairment.

**Mode of Action:** Teicoplanin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to the D-alanyl-D-alanine terminus of peptidoglycan precursors.  This action prevents the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links, leading to a weakened cell wall and bacterial lysis.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Teicoplanin's primary mechanism is not through receptor binding or enzyme inhibition but rather through direct interaction with peptidoglycan precursors.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Mild to Moderate Infections:** Initial loading dose of 6 mg/kg IV every 12 hours for three doses, followed by 6 mg/kg IV or IM once daily.
* **Severe Infections (e.g., endocarditis, sepsis, osteomyelitis):** Initial loading dose of 12 mg/kg IV every 12 hours for three doses, followed by 12 mg/kg IV or IM once daily. Higher doses (up to 12 mg/kg) might be considered for severe infections like endocarditis caused by *S. aureus.*
* **C. difficile infections:** 100-200 mg orally twice daily for 7-14 days.

#### **Children:**

* **< 2 months:** 16 mg/kg IV loading dose on day 1, followed by 8 mg/kg IV once daily. Administer via IV infusion over 30 minutes.
* **2 months to 12 years:** 10 mg/kg IV every 12 hours for three loading doses, followed by 6-10 mg/kg IV once daily. Administer via IV injection over 3-5 minutes or IV infusion over 30 minutes.
* **> 12 years:**  Same as adult dose.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Same as adult dose unless renal impairment is present.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment is necessary based on creatinine clearance.  After the initial loading dose,  adjust the maintenance dose as follows:
    * CrCl > 60 mL/min: Standard dosing.
    * CrCl 30-60 mL/min: Administer half the normal dose every 24 hours or the full dose every 48 hours.
    * CrCl < 30 mL/min: Administer one-third of the maintenance dose every 24 hours or the full dose every 72 hours.
    * Dialysis patients:  Administer one-third of the full dose every 24 hours or the full dose every 72 hours.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments are usually required.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider individual patient factors, especially for those with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or other significant comorbidities.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing adjustments may be needed based on clinical response, infection severity, and individual patient factors. In general, the following dosages are recommended:

* **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:**  Follow the dosing guidelines for severe infections as detailed above, adjusting as needed based on individual patient characteristics and the severity of the infection.
* **Emergency Situations:** Initiate treatment with a loading dose as described for severe infections and adjust subsequent dosing based on patient response and renal function.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Consider dose modifications for renal/hepatic impairment, other metabolic disorders, or genetic factors affecting drug metabolism. Therapeutic drug monitoring is advised for serious or deep-seated infections, prolonged treatment, and patients with intravenous drug use. Target trough levels should be maintained between 20-40 mg/L for most infections, with higher trough levels (30-40 mg/L) for endocarditis.
