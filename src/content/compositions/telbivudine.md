      Is telbivudine safe in pregnancy?**


      **A:**  Telbivudine is Pregnancy Category B. While animal studies haven't
      shown fetal harm, it should be used during pregnancy only if clearly
      needed.  It has been shown to reduce the risk of mother-to-infant HBV
      transmission when used in the second and/or third trimester along with
      hepatitis B immunoglobulin and HBV vaccine administered to the newborn. 
      Discuss the risks and benefits with the patient.

## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Telbivudine is prescribed for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (HBV) infection in adult patients with evidence of viral replication and either persistent elevations in serum aminotransferases (ALT or AST) or histologically active disease.  It is important to note that telbivudine does *not* cure hepatitis B, but helps to control the viral replication.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), Antiviral agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Telbivudine inhibits HBV DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase), blocking viral DNA replication.  It is a synthetic thymidine nucleoside analogue that is phosphorylated intracellularly to its active triphosphate form. This active form competes with the natural substrate (thymidine 5'-triphosphate) for incorporation into viral DNA.  The incorporation of telbivudine triphosphate into the viral DNA chain terminates further DNA synthesis, thus effectively halting viral replication.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Telbivudine
- **Brand Name:** Tyzeka (Note: Tyzeka has been discontinued in the US.)
- **Other Names:** Sebivo (EU)



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Telbivudine exerts its antiviral effect by inhibiting HBV DNA polymerase. This leads to a reduction in HBV DNA levels in serum, indicating a decrease in viral load and replication.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Telbivudine is well absorbed orally and can be taken with or without food. Its absorption and exposure are unaffected by a high-fat, high-calorie meal.
    - **Metabolism:**  No metabolites of telbivudine have been detected in humans following administration.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated by renal excretion (~42% as unchanged drug).  The terminal elimination half-life is 40-49 hours.  


- **Mode of Action:** Telbivudine acts as a competitive inhibitor of HBV DNA polymerase by binding to the active site of the enzyme. This prevents the enzyme from incorporating natural nucleotides into the growing viral DNA chain.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Telbivudine functions as a viral DNA polymerase inhibitor. It does not significantly bind to other receptors or modulate neurotransmitters.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily via renal excretion.
