      Can Telmisartan affect kidney function?**

      **A:** While telmisartan can be protective in certain kidney conditions,
      it can also, in rare cases, worsen kidney function, particularly in
      patients with pre-existing kidney disease. Monitoring of kidney function
      is essential.

## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Telmisartan is primarily prescribed for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure). It is also used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke in patients 55 years or older with a high risk of cardiovascular disease (e.g., those with diabetes, coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, or history of stroke).
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Telmisartan blocks the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that causes blood vessels to constrict. By blocking angiotensin II receptors, telmisartan causes vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), leading to a decrease in blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:** Micardis (brand name)
- **Brand Names:** Micardis, Micardis HCT (telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Telmisartan lowers blood pressure by blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor.  This reduces vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion, which decreases peripheral resistance.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Well absorbed after oral administration.
    - **Metabolism:**  Primarily metabolized by conjugation to form a pharmacologically inactive acylglucuronide. A small portion undergoes oxidative metabolism via CYP2C19.
    - **Elimination:** Mostly excreted in the feces via biliary excretion; a small amount is excreted in the urine.
- **Mode of Action:** Telmisartan selectively binds to the AT1 receptor, preventing angiotensin II from exerting its vasoconstricting effects. 
- **Receptor Binding:**  High affinity and selectivity for the AT1 receptor.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily biliary excretion (feces), some renal excretion (urine).


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Hypertension:** Initial dose: 40 mg orally once daily. Maintenance dose: 20-80 mg orally once daily, adjusted according to blood pressure response.
- **Cardiovascular Risk Reduction:** 80 mg orally once daily.


#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established in this population.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No initial dosage adjustment necessary, but monitor for increased sensitivity.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is generally required, but lower starting dose (20mg) is recommended for severe renal impairment or hemodialysis patients.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment. A lower starting dose of 40 mg is recommended in mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Close monitoring of blood pressure is recommended, especially in patients with heart failure or volume depletion.


### **Clinical Use Cases**  The listed clinical scenarios (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, Emergency Situations) are not the typical use cases for telmisartan. Telmisartan is primarily used for long-term management of hypertension and cardiovascular risk reduction, and it doesn't have specific applications in these acute care settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with renal or hepatic impairment, volume depletion, or those taking interacting medications.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Back pain, sinusitis, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, dizziness, fatigue, and muscle pain.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat, or extremities), hypotension, hyperkalemia (high potassium), acute renal failure, and liver dysfunction.

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Long-term effects of telmisartan are primarily related to its impact on cardiovascular health.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Angioedema, hyperkalemia, hypotension, and renal failure require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to telmisartan, pregnancy (especially second and third trimesters), biliary obstructive disorders, severe hepatic impairment, concomitant use of aliskiren in patients with diabetes or moderate to severe renal impairment.

## **Drug Interactions**

- **Other Antihypertensives:** May have additive effects, leading to hypotension.
- **NSAIDs:** May reduce the antihypertensive effect and increase the risk of renal impairment.
- **Aliskiren:**  Contraindicated in patients with diabetes.
- **Lithium and Digoxin:** Telmisartan may increase serum levels of these drugs.
- **Potassium-sparing Diuretics and Potassium Supplements:** Increased risk of hyperkalemia.
- **CYP2C19 Inhibitors/Inducers:** May alter telmisartan metabolism, requiring dosage adjustments.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** D (second and third trimesters), C (first trimester)
- **Fetal Risks:** May cause fetal harm or death, especially during the second and third trimesters.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Not recommended; safety and efficacy have not been established.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).
- **Side Effects:** Back pain, sinusitis, diarrhea, angioedema, hypotension, hyperkalemia, renal impairment.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, pregnancy, biliary obstruction, severe hepatic impairment, concomitant use with aliskiren in certain patient populations.
- **Drug Interactions:**  Other antihypertensives, NSAIDs, aliskiren, lithium, digoxin, potassium-sparing diuretics.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy, not recommended during breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** 40-80 mg once daily for hypertension; 80 mg once daily for cardiovascular risk reduction.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, potassium levels, renal function.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Telmisartan is often combined with hydrochlorothiazide (a diuretic) for enhanced blood pressure lowering.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Monitor blood pressure, potassium levels, and renal function, especially in patients with pre-existing conditions.
- **Specific Populations:**  Use with caution in pregnancy (avoid in second and third trimesters), breastfeeding (not recommended), and patients with hepatic or renal impairment.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Patients should maintain a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise. Alcohol consumption should be limited.
