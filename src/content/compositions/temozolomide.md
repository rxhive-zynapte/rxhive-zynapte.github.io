## **Usage**

Temozolomide is an alkylating agent indicated for the treatment of:

* **Adults:**
    * Newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) concomitantly with radiotherapy and then as maintenance treatment.
    * Refractory anaplastic astrocytoma who have experienced disease progression on a drug regimen containing nitrosourea and procarbazine.
* **Children (3 years and older):** Malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma, showing recurrence or progression after standard therapy.  It is also used to treat aggressive pituitary tumors and pituitary cancer.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Alkylating antineoplastic agent.

**Mechanism of Action:** Temozolomide is an imidazotetrazine derivative that undergoes rapid chemical conversion at physiologic pH to the active metabolite, monomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide (MTIC). MTIC methylates/alkylates DNA primarily at the N-7 and O-6 positions of guanine. This methylation damages the DNA of tumor cells, leading to cell death.



## **Alternate Names**

- **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Temozolomide
- **Brand Name:** Temodar


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Temozolomide causes DNA damage in tumor cells. The cytotoxicity is believed to be due to alkylation at the O6 position of guanine. Methylation at other DNA sites may also contribute to cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Temozolomide is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration.  Taking it with a high-fat meal may decrease the maximum concentration reached.
* **Distribution:** Widely distributed in the body. Low protein binding suggests minimal interactions with other highly protein-bound medications.
* **Metabolism:** Undergoes spontaneous, non-enzymatic conversion at physiologic pH to its active metabolite, MTIC. Hepatic metabolism is negligible.
* **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion of temozolomide and its metabolites.  A smaller portion of the dose is eliminated via fecal excretion.


**Mode of Action:** Alkylation of DNA, primarily at the O-6 position of guanine.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Does not have any known significant receptor binding or specific enzyme inhibition related to its anticancer action. Its activity is based on direct DNA alkylation.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme:**
    * Concomitant with Radiotherapy: 75 mg/m² orally once daily for 42 days with focal radiotherapy (may extend to 49 days if radiotherapy is interrupted).
    * Maintenance: 150 mg/m² orally once daily on days 1-5 of a 28-day cycle for 6 cycles. The dose may be escalated to 200 mg/m² in subsequent cycles if tolerated.

* **Refractory Anaplastic Astrocytoma:** 150 mg/m² orally once daily on days 1-5 of each 28-day treatment cycle. Subsequent cycles may be increased to 200 mg/m² daily if there is no hematologic toxicity.

* **Metastatic Malignant Melanoma:** 200 mg/m² orally once daily on days 1-5 of a 28-day cycle.

#### **Children:**

* **Malignant Glioma (≥ 3 years):**  200 mg/m² orally once daily for 5 days per 28-day cycle. Previously treated patients may start at 150 mg/m² and escalate to 200 mg/m² in subsequent cycles if tolerated.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Increased risk of myelosuppression. Close monitoring and possible dose adjustments are required.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Close monitoring and possible dose adjustment are necessary for severe renal impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Monitor closely; dose adjustments might be needed for severe hepatic dysfunction. 
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration and dose modification are warranted based on specific conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Temozolomide's primary use is for specific brain tumors and melanoma. It is not indicated for conditions requiring intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose reductions or treatment delays may be necessary based on hematological toxicity (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), other adverse effects, or intercurrent illnesses. Detailed guidelines are available in product information sheets.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Nausea, vomiting, constipation, fatigue, headache, rash, alopecia, myelosuppression (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia), and lymphopenia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP),  myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), secondary malignancies (including myeloid leukemia), tumor lysis syndrome, hepatotoxicity, and severe myelosuppression.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Risk of secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukemia, and infertility.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe myelosuppression, hypersensitivity reactions, severe hepatotoxicity, and PCP.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to temozolomide or dacarbazine. Severe myelosuppression. Pregnancy. Breastfeeding.



## **Drug Interactions**

* **Valproic Acid:** May decrease temozolomide clearance.
* **Myelosuppressive Agents:** Increased risk of myelosuppression.
* **Other Interactions:** Limited data available. Interactions through CYP450 metabolism are unlikely.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

**Pregnancy Safety Category:**  D (US FDA); X (Australian classification)

**Fetal Risks:** Temozolomide is teratogenic and can cause fetal harm. Contraception is mandatory during treatment and for several months after the last dose for both males and females.

**Breastfeeding:** Temozolomide is likely excreted in breast milk. Breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment and for a period after the last dose.
