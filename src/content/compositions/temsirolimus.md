## **Usage**

- Temsirolimus is prescribed for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a type of kidney cancer. It is also used in some cases for other cancers like mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).
- **Pharmacological classification:** Temsirolimus is an antineoplastic agent, specifically a kinase inhibitor targeting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Temsirolimus inhibits mTOR, a key protein kinase regulating cell growth, proliferation, and angiogenesis. By blocking mTOR, temsirolimus disrupts crucial cellular processes necessary for cancer cell survival and tumor growth.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** temsirolimus.
- **Brand Name:** Torisel.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Temsirolimus binds to an intracellular protein (FKBP-12), forming a complex that inhibits mTOR. This leads to downstream effects, suppressing cell growth, proliferation, and angiogenesis, ultimately reducing tumor size and progression.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Administered intravenously, achieving peak plasma concentration at the end of infusion.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 in the liver to sirolimus, its major active metabolite. Temsirolimus also inhibits CYP3A4/5 and CYP2D6.
    - **Elimination:** Predominantly eliminated via feces (78%), with minor renal excretion (4.6%).

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Renal Cell Carcinoma:** 25 mg IV infusion once weekly over 30-60 minutes. Continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Premedication with an antihistamine like diphenhydramine (25-50mg IV) is recommended 30 minutes prior to each infusion to minimize the risk of hypersensitivity reactions.
- **Mantle Cell Lymphoma:**  175 mg IV infusion once weekly for 3 weeks, followed by 75 mg IV infusion weekly. 

#### **Children:**

- Efficacy and safety not fully established. Limited data suggests 75 mg/mÂ² weekly IV infusion has shown some efficacy in certain childhood cancers like neuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma, but further research is needed.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is typically necessary, but they might be more susceptible to certain side effects like edema, diarrhea, and pneumonia.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is usually needed. Caution is advised in severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
    - Mild to moderate hepatic impairment (RCC): Reduce dose to 15 mg weekly.
    - Severe hepatic impairment (RCC): Reduce dose to 10 mg weekly.
    - Mild hepatic impairment (MCL): No dose adjustment.
    - Moderate to severe hepatic impairment (MCL): Contraindicated.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Close monitoring and dose adjustments may be necessary for patients with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and other relevant conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Temsirolimus is primarily used in oncology settings and has no established role in scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are primarily based on hepatic function, adverse effects, and drug interactions.  Dose reduction is necessary when co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. If strong CYP3A4 inducers are used, a higher dose of Temsirolimus might be required. 


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Anemia, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, infections, fatigue, rash, mucositis (mouth sores), edema, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, constipation, headache, insomnia, dyspnea.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions (including anaphylaxis), interstitial lung disease, bowel perforation, renal failure,  pancreatitis, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, angioedema.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Impaired fertility, secondary malignancies (due to immunosuppression), metabolic abnormalities.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Anaphylaxis, severe infections, acute renal failure, interstitial lung disease exacerbations, bowel perforation, severe hyperglycemia/hyperlipidemia.

## **Contraindications**

- Bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN.
- Hypersensitivity to temsirolimus, sirolimus, or polysorbate 80.
- Moderate to severe hepatic impairment for MCL patients.


## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin):** Increase temsirolimus levels. Avoid concomitant use or reduce temsirolimus dose.
- **CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, St. John's Wort):** Decrease temsirolimus levels. Avoid concomitant use or adjust dose.
- **Immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus):** Increase risk of infection. Close monitoring is warranted.
- **Live vaccines:**  Avoid concomitant use due to increased risk of infection.
- **Anticoagulants:** May increase bleeding risk.
- **Grapefruit juice:** May increase temsirolimus levels. Avoid consumption.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Temsirolimus can cause fetal harm and should be avoided during pregnancy. Effective contraception should be used by both male and female patients during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose.
- **Breastfeeding:** Temsirolimus may be excreted in breast milk and can potentially cause harm to nursing infants. Breastfeeding should be avoided during treatment and for 3 weeks after the last dose.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** mTOR inhibitor, suppressing cell growth, proliferation, and angiogenesis.
- **Side Effects:** Anemia, hyperglycemia, infections, fatigue, rash, mucositis, edema. Serious side effects include hypersensitivity reactions, interstitial lung disease, and renal failure.
- **Contraindications:** Bilirubin >1.5 x ULN, hypersensitivity to temsirolimus or sirolimus.
- **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers, immunosuppressants, live vaccines.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Avoid use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** 25 mg IV weekly for RCC; 175mg IV weekly for 3 weeks followed by 75 mg IV weekly for MCL.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood counts, glucose and lipid profiles, renal and liver function tests, signs of infection, respiratory symptoms.

## **Popular Combinations**

- No established "popular combinations" for routine use. Combination regimens are often specific to certain cancers and clinical trials.

## **Precautions**

- Pre-screening for hepatic and renal function, hypersensitivity to temsirolimus or sirolimus. Monitor for infections, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, respiratory symptoms.
- **Pregnant Women:** Avoid use.
- **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Avoid use.
- **Children & Elderly:** Monitor closely for side effects.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid grapefruit juice. Caution with alcohol consumption.
