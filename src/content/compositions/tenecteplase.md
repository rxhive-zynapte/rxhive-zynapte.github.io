## **Usage**

Tenecteplase is prescribed for the reduction of mortality associated with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), particularly ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).  It is also used in some instances, though off-label, for acute ischemic stroke and acute massive pulmonary embolism. It is classified as a thrombolytic agent.  Tenecteplase works by activating plasminogen, which subsequently converts to plasmin. Plasmin is an enzyme that breaks down fibrin, the primary component of blood clots. By breaking down fibrin, tenecteplase helps to restore blood flow in blocked arteries.

## **Alternate Names**

Tenecteplase is also known as TNK-tPA.  Brand names include TNKase® and Metalyse®.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Tenecteplase promotes thrombolysis (breakdown of blood clots) by catalyzing the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin then degrades fibrin, the main protein component of thrombi. Compared to alteplase, tenecteplase has a higher fibrin specificity, greater resistance to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and a longer half-life.  

**Pharmacokinetics:** Administered as an intravenous bolus, tenecteplase is primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism and has a half-life of 20 to 25 minutes. It exhibits dose-proportional pharmacokinetics.

**Mode of Action:** Tenecteplase binds to fibrin within the thrombus, activating plasminogen to plasmin, which then degrades the fibrin matrix of the clot. This fibrin-specific action limits systemic plasmin generation compared to other thrombolytic agents.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Tenecteplase is primarily cleared by the liver.  It is minimally excreted renally.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

For Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI/STEMI): Administer as a single intravenous bolus over 5 seconds based on the patient's weight:

* <60 kg: 30 mg 
* 60 to <70 kg: 35 mg
* 70 to <80 kg: 40 mg
* 80 to <90 kg: 45 mg
* ≥90 kg: 50 mg (maximum dose)

For acute ischemic stroke (off-label): 0.25 mg/kg as a single intravenous bolus (maximum dose 25 mg).

For acute massive pulmonary embolism: Weight-based dosing as for AMI.

#### **Children:**  

The safety and efficacy of tenecteplase in pediatric patients have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients (≥75 years):** Consider reducing the dose for AMI due to increased bleeding risk.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is typically necessary as renal clearance is minimal.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Limited data are available, and caution is advised. Dose adjustment may be necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Evaluate bleeding risk carefully, particularly in patients with a history of bleeding or trauma.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing recommendations for specific clinical use cases align with the standard adult dosing outlined above.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dose modifications should be made based on patient-specific factors like age (elderly), hepatic impairment, and bleeding risk.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Bleeding (including at the injection site), nausea, vomiting, fever.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Intracranial hemorrhage, stroke, allergic reactions (anaphylaxis, angioedema), hypotension, arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

No specific long-term side effects have been identified for a single dose administration as indicated for AMI. Repeated use is generally not recommended.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Serious bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage and gastrointestinal bleeding; allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis; and stroke require urgent medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

* Active internal bleeding
* History of cerebrovascular accident
* Recent intracranial or intraspinal surgery or trauma (within 2 months)
* Intracranial neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation, or aneurysm
* Known bleeding diathesis
* Severe uncontrolled hypertension

## **Drug Interactions**

Tenecteplase interacts with anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, direct oral anticoagulants), antiplatelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel), and other medications affecting coagulation.  These interactions can increase the risk of bleeding.  Consult a drug interaction database for a complete list.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Tenecteplase is a Pregnancy Category C drug (FDA).  Animal studies have shown adverse effects. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Use only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.

It is unknown whether tenecteplase is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, breastfeeding should be discontinued for the first 24 hours after thrombolytic therapy.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Activates plasminogen to plasmin, leading to fibrinolysis and thrombolysis.
* **Side Effects:** Bleeding, nausea, vomiting, fever. Serious side effects: intracranial hemorrhage, stroke, allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Active bleeding, history of stroke, recent intracranial surgery/trauma, intracranial neoplasm/AVM/aneurysm, bleeding diathesis, severe uncontrolled hypertension.
* **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category C; use with caution. Discontinue breastfeeding for 24 hours post-administration.
* **Dosage:** Weight-based, single IV bolus, max 50 mg for AMI/PE; 0.25 mg/kg, max 25 mg for stroke (off-label).
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Signs of bleeding, neurological status, blood pressure, heart rate, ECG.

## **Popular Combinations**

Tenecteplase is commonly administered with antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin) and anticoagulants (e.g., heparin) as part of AMI management.

## **Precautions**

Standard precautions include monitoring for bleeding complications, allergic reactions, and changes in neurological status. Caution should be used in elderly patients and those with hepatic impairment.
