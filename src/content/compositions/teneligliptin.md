## **Usage**

- Teneligliptin is prescribed for **Type 2 diabetes mellitus** in adults. It is used as monotherapy when metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, or in combination with other antidiabetic agents (e.g., metformin, pioglitazone, sulfonylureas, glinides, α-glucosidase inhibitors) and/or insulin when these, along with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycemic control.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, Antidiabetic agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Teneligliptin works by inhibiting the enzyme DPP-4.  This enzyme breaks down incretin hormones like GLP-1 and GIP, which play a crucial role in glucose regulation by increasing insulin release and decreasing glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. By inhibiting DPP-4, teneligliptin increases and prolongs the action of these incretin hormones, thereby improving glycemic control.

## **Alternate Names**

- It is known as Teneligliptin Hydrobromide Hydrate in some contexts.
- **Brand Names:** Tilyptin, Glipten, Ten-20, Olymprix, TENEBLU, Tenelisign, Olymprix M (combination with Metformin).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Teneligliptin primarily exerts its glucose-lowering effect by inhibiting DPP-4. This leads to increased and prolonged levels of active incretin hormones, GLP-1 and GIP. These hormones stimulate glucose-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells and suppress glucagon secretion from alpha-cells. The glucose-dependent nature of this mechanism minimizes the risk of hypoglycemia.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Teneligliptin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations in about 1-2 hours. It is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and FMO3 enzymes in the liver, with minor contributions from CYP2D6 and FMO1. The metabolites are eliminated via both renal and hepatic routes.  Renal impairment does not require dose adjustment.
- **Mode of Action:**  Teneligliptin competitively binds to and inhibits the active site of the DPP-4 enzyme, preventing the cleavage of incretin hormones.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Teneligliptin specifically inhibits the DPP-4 enzyme.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Teneligliptin is eliminated through both renal and hepatic pathways following metabolism primarily by CYP3A4 and FMO3.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- Initial dose: 20 mg orally once daily, with or without food.
- Maintenance dose: If the initial dose is insufficient, it can be increased to a maximum of 40 mg orally once daily.

#### **Children:**
- The safety and efficacy of teneligliptin have not been established in pediatric patients. It is not recommended for use in this population.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment is generally not required. However, caution is advised due to potential age-related physiological decline.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment is not required for mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  Use with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment as safety and efficacy have not been established.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with congestive heart failure, history of arrhythmia, bradycardia, low serum potassium, QT prolongation, or those taking other medications affecting QT interval. Caution is also needed in patients with pituitary/adrenal insufficiency, bowel obstruction, or excessive alcohol intake.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Teneligliptin is not indicated for use in clinical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its usage is specifically for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based primarily on efficacy and tolerability. If 20 mg/day is insufficient to achieve target glycemic control, the dose can be increased to a maximum of 40 mg/day.
