## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is prescribed for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and children 2 years and older (in combination with other antiretroviral agents) and chronic hepatitis B (HBV) infection in adults and children 2 years and older.  
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antiretroviral, Nucleoside/Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NRTI).
- **Mechanism of Action:** TDF is a prodrug that is metabolized to tenofovir. Tenofovir then inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and HBV polymerase by competing with the natural substrate deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate and by causing DNA chain termination after incorporation into DNA.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
- **Brand Names:** Viread, Vemlidy (Tenofovir alafenamide - a related prodrug)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is converted to tenofovir, its active metabolite.  Tenofovir diphosphate, the active intracellular metabolite, inhibits HIV reverse transcriptase and HBV polymerase, blocking viral replication.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** TDF is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, and food enhances its bioavailability.
    - **Metabolism:** TDF is hydrolyzed to tenofovir, which is intracellularly phosphorylated to the active metabolite, tenofovir diphosphate.
    - **Elimination:** Tenofovir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys via glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion.


- **Mode of Action:** Tenofovir diphosphate competes with deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate for incorporation into viral DNA.  Once incorporated, it acts as a chain terminator, halting further DNA synthesis.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits reverse transcriptase in HIV and polymerase in HBV.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion (glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion).

## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults (HIV and HBV):**

- 300 mg orally once daily with food.


#### **Children (HIV and HBV, 2 years and older):**

- 8 mg/kg orally once daily (up to a maximum of 300 mg), administered as oral powder or tablets.
-  Dose adjustments are necessary for children weighing less than 35 kg.
- **Children younger than 2 years:** Use and dose must be determined by the physician. Pediatric safety and efficacy have not been established in this group.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to the potential for age-related decline in renal function.  Monitor renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment is required based on creatinine clearance.
   - CrCl 50-80 mL/min: No adjustment needed (monitor renal function).
   - CrCl 30-49 mL/min: 300 mg every 48 hours.
   - CrCl 10-29 mL/min: 300 mg every 72-96 hours.
   - Hemodialysis: 300 mg every 7 days following dialysis.
   - CrCl < 10 mL/min (not on hemodialysis): Not recommended.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dosage adjustment is required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring is necessary, particularly for those with diabetes, bone disease, or other conditions that may impact renal function.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  
TDF is indicated for chronic management of HIV and HBV, not for acute conditions like those listed.  It has no role in intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations such as status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Adjust dosage based on creatinine clearance as outlined in the "Special Cases" section above.
- For patients with drug interactions that may affect tenofovir concentrations or renal function, consider dose adjustments and close monitoring.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
- Headache, dizziness
- Fatigue, weakness
- Rash, itching

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
- Lactic acidosis (buildup of lactic acid in the blood)
- Severe hepatomegaly with steatosis (enlarged liver with fat accumulation)
- Renal impairment, including Fanconi syndrome (a type of kidney damage)
- Decreased bone mineral density

### **Long-Term Effects:**
- Chronic kidney disease
- Osteoporosis and increased risk of fractures

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
- Hypersensitivity reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
- Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in HIV patients


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or any component of the formulation.



## **Drug Interactions**

- **Nephrotoxic drugs:** Increased risk of renal toxicity (e.g. Cidofovir, aminoglycosides, high-dose or multiple NSAIDs).
- **Drugs that reduce renal function:** May increase tenofovir concentrations.
- **Didanosine:** Increases didanosine concentrations, leading to increased risk of didanosine-related toxicity.
- **Atazanavir and lopinavir/ritonavir:** May decrease tenofovir concentrations.
- **Other antiretrovirals:** Potential for additive or synergistic antiviral activity.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** B
- **Fetal Risks:** Potential for fetal growth restriction and preterm birth. No increased risk of congenital anomalies.
- **Breastfeeding:** Tenofovir is present in breast milk.  Breastfeeding is generally not recommended due to potential for HIV transmission.
- Alternative safer options may be considered if breastfeeding is desired.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Nucleoside/Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NRTI) that inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and HBV polymerase, preventing viral replication.
