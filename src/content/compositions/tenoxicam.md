      How does Tenoxicam compare to other NSAIDs?**


      **A:**  Tenoxicam has a longer half-life than many other NSAIDs, allowing

      advantages in terms of GI tolerability compared to non-selective NSAIDs,
      but it still carries significant GI risks.

## **Usage**

Tenoxicam is prescribed for the symptomatic relief of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other musculoskeletal disorders like tendinitis, bursitis, and periarthritis. It can also be used for post-operative pain, acute gout, and primary dysmenorrhea.  Its pharmacological classification is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Tenoxicam works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, primarily COX-2. This reduces the production of prostaglandins, which are key mediators of inflammation and pain.

## **Alternate Names**

While Tenoxicam is the generic name, it's marketed under various brand names like Tilcotil, Tilatil, Tilcitin, Alganex, Mobiflex, and Reutenox.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Tenoxicam exerts its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects primarily through the inhibition of COX-2, thus reducing prostaglandin synthesis. It exhibits a long duration of action due to its long half-life.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:** Tenoxicam is well-absorbed orally, with near 100% bioavailability.  Taking it with food can delay absorption but does not affect the overall extent of absorption.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver, mainly via hydroxylation to inactive metabolites.
* **Elimination:**  Tenoxicam has a long elimination half-life of approximately 72 hours, primarily eliminated through renal excretion of metabolites.

**Mode of Action:**  Tenoxicam binds to and inhibits COX enzymes, preventing arachidonic acid from being converted into prostaglandins. This inhibition reduces inflammation and pain.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Primarily inhibits COX-2 enzyme.

**Elimination Pathways:** Excreted renally as metabolites, with a small amount excreted through the biliary route.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  A single daily dose of 20 mg taken orally, preferably with or after food.  For some conditions, like postoperative pain or acute gout, the dose can be temporarily increased to 40 mg daily as directed by a physician. The smallest effective dose should be used.

#### **Children:** Not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years due to a lack of adequate safety and efficacy data.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start at a lower dose (e.g., 10 mg) and increase cautiously as needed, due to the increased risk of side effects. Monitor closely for adverse events.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce dosage as needed based on renal function. Careful monitoring of renal function is recommended.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustment is necessary, minimizing the dose in patients with hepatic impairment. Contraindicated in severe hepatic dysfunction.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use cautiously in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, or a history of gastrointestinal ulcers or bleeding. Consider gastroprotective agents (e.g., misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors) for patients with increased GI risk.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The standard 20 mg daily dosage typically applies to most clinical settings. In cases of post-operative pain, a higher dose of 40 mg daily for up to 5 days may be employed.  No specific dosage adjustments are typically recommended for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations, but clinical judgment is paramount. Start with the lowest effective dose and titrate upwards as needed based on patient response and tolerance.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are crucial for elderly patients and those with renal or hepatic impairment. Closely monitor patients with these conditions for adverse events and adjust dosage accordingly.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**
Dyspepsia, nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, flatulence, dizziness, headache, edema, and skin rash.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcers, perforation, anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, renal impairment, hepatic dysfunction, cardiovascular events (e.g., myocardial infarction, stroke), blood disorders (e.g., thrombocytopenia, leukopenia), and angioedema.

### **Long-Term Effects:**
Chronic use can potentially lead to renal or hepatic damage, cardiovascular complications, and gastrointestinal issues.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
Any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or ulceration, skin reactions, hepatic or renal dysfunction, or cardiovascular events should be considered serious ADRs requiring immediate medical attention.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to tenoxicam or any NSAIDs.
* History of asthma, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs.
* Active peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Severe heart failure.
* Severe hepatic impairment.
* Third trimester of pregnancy.
* Perioperative pain in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

## **Drug Interactions**

Tenoxicam can interact with numerous medications, including:
* Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin): Increased risk of bleeding.
* Antihypertensives: May decrease their effectiveness.
* Lithium: Increased lithium levels.
* Methotrexate: Enhanced methotrexate toxicity.
* Diuretics: May reduce diuretic efficacy.
* Other NSAIDs and salicylates: Increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects.
* Corticosteroids: Increased risk of gastrointestinal ulceration.
* SSRIs: Increased risk of GI bleeding.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Tenoxicam is contraindicated during the third trimester due to the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and potential complications during labor. Use with caution during the first and second trimesters, as NSAIDs can cause fetal renal dysfunction.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Tenoxicam passes into breast milk.  It's generally recommended to avoid its use during breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  COX-2 inhibitor, reducing prostaglandin synthesis.
* **Side Effects:**  GI upset, dizziness, headache; rarely, GI bleeding, ulcers, Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to NSAIDs, active peptic ulcer, severe hepatic/heart failure, third-trimester pregnancy.
* **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, antihypertensives, lithium, methotrexate, other NSAIDs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid in third trimester and during breastfeeding.  Use cautiously in the first and second trimesters.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 20 mg once daily; up to 40 mg for certain conditions.  Not for children under 18.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Renal function, liver function tests, blood pressure, signs of GI bleeding.

## **Popular Combinations**

While not a "combination drug," tenoxicam may be prescribed along with gastroprotective agents (e.g., misoprostol, proton pump inhibitors) to minimize gastrointestinal risks, particularly in patients with risk factors.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess for allergies, renal/hepatic function, and cardiovascular risk factors.
* **Specific Populations:** See "Dosage - Special Cases."
* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Avoid or limit alcohol consumption.  Caution while driving or operating machinery due to potential dizziness or drowsiness.
