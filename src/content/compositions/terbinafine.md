      What should I do if a patient develops a rash while taking Terbinafine?**


      **A:** Evaluate the rash. If it's mild, it may be managed
      symptomatically.  If it's severe or suggestive of a serious skin reaction
      (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome), discontinue Terbinafine immediately and
      refer to a dermatologist.

      How is Terbinafine different from other antifungals?**


      **A:** Terbinafine belongs to the allylamine class and has a unique
      mechanism of action compared to azoles like itraconazole or fluconazole.
      It specifically targets squalene epoxidase. It tends to have good
      penetration into keratinized tissues like skin and nails.

## **Usage**

Terbinafine is an antifungal medication primarily prescribed for the treatment of fungal infections affecting the skin, hair, and nails. These include:

* **Onychomycosis:**  Fungal infection of the fingernails or toenails (tinea unguium).
* **Tinea corporis:** Ringworm of the body.
* **Tinea cruris:** Jock itch (ringworm of the groin).
* **Tinea pedis:** Athlete's foot (ringworm of the foot).
* **Tinea capitis:**  Ringworm of the scalp (primarily in children).

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Antifungal (allylamine class)

**Mechanism of Action:** Terbinafine inhibits squalene epoxidase, a fungal enzyme essential for ergosterol synthesis. Ergosterol is a crucial component of the fungal cell membrane. Disruption of ergosterol biosynthesis leads to increased membrane permeability, causing fungal cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

While "terbinafine" is the generic name, it is marketed under various brand names, including Lamisil,  Terbinex and Deolate.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Terbinafine accumulates in the keratin precursor cells of the skin, hair, and nails, achieving fungicidal concentrations. It disrupts fungal cell membrane integrity by inhibiting squalene epoxidase.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Well-absorbed orally, with bioavailability around 80%. Food does not significantly affect absorption.
* **Distribution:**  Highly lipophilic and distributes extensively into skin, nails, and adipose tissue.
* **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6, 1A2, 3A4, and 2C9 enzymes.
* **Elimination:** Excreted mainly in urine and feces.

**Mode of Action:**

Terbinafine acts by inhibiting squalene epoxidase in the fungal cell membrane. This enzyme is essential in the biosynthesis of ergosterol, a vital component of fungal cell membranes. The inhibition of squalene epoxidase leads to:

1. **Depletion of ergosterol:** Compromising the structural integrity and function of the fungal cell membrane.
2. **Accumulation of squalene:**  Further disrupting membrane function and leading to fungal cell death.

Terbinafine does not affect human steroid hormone synthesis.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Onychomycosis:** 250 mg orally once daily. Fingernails: 6 weeks; Toenails: 12 weeks.
* **Tinea corporis/cruris/pedis:** 250 mg orally once daily for 2-6 weeks, depending on the infection site and severity.
* **Tinea capitis:** 250 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks.

#### **Children:**

Dosing is based on body weight:

* **&lt;20 kg:** 62.5 mg daily.
* **20-40 kg:** 125 mg daily.
* **&gt;40 kg:** 250 mg daily.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments unless renal or hepatic impairment is present.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment (CrCl <50 mL/min):** Dose reduction to 125 mg daily is recommended. Avoid use if CrCl <20 mL/min.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in patients with chronic or active liver disease.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Monitor for potential drug interactions, particularly with drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes.  Caution advised in patients with pre-existing autoimmune conditions like lupus.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Terbinafine's clinical use is primarily focused on the treatment of fungal infections.  It's not typically used in the clinical settings mentioned (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations).



## **Side Effects**



### **Common Side Effects:**

Headache, gastrointestinal upset (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain), rash, taste disturbance, and altered sense of smell.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe liver injury (hepatotoxicity), including liver failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome, neutropenia, angioedema, and anaphylaxis.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term effects are rare with typical treatment durations. Monitor for persistent taste or smell disturbances.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Any signs of hepatotoxicity (jaundice, dark urine, right upper quadrant pain), severe skin reactions, or blood dyscrasias require immediate discontinuation of terbinafine and prompt medical evaluation.


## **Contraindications**

* Chronic or active liver disease.
* Hypersensitivity to terbinafine.


## **Drug Interactions**

Terbinafine is metabolized by several CYP450 enzymes (mainly CYP2D6, 1A2, 3A4, and 2C9).  It can interact with drugs that inhibit or induce these enzymes:

* **CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine):**  May increase terbinafine levels.
* **CYP2D6 inducers (e.g., rifampin):** May decrease terbinafine levels.
* **Cimetidine:** May increase terbinafine levels.
* **Rifampin:** May decrease terbinafine levels.

Also consider interactions with:

* **Caffeine:** Terbinafine may increase caffeine levels.
* **Ciclosporin:** Terbinafine may increase ciclosporin levels.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Terbinafine is classified as Pregnancy Category B.  Limited human data suggest no major fetal risks, but use only if clearly needed.
* **Breastfeeding:** Terbinafine is excreted in breast milk.  Potential risks to the infant are unknown.  Consider alternative antifungals or discontinue breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits squalene epoxidase, disrupting fungal cell membrane synthesis.
* **Side Effects:** Headache, GI upset, rash, taste/smell disturbances; rarely, hepatotoxicity, severe skin reactions.
* **Contraindications:**  Chronic/active liver disease, hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:**  CYP2D6 and other CYP enzyme inhibitors/inducers; cimetidine, rifampin, caffeine, ciclosporin.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 250 mg/day; Pediatrics: weight-based dosing;  adjust for renal impairment.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests (baseline and periodically during treatment), complete blood count (if indicated).


## **Popular Combinations**

Terbinafine is generally used as monotherapy.  Topical antifungals may be used concomitantly for onychomycosis.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess liver function before starting treatment. Monitor for adverse effects.
* **Specific Populations:** See above in "Special Cases"
