## **Usage**

- Terizidone is a second-line antituberculosis drug prescribed for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. It is used in combination with other anti-TB medications when first-line drugs are ineffective due to resistance or intolerance.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Antituberculosis drug, specifically a structural analog of cycloserine.
- **Mechanism of action:** Terizidone is a prodrug of cycloserine. It is hydrolyzed to cycloserine and para-phthalate in the body. Cycloserine inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by interfering with the formation of D-alanine and its incorporation into the peptidoglycan layer.  It acts by inhibiting two enzymes, alanine racemase and D-alanyl-D-alanine synthetase, essential for peptidoglycan synthesis.


## **Alternate Names**

- Terizidon
- Cycloserine dimer
-  No widely recognized international variations.
- Brand names (examples):  Terizidon, Terizidone Macleods


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Terizidone exerts its antibacterial effect by inhibiting cell wall synthesis, specifically peptidoglycan synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Terizidone is administered orally. High-fat meals can delay and reduce the drug's absorption. 
    - **Metabolism:** Terizidone is a prodrug that is hydrolyzed to its active metabolite cycloserine. 
    - **Elimination:** Cycloserine is primarily eliminated through renal excretion. Dose adjustments are necessary in patients with renal impairment.

- **Mode of action:** Terizidone is hydrolyzed to cycloserine, which then inhibits two key enzymes, alanine racemase, and D-alanyl-D-alanine synthetase involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis in bacterial cell walls. 
- **Receptor binding/enzyme inhibition:** Cycloserine inhibits alanine racemase and D-alanyl-D-alanine synthetase.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 750-1000 mg/day, administered in 3 or 4 divided doses, with or without food.
- Maximum daily dose: 1000 mg.

#### **Children:**

- 10-20 mg/kg/day, administered in two divided doses every 12 hours or once daily if tolerated.
- Maximum daily dose: 1000 mg.
- For children unable to swallow capsules, the contents can be dissolved in 10 ml of water.
- Pediatric safety considerations: Monitor closely for central nervous system toxicity.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Caution is advised; dose adjustments may be necessary due to age-related decline in renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction is required for patients with creatinine clearance <30 ml/min (250 mg once daily or 500 mg three times a week, administered after dialysis).
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific dose adjustments are necessary, but monitor closely for signs of toxicity.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with pre-existing neurological or psychiatric conditions.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosage recommendations for terizidone are consistent across various clinical settings in which it might be used as part of a multidrug regimen for MDR-TB. There are no specific dosage modifications for Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, or Emergency Situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments based on creatinine clearance are essential.
- Therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to maintain peak serum cycloserine concentrations below 35 Âµg/ml.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Headache, dizziness, drowsiness, insomnia, tremor, nervousness, irritability, difficulty speaking, numbness or tingling in extremities.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Seizures, psychosis, depression, suicidal ideation, allergic dermatitis, hypersensitivity reactions,  peripheral neuropathy.


### **Long-Term Effects**

- Chronic neurological or psychiatric complications are possible with prolonged use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Neurotoxicity (seizures, psychosis, depression) and hypersensitivity reactions require immediate intervention.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to terizidone or cycloserine.
- Epilepsy, severe depression, psychosis, severe anxiety, chronic alcoholism, severe renal impairment.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Alcohol, isoniazid, ethionamide: Increased risk of neurotoxicity.
- Medications affecting the central nervous system (antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants): Exacerbation of neurological side effects.
- High-fat meals: Decreased terizidone absorption.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Limited human data available.
- Use only if potential benefits outweigh the risks to the fetus.
- Terizidone is excreted in breast milk.  Supplementation with pyridoxine is recommended for both mother and infant.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis.
- **Side Effects:** Headache, dizziness, drowsiness, seizures, psychosis, depression.
- **Contraindications:** Epilepsy, psychosis, severe renal impairment, alcoholism.
- **Drug Interactions:** Alcohol, isoniazid, ethionamide, CNS-active drugs.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks; monitor infant.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 750-1000 mg/day; Children: 10-20 mg/kg/day.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Cycloserine serum concentrations, renal function, neurological and psychiatric status.

## **Popular Combinations**

Terizidone is typically used in combination with other second-line anti-TB drugs based on susceptibility testing.


## **Precautions**

- Pre-screening for renal function, neurological/psychiatric conditions, and alcohol abuse is essential.
- Co-administration of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is recommended to prevent neurological side effects (50 mg of pyridoxine for every 250 mg of terizidone).
