      Are there any significant drug interactions with Terlipressin?**


      **A:** Yes. Terlipressin can interact with non-selective beta-blockers,
      drugs that prolong the QT interval (like certain antiarrhythmics and
      antibiotics), and medications causing hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. 
      Concomitant use with other bradycardic agents should also be avoided.

## **Usage**

- Terlipressin is prescribed for the treatment of bleeding esophageal varices, hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS-1), and in some cases, other types of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis.  It is sometimes used as an adjuvant therapy to endoscopic hemostasis in the case of esophageal varices.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Vasoconstrictor,  synthetic analog of vasopressin.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Terlipressin is a prodrug of lysine vasopressin (LVP). It causes vasoconstriction of the splanchnic arterial bed, reducing portal venous pressure, which helps control bleeding from esophageal varices. It also improves renal perfusion in HRS-1.

## **Alternate Names**

- **Generic Name:** Terlipressin acetate
- **Brand Names:** Glypressin, Terlivaz

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Terlipressin causes vasoconstriction primarily in the splanchnic circulation, leading to reduced portal hypertension.  It also has some antidiuretic effects, though less potent than vasopressin. In HRS-1, improved renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are observed.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Administered intravenously, it is metabolized to LVP by tissue peptidases. LVP has a short half-life (approximately 4-6 hours).
- **Mode of Action:** Binds to V1 receptors in vascular smooth muscle, leading to vasoconstriction.
- **Receptor Binding:** Primarily V1 receptor agonist.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Metabolized by ubiquitous peptidases; does not rely on specific CYP enzymes. Excretion is primarily renal.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Bleeding Esophageal Varices:** Initially 1-2 mg IV every 4-6 hours, depending on the patient’s body weight, until bleeding is controlled (up to 48 hours).  Dose may be reduced to 1 mg every 4-6 hours for patients <50kg, if adverse effects occur. Some sources suggest subsequent doses can be 1mg q4-6h for all adults and durations as long as 72 hours. Continuous infusion of 2-12 mg terlipressin acetate per 24 hours can also be considered.
- **HRS-1:** 1 mg IV every 4-6 hours; may be increased up to 2 mg every 4-6 hours if serum creatinine does not decrease by at least 25% after 3 days. Maximum treatment duration is 14 days. Continuous infusion is an option beginning at 2 mg/24 hours and titrating to 12 mg/24 hours if needed.  This route might offer a better adverse effects profile.

#### **Children:**

- No established pediatric dosing guidelines. Use with extreme caution, considering limited experience in pediatric populations.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to limited experience and potential for increased sensitivity to cardiovascular side effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution in advanced renal dysfunction (serum creatinine ≥ 442 μmol/L), but may still be used if benefits outweigh risks.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment typically required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution in those with uncontrolled hypertension, asthma/COPD, cardiac disease, arrhythmias, or vascular disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage is primarily determined by the indication (esophageal variceal bleeding or HRS-1) as described above. Its usage may also be indicated for acute variceal bleeding if endoscopic therapy is not immediately available. It may be employed in cases where endoscopic treatment has failed to resolve the variceal bleeding.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

As detailed in the "Standard Dosage" and "Special Cases" sections.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, dyspnea, headache, bradycardia, ischemia-related events, pallor, hypertension, hypotension, fluid overload, pleural effusion.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Respiratory failure, intestinal ischemia, ventricular arrhythmias (including Torsade de pointes), cutaneous ischemia and necrosis, hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, bronchospasm, seizures, uterine ischemia.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic complications are not typically seen, as terlipressin is used for short-term treatment. However, prolonged use may exacerbate underlying cardiovascular or respiratory issues.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe circulatory adverse effects,  cardiac ischemia, cerebrovascular ischemia, peripheral ischemia.

## **Contraindications**

- Absolute: Hypersensitivity to terlipressin, pregnancy, unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction, septic shock with low cardiac output, ongoing coronary, peripheral or mesenteric ischemia, hypoxia/worsening respiratory symptoms.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Non-selective beta-blockers: Increased hypotensive effect on the portal vein.
- Drugs prolonging the QT interval (e.g., Class IA and III antiarrhythmics, erythromycin, certain antihistamines and tricyclic antidepressants): Increased risk of Torsade de pointes.
- Medications that cause hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia (e.g., some diuretics): Increased risk of Torsade de pointes.
- Medications with known bradycardic effects (e.g., propofol, sufentanil): Increased bradycardia.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Contraindicated (Category D - Australia, unclassified - USA).  May cause uterine contractions, increased intrauterine pressure, and decreased uterine blood flow.  Embryotoxic and teratogenic in animal studies.
- **Breastfeeding:** Unknown if excreted in breast milk.  Not recommended during breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Prodrug converted to lysine vasopressin, causing splanchnic vasoconstriction and reduced portal pressure.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Monitor vital signs, renal function, electrolytes.  Screen for cardiac, respiratory, and vascular diseases.
- **Specific Populations:**  Use with caution in elderly patients and those with renal impairment. Contraindicated in pregnancy.
