## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Testosterone Decanoate is prescribed for testosterone replacement therapy in males with hypogonadism (low testosterone levels) where the deficiency has been confirmed by clinical features and biochemical tests.  It is also used as supportive therapy for female-to-male transsexuals for masculinization.  Additionally, it might be indicated for osteoporosis caused by androgen deficiency in men.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Androgen, anabolic steroid.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Testosterone Decanoate converts to testosterone in the body. Testosterone exerts its effects by binding to androgen receptors in target tissues. This leads to increased protein synthesis, promoting the development and maintenance of male secondary sexual characteristics (e.g., increased muscle mass, bone density, and hair growth). It also influences sexual function and libido.

## **Alternate Names**

-  It is one of the testosterone esters combined in Sustanon 250.
-  **Brand Names:** Sustanon 250, Reandron 1000. (Please be aware that available brands can vary depending on the region).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Testosterone Decanoate is a long-acting prodrug of testosterone. After intramuscular injection, it is slowly released and hydrolyzed to testosterone. Testosterone then binds to androgen receptors, influencing gene expression in target tissues like muscle, bone, and reproductive organs. This results in anabolic effects (tissue growth) and androgenic effects (development of male characteristics).
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Absorbed slowly from the oily injection site, providing sustained testosterone levels.
    - **Metabolism:** Converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and estradiol.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily excreted in urine as conjugated metabolites. Some elimination occurs through feces.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Hypogonadism:** Usually, 1 mL (250 mg of combined testosterone esters, including 100 mg of testosterone decanoate as part of Sustanon 250) intramuscularly every 3 weeks.  For Reandron 1000, it's 1000 mg/4 mL intramuscularly every 10 to 14 weeks.
- **Female-to-Male Transsexuals:** Varies based on individual needs and recommendations from specialized centers, ranging from 1 mL intramuscularly every 2 to 4 weeks.

#### **Children:**

- Not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Limited data suggests no specific dose adjustments are necessary. Clinical judgment is essential.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No formal studies exist. Caution is advised.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No formal studies exist. Contraindicated in patients with current or past liver tumors.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution in patients with cardiovascular diseases (e.g., heart failure, high blood pressure), as testosterone can cause fluid retention. Also, caution is required in patients with sleep apnea, BPH, hypercalcemia, diabetes, depression, and lung disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Testosterone Decanoate is not typically used for acute management in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. It's indicated for long-term hormonal replacement, not acute interventions.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage should be individualized based on patient response and serum testosterone levels. Monitor levels regularly, especially when adjusting dosages.
