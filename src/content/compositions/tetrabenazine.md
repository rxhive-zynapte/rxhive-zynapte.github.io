      What is the role of CYP2D6 in Tetrabenazine metabolism?**

      **A:** Tetrabenazine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. Patients with
      poor CYP2D6 metabolism or taking concomitant CYP2D6 inhibitors require
      lower doses of tetrabenazine. Genotyping is recommended for patients
      needing doses above 50 mg/day.

## **Usage**

- Tetrabenazine is prescribed for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease.  Huntington's disease is a rare, inherited disease that causes the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Tetrabenazine depletes monoamines, such as dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and histamine, in the central nervous system by reversibly binding to VMAT2. This helps control involuntary body movements (chorea) associated with Huntington's disease.

## **Alternate Names**

-  No alternate generic names are commonly used.
- **Brand Name:** Xenazine

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Tetrabenazine primarily affects the central nervous system by depleting monoamines, leading to a reduction in chorea.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Tetrabenazine is well-absorbed orally.
    - **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver primarily via CYP2D6.  Two active metabolites, alpha-dihydrotetrabenazine (alpha-HTBZ) and beta-dihydrotetrabenazine (beta-HTBZ), are formed.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily via the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:** Tetrabenazine reversibly binds to VMAT2, inhibiting the transport of monoamines into synaptic vesicles, thus depleting monoamine stores.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  VMAT2 inhibition.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of metabolites.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Initial:** 12.5 mg/day orally, given as a single dose in the morning.
- **Titration:** Increase dose by 12.5 mg every 3 or 4 days, or weekly, until the desired effect is achieved, side effects become intolerable, or the total daily dose reaches the maximum recommended dosage.
- **Usual Range:** 25-100 mg/day (maximum recommended dosage).
- **Frequency:** Doses over 37.5 mg/day should be divided into two or three doses per day; no single dose should exceed 25 mg initially.
- **CYP2D6 Genotyping:**  Recommended for patients requiring doses greater than 50 mg/day to determine appropriate dosage adjustments.


#### **Children:**

- No established dosing guidelines for children; use with caution and under close monitoring by a specialist.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start at a low dose and titrate cautiously.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustments are formally recommended, but close monitoring for adverse effects is warranted.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with depression or suicidal ideation, cardiovascular disease (especially QTc prolongation), Parkinson's disease, or those taking drugs that prolong the QTc interval.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Tetrabenazine is specifically indicated for chorea associated with Huntington's disease. It is not typically used in the clinical settings listed (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, emergency situations).

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- **CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers:** Maximum single dose of 25 mg and a maximum daily dose of 50 mg.
- **Concomitant CYP2D6 Inhibitors:**  Maximum daily dose of 50 mg and a maximum single dose not to exceed 25 mg if administered with a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor.
