## **Usage**

- Tetrachlorodecaoxygen anion (TCDO) is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of wound infections. It is also used to promote wound healing.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Skin antiseptic and disinfectant.
- **Mechanism of action:** TCDO kills bacteria and increases oxygen supply to the affected site, stimulating wound healing. It may also modulate inflammation and promote phagocytosis.

## **Alternate Names**

- TCDO
- Oxoferin
- Tetrachlorodecaoxide

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** TCDO exerts its antiseptic and wound-healing effects through bacterial killing and increased oxygenation at the wound site.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Primarily applied topically. Systemic absorption is minimal with topical use.  Information on metabolism and elimination pathways is limited.
- **Mode of action:** Although not fully elucidated, TCDO's mechanism of action involves killing bacteria and enhancing oxygen supply to the wound, which promotes healing.  It is thought to potentially affect macrophage activity and modulate inflammation.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation:** Not fully established.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily via topical route. Information on specific metabolic or excretory pathways is limited.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
