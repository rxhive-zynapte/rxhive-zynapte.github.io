## **Usage**

- Thiamine Nitrate, a form of vitamin B1, is prescribed for the treatment and prevention of thiamine deficiency, including beriberi (peripheral neuropathy and heart failure) and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (encephalopathy and psychosis). It's also used in patients with poor nutritional intake or malabsorption.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Vitamin, essential nutrient.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Thiamine is a crucial cofactor for several enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, including pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. These enzymes play vital roles in energy production, particularly within the nervous system and heart.

## **Alternate Names**

- Vitamin B1
- Thiamine hydrochloride (another salt form)
- Aneurine hydrochloride
- Antiberiberi factor

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Thiamine is essential for the synthesis of acetylcholine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), neurotransmitters vital for nerve function. Its role in carbohydrate metabolism impacts energy production in all cells, especially those in the brain and heart. Thiamine also influences the pentose phosphate pathway, supporting nucleotide synthesis and other cellular processes.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Thiamine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract in limited amounts. It is converted to its active form, thiamine pyrophosphate, in the liver. Thiamine is widely distributed throughout the body, though highest concentrations are found in skeletal muscle, heart, liver, kidneys, and brain. Excess thiamine is excreted through the kidneys.
- **Mode of Action:** Thiamine's active form, thiamine pyrophosphate, acts as a coenzyme for essential enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism.  It is crucial for decarboxylation reactions of pyruvate and alpha-ketoglutarate, vital steps in energy production through the Krebs cycle.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Deficiency Prevention:** 1-2 mg orally per day.
- **Mild Deficiency:** 50-100 mg orally daily.
- **Severe Deficiency:** Up to 300 mg orally daily in divided doses, or 10-20 mg intramuscularly (IM) three times a day for up to two weeks, followed by oral therapy.
- **Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome:** Initially, 100 mg intravenously (IV) slowly, then 50-100 mg daily IM or IV until the patient can maintain a regular diet.

#### **Children:**

- Dosage is generally based on the recommended daily allowance (RDA), adjusted as needed for deficiency.
- **RDA:** 0.2 mg/day (0-6 months), 0.3 mg/day (7-12 months), 0.5 mg/day (1-3 years), 0.6 mg/day (4-8 years), 0.9 mg/day (9-13 years), 1.2 mg/day (males 14-18 years), 1 mg/day (females 14-18 years).
- Pediatric dosing should be carefully determined by a physician and may be adjusted based on the severity of deficiency.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are generally required but monitoring for deficiency is important due to potential dietary inadequacies and decreased absorption.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary in cases of severe renal impairment, as thiamine is excreted renally. Monitor serum levels.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific adjustments are typically required, but monitor liver function.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Dosage should be individualized based on specific comorbid conditions and overall health.

### **Clinical Use Cases:**

- **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:** Patients in these settings may require increased thiamine supplementation due to stress, altered metabolism, and potential for inadequate nutrition.  Dosing should be individualized based on the clinical situation and the patient's nutritional status.
- **Emergency Situations (e.g., Wernicke's encephalopathy, suspected thiamine deficiency):** High doses of IV thiamine are typically administered, followed by IM or IV until the patient is stable and can tolerate oral intake.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- Dose adjustments are based on patient response and clinical status. Monitoring thiamine levels can be helpful, especially in severe cases. Consider renal function for patients with renal impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Rare and generally mild at therapeutic doses.  May include sweating, restlessness, itching, tightness in the throat, warmth, or mild rash.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, though rare, can occur. Symptoms can include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, hives, and itching. Immediate medical attention is required.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- No significant long-term adverse effects are associated with thiamine use at recommended dosages.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Anaphylaxis is a rare but serious ADR that requires immediate treatment.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to thiamine or any component of the formulation.


## **Drug Interactions**

- **Fluorouracil:** Thiamine may interfere with the activity of fluorouracil.
- **Loop Diuretics (e.g., furosemide):** May increase thiamine excretion.
- **Digoxin:** May enhance digoxin-induced arrhythmias in thiamine deficient states.
- **Neuromuscular Blocking Agents:** Concurrent administration of thiamine and neuromuscular blocking agents may result in enhanced neuromuscular blockade.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** A (injectable) and C (oral at doses above RDA).
- Thiamine is essential during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The RDA is 1.4 mg/day. Higher doses should only be used if clinically indicated and under medical supervision.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Coenzyme for carbohydrate metabolism, crucial for energy production and nerve function.
- **Side Effects:** Generally rare and mild at therapeutic doses.  Serious allergic reactions are possible.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:** Fluorouracil, loop diuretics, digoxin, neuromuscular blocking agents.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Essential nutrient, RDA is 1.4 mg/day. Higher doses require careful consideration.
- **Dosage:** Varies depending on indication and severity.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for resolution of deficiency symptoms (e.g., neurological improvement, improved cardiac function). Thiamine levels can be monitored, especially in severe cases.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Thiamine is often included in multivitamin formulations and B-complex vitamins.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess for any history of hypersensitivity reactions.
- **Specific Populations:** Pregnant and breastfeeding women should follow RDA unless otherwise directed by a physician.  Geriatric patients should be monitored for deficiency.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Alcoholism can significantly deplete thiamine levels and increase the risk of severe deficiency.
