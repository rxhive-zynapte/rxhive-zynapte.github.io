## **Usage**

- Thiamine (vitamin B1) is essential for carbohydrate metabolism and nerve function. It's used to treat and prevent thiamine deficiency, including beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS). It's also prescribed for patients with alcohol use disorder, those undergoing refeeding after malnutrition, and those with certain genetic disorders affecting thiamine metabolism.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Vitamin, essential nutrient.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Thiamine is a cofactor for several enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, including pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.  These enzymes are crucial for energy production, particularly in the brain and nervous system.

## **Alternate Names**

- Vitamin B1, aneurine hydrochloride

- **Brand Names:**  Numerous brands are available, including Betalin, Thiamilate


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Thiamine's primary role is as a coenzyme in the decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids.  It is essential for the synthesis of acetylcholine and the pentose sugars required for DNA and RNA production. Thiamine deficiency leads to impaired carbohydrate metabolism, resulting in energy deficits, especially in neural tissues.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Thiamine is absorbed in the small intestine, primarily by passive diffusion at low concentrations and active transport at higher concentrations. It is then converted to its active form, thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP).  TPP is widely distributed in the body, with higher concentrations in skeletal muscle, heart, liver, kidneys, and brain. Thiamine is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily by the kidneys.

- **Mode of Action:** Thiamine, in its active form (TPP), acts as a cofactor for critical enzymes in the Krebs cycle and pentose phosphate pathway, including pyruvate dehydrogenase and transketolase.

- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** No direct receptor binding or enzyme inhibition actions are involved. Thiamine's effect is primarily mediated through its coenzyme activity.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion, with minor hepatic metabolism.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Deficiency Prevention:** 1.2 mg/day for males, 1.1 mg/day for females.
- **Mild Deficiency:** 5-30 mg/day orally for several weeks.
- **Severe Deficiency (Beriberi/WKS):**  Initial: 50-100 mg IV, followed by 10-20 mg IM or IV tid for 2 weeks. Maintenance: 5-10 mg/day orally for 1 month.

#### **Children:**

- **Deficiency Prevention:** 0.2-1.2 mg/day depending on age.
- **Deficiency Treatment:** 10-50 mg/day orally or IM/IV, divided into doses, based on severity.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Standard adult dose, monitor for adverse reactions.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be necessary, especially in severe impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Monitor closely for side effects.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider the interaction of thiamine with other medications.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation:** Administer 100 mg IV before glucose administration.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Prophylactic dose for malnourished patients.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Supplementation may be necessary for patients with risk of deficiency.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Consider supplementation in at-risk patients.
- **Emergency Situations (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest):** 100 mg IV prior to glucose.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- Dose adjustments are necessary for patients with renal impairment, hepatic dysfunction, and for those on interacting medications.  Therapeutic drug monitoring may be used.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Generally well-tolerated. Rarely, some individuals might experience sweating, nausea, restlessness, or tightness in the throat.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Anaphylaxis requires immediate medical intervention.

## **Contraindications**

- Known hypersensitivity to thiamine.

## **Drug Interactions**

-  May interact with certain neuromuscular blocking agents (e.g., vecuronium), potentially enhancing their effects.  Loop diuretics can increase thiamine excretion.  Certain antibiotics may decrease thiamine absorption.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
