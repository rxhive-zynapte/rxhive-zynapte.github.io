## **Usage**

Thiocolchicoside is prescribed as an adjuvant treatment for painful muscle contractures in acute spinal pathology in adults and adolescents from 16 years onwards. It is classified as a muscle relaxant. Its mechanism of action involves acting centrally on the spinal cord and brain, where it helps relieve muscle stiffness and improve muscle movement.

## **Alternate Names**

While Thiocolchicoside is the generic name, it's marketed under various brand names globally, such as Muscoril and Tiocolis.  Regional variations of the name may also exist.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Thiocolchicoside's muscle relaxant properties come from its action on the central nervous system. It mimics the action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine, neurotransmitters that inhibit neuronal activity.  By acting as a competitive GABAA receptor antagonist and inhibiting glycine receptors, thiocolchicoside enhances inhibitory neurotransmission, reducing muscle tone and spasms. It also possesses some anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Thiocolchicoside is well-absorbed orally. It is metabolized in the liver to 3-demethylthiocolchicine (SL59.0955 or M2).  This metabolite is of concern due to its aneugenic potential (causing abnormalities in chromosome number), raising concerns about potential harm to developing cells.  The elimination pathways have not been fully elucidated but likely involves a combination of hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Oral: 8 mg every 12 hours (maximum 16 mg/day) for up to 7 consecutive days.
Intramuscular (IM): 4 mg every 12 hours (maximum 8 mg/day) for up to 5 consecutive days.

#### **Children:**

Thiocolchicoside is contraindicated in children under 16 years old due to safety concerns, especially the aneugenic potential of its metabolite.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  While no specific dosage adjustment is universally recommended, caution is advised due to potential age-related decline in hepatic and renal function. Careful monitoring is essential.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary, but specific guidelines are not readily available. Consultation with a nephrologist is advised.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment may be necessary due to the liver's role in metabolizing the drug. Consultation with a hepatologist is recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Thiocolchicoside should be used cautiously in patients with epilepsy or seizure risk due to its potential convulsant activity. Pre-existing kidney or liver diseases require close monitoring and potential dose adjustments. 

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources primarily address thiocolchicoside's use in acute musculoskeletal pain related to spinal conditions. No specific dosing recommendations are given for clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its application in these settings would be off-label and require careful risk-benefit assessment by the physician.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage modifications may be required in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. No specific recommendations on adjusting for metabolic disorders or genetic polymorphisms are provided. The presence of diarrhea also warrants dosage reduction or discontinuation.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Drowsiness
* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Abdominal pain or discomfort
* Gas or flatulence


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)
* Liver injury (indicated by abdominal pain, dark urine, jaundice)
* Blood cell disorders
* Severe cutaneous reactions
* Rhabdomyolysis
* Seizures (especially in predisposed individuals)
* Reproductive disorders
* Pancreatitis
* Vasovagal reactions
* Fainting


### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic use beyond the recommended duration should be avoided due to the aneugenic potential of its metabolite, which raises concerns about cancer risk, impaired fertility, and potential teratogenic effects.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Any serious side effects, including allergic reactions, liver injury, seizures, or blood disorders, require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to thiocolchicoside or any of the excipients
* Pregnancy (due to teratogenic risk)
* Breastfeeding (as it passes into breast milk)
* Women of childbearing potential not using reliable contraception
* Children under 16 years old


## **Drug Interactions**

Thiocolchicoside can interact with:

* **CNS Depressants:**  Co-administration with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or opioids can increase drowsiness and impair motor function.
* **NSAIDs and Corticosteroids:** Concurrent use may increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects and bleeding.
* **Anticoagulants/Antiplatelets:** May enhance the effects of these medications, increasing bleeding risk.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Thiocolchicoside is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to the potential risk of fetal harm and neonatal exposure.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Centrally acting muscle relaxant enhancing GABAergic and glycinergic neurotransmission.
* **Side Effects:** Drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, allergic reactions, liver injury, seizures (rare).
* **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, breastfeeding, hypersensitivity, age <16 years.
* **Drug Interactions:** CNS depressants, NSAIDs, anticoagulants.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
* **Dosage:**  Adults: Oral 8mg every 12h (max 16mg/day) for up to 7 days, IM 4mg every 12h (max 8mg/day) for up to 5 days.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests, renal function tests, complete blood count if prolonged use is unavoidable.


## **Popular Combinations**

Thiocolchicoside is often combined with NSAIDs (e.g., etoricoxib, aceclofenac) or analgesics (e.g., paracetamol) for enhanced pain relief in musculoskeletal conditions.  However, such combinations should be used cautiously and monitored for increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse effects.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Screen for allergies, renal/hepatic dysfunction, history of seizures, and concomitant medications.
* **Specific Populations:** Contraindicated in pregnancy, breastfeeding, and children <16 years. Elderly patients require careful monitoring.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Avoid alcohol while taking thiocolchicoside. Caution with driving and operating machinery due to potential drowsiness.
