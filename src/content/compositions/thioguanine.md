  - q: >-
      What is the recommended dosage for Thioguanine?**


      **A:**  The initial dose for adults and children is usually 2 mg/kg/day
      orally. The dose can be cautiously increased to 3 mg/kg/day after 4 weeks
      if there is no response or toxicity. Dosages should be adjusted for renal
      or hepatic impairment, age, and TPMT/NUDT15 enzyme activity.

      How does TPMT or NUDT15 enzyme activity affect Thioguanine dosing?**


      **A:** Patients with low or absent TPMT or NUDT15 activity are at
      significantly higher risk of severe myelosuppression and require
      substantial dose reductions. Testing for these deficiencies before
      starting thioguanine is highly recommended.

      How does Thioguanine interact with allopurinol?**


      **A:**  While allopurinol inhibits the metabolism of mercaptopurine, it
      does not have the same effect on thioguanine.  However, the combination
      may still increase the risk of myelosuppression. Hence caution and
      monitoring are advised when using these drugs concomitantly.

## **Usage**

- Thioguanine is primarily used to treat acute leukemias, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It is also used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).  It is an antineoplastic antimetabolite, specifically a purine analog.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antineoplastic antimetabolite.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Thioguanine integrates into DNA and RNA, disrupting nucleic acid synthesis and inhibiting cell proliferation. It also undergoes methylation, forming metabolites that inhibit purine synthesis.

## **Alternate Names**

- 6-TG
- 2-Amino-6-mercaptopurine
- 6-Thioguanine
- **Brand Name:** Tabloid, Lanvis

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Thioguanine is an antineoplastic antimetabolite that disrupts DNA and RNA synthesis, thereby suppressing cell proliferation. Its cytotoxic effects primarily target rapidly dividing cells, such as those in the bone marrow, leading to myelosuppression.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  Thioguanine is administered orally and its absorption is variable and incomplete. It is metabolized in the liver by methylation and xanthine oxidase, with inactive metabolites excreted primarily in the urine. The drug can also be deactivated by guanine deaminase.
- **Mode of Action:** Thioguanine incorporates into DNA and RNA, disrupting nucleic acid function and cell replication. Its metabolites inhibit purine synthesis, further hindering cell growth. Thioguanine's cytotoxic action is cell cycle-specific, mainly affecting the S phase.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Thioguanine doesn't directly bind to receptors or modulate neurotransmitters. Its primary action involves inhibiting enzymes essential for nucleotide synthesis, thereby interfering with DNA replication.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Thioguanine's metabolites are eliminated mostly through renal excretion, with a minor portion eliminated in the feces.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: 2 mg/kg/day orally. If no response or toxicity is observed after 4 weeks, this dose can be cautiously increased up to 3mg/kg/day. 
- The daily dose is usually calculated to the nearest multiple of 20mg.
- The total daily dose may be given at one time.

#### **Children:**

- Initial dose:  2 mg/kg/day orally. If no response or toxicity is observed after 4 weeks, this dose can be cautiously increased up to 3mg/kg/day. 
- Pediatric patients are more sensitive to thioguanine's effects; monitor closely for liver toxicity.
- Adjust doses based on body surface area and clinical response.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Consider reducing the initial dosage due to potential age-related decline in hepatic, renal, or cardiac function. 
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage reduction may be necessary for patients with impaired renal function.  
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Reduce the dosage for patients with liver impairment to minimize the risk of hepatotoxicity.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Patients with comorbid conditions like diabetes or cardiovascular diseases should be monitored closely.


### **Clinical Use Cases**
Thioguanine's clinical use is primarily focused on the treatment of leukemias.  Its use in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations is not indicated.



### **Dosage Adjustments:**
- Dose modifications are necessary for hepatic or renal dysfunction.  
- For patients with known TPMT or NUDT15 enzyme deficiencies, thioguanine dosage requires careful adjustment due to increased myelosuppression risks.  
- Patients homozygous for TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency typically require 10% or less of the standard dose.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Loss of appetite
- Sores in the mouth and throat
