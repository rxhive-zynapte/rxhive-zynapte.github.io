## **Usage**

Thiomersal is primarily used as a preservative in some multi-dose vials of vaccines to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination.  It is not used for treating any medical condition on its own. Its pharmacological classification is antiseptic and antifungal.  Thiomersal's mechanism of action involves inhibiting bacterial and fungal growth by binding to sulfhydryl groups in microbial proteins, disrupting their function.

## **Alternate Names**

Thiomersal is also known as thimerosal (primarily in the US). Brand names vary depending on the specific product it is used in.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Thiomersal exerts its antimicrobial effect by disrupting the function of essential microbial proteins, leading to their inactivation or death.

**Pharmacokinetics:** When administered via injection (as a component of a vaccine), thiomersal is metabolized to ethylmercury and thiosalicylate. Ethylmercury is further broken down into inorganic mercury.  Ethylmercury is cleared from the body more quickly than methylmercury (found in some fish) and is less likely to accumulate. Elimination occurs primarily through the kidneys.

**Mode of Action:** Thiomersal binds to sulfhydryl groups (-SH) in proteins, particularly those involved in essential microbial functions. This binding disrupts the protein's structure and activity, ultimately leading to the microbe's inactivation.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  The primary mode of action is through direct binding to sulfhydryl groups rather than specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation.


## **Dosage**

Thiomersal is not prescribed or dosed independently. It is present in trace amounts as a preservative in certain multi-dose vaccines.  

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
Mild reactions at the injection site, such as redness and swelling, are the most common side effects.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Allergic reactions, though rare, can occur.

### **Long-Term Effects**
No long-term adverse effects associated with thiomersal in vaccines have been established.



## **Contraindications**

Known hypersensitivity to thiomersal is a contraindication.

## **Drug Interactions**

Limited specific drug interactions have been reported with thiomersal. However, concomitant administration of thiomersal-containing eye drops with oral tetracyclines may cause ocular irritation.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
Available evidence suggests that the small amount of thiomersal in vaccines does not pose a risk to pregnant women or breastfeeding infants.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Antiseptic/antifungal; binds to sulfhydryl groups in microbial proteins, disrupting function.
- **Side Effects:** Primarily local injection site reactions (redness, swelling). Rarely allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to thiomersal.
- **Drug Interactions:** Potential for ocular irritation with concomitant tetracycline eye drops.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Generally considered safe.
- **Dosage:**  Present as a preservative in some multi-dose vaccines; not independently dosed.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Not typically required as used in vaccines.


## **Popular Combinations**

Thiomersal is not used in drug combinations in a therapeutic sense. It is present as a preservative in some multi-dose vaccines that may contain multiple antigens.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Screen for hypersensitivity.
- **Specific Populations:** No specific precautions beyond hypersensitivity for pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, children, or the elderly.
