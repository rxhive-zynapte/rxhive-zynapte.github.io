## **Usage**

- Thymol is prescribed for various conditions, including oral hygiene as a mouthwash or gargle to treat sore throat and minor mouth inflammation, and topically for acne and hemorrhoids. It also acts as a cough suppressant and is used as a dietary supplement.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Thymol is classified as an antiseptic, antifungal, and antibacterial agent.  It also exhibits antispasmodic and antioxidant properties.
- **Mechanism of action:** Thymol exerts its antiseptic effect by disrupting microbial cell membranes, leading to leakage of cellular contents and ultimately cell death. Its antifungal and antibacterial properties stem from its ability to inhibit microbial growth and proliferation. The antispasmodic action of thymol is attributed to its ability to relax smooth muscles.

## **Alternate Names**

- Thymol is also known as isopropyl meta-cresol.
- Brand names containing thymol may vary depending on the region and formulation. Examples include Thymovar, Saugella Attiva, and various thyme-based syrups and gargles.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Thymol primarily affects the cell membranes of microorganisms, disrupting their integrity and causing leakage of intracellular components. This leads to microbial cell death, which is responsible for its antiseptic action.  Thymol can also modulate inflammatory responses by reducing levels of inflammatory markers such as TNF-α. For cough suppression, it may act on receptors in the respiratory tract.  Its antioxidant action is due to its free radical scavenging abilities. 
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Thymol can be administered orally, topically, or by inhalation.  Oral absorption can be rapid but depends on the formulation, with degradation happening in the stomach or intestines. Thymol is metabolized in the liver, primarily through conjugation reactions, and metabolites are then eliminated primarily in the urine. Some elimination also occurs through the feces and breast milk.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  As a gargle, dilute 1 part thymol solution with 3 parts warm water and gargle 3-4 times daily.  As a cough syrup in adults, 15 ml three times daily. For other uses, dosages vary depending on the formulation and indication.  Traditional preparations suggest up to 4 g of thyme herb (containing 0.03% thymol) daily for adults.
#### **Children:**  For children above 4 years, 5 ml of thyme syrup three times a day as a dietary supplement for cough. For children aged 4-12, traditional preparations suggest single doses of 0.5–0.9 ml of a liquid extract or tincture 3-5 times daily. The use of thyme extract in children younger than 4 years of age should be restricted and under medical supervision. Thyme gargle is not suitable for infants and young children.
#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are generally required for elderly patients, but caution is advised.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended, but exercise caution.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustments are available, but use with caution.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with diabetes, gastrointestinal inflammation, and urinary tract inflammation.

### **Clinical Use Cases:** Dosage for clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, or ICU settings are not established for thymol as a single agent.  It may be present as a component in some antiseptic solutions used in these settings, but dosages are not specifically tied to thymol content.

### **Dosage Adjustments:** Dosage adjustments beyond the standard recommendations should be made based on the individual patient's condition, tolerance, and response to therapy.  Close monitoring is recommended, especially in patients with pre-existing conditions.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
- Skin irritation (topical use)
- Gastric irritation if swallowed
- Allergic reactions (skin rash, respiratory symptoms)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:** 
- Anaphylaxis (rare)
- Breathing difficulties (rare)
- Swelling of face, lips, tongue (rare)

### **Long-Term Effects:**  Long-term effects of thymol use are not well established, however, chronic skin irritation may occur with prolonged topical use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Severe allergic reactions like anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, angioedema require immediate medical intervention.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to thymol or any component of the formulation
- Infants and young children (for gargles)
- Pregnancy (high oral doses)
- Breastfeeding (high oral doses)
- Children under 12 (for oral use of essential oil)

## **Drug Interactions**

- **Anticoagulants:**  Thymol may potentiate the effects of anticoagulant medications like warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicoumarol, fluindione, phenindione, and phenprocoumon.
- **Antibiotics:**  Synergistic effects have been observed with some antibiotics, especially against Gram-negative bacteria. 
- **Antifungals:** Thymol shows synergistic activity with fluconazole against *Candida albicans* and *Candida tropicalis* in both planktonic and biofilm modes.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Thymol is contraindicated in high oral doses during pregnancy and breastfeeding. While considered likely safe in food amounts, it's unknown if larger medicinal amounts are safe.  The FDA has not established a pregnancy category for thymol. Thymol can be excreted into breast milk, potentially posing risks to the newborn.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Disrupts microbial cell membranes, leading to cell death. Also exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antispasmodic properties.
- **Side Effects:** Skin irritation, gastric irritation, allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, pregnancy (high doses), breastfeeding (high doses), infants, and young children (gargles), and children under 12 (oral use of essential oil)
- **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, certain antibiotics, antifungal drugs
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in high doses
- **Dosage:**  Varies depending on the indication and formulation.  Gargle: Dilute 1 part with 3 parts water, 3-4 times/day.  Cough syrup (adults): 15ml TID. Traditional:  up to 4g thyme herb (0.03% thymol) daily for adults.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for signs of allergic reaction, skin irritation, and any unusual symptoms.  When combined with anticoagulants, monitor coagulation parameters.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Thymol is often combined with other antiseptic agents in mouthwashes and gargles. It is also found in combination with anise oil in some cough syrups.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Pre-screening for allergies is crucial.  Caution should be exercised in patients with bleeding disorders, diabetes, gastrointestinal inflammation, and urinary tract inflammation.
- **Specific Populations:** See above under standard dosage.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Avoid concurrent use with alcohol, as it may exacerbate gastric irritation. Smoking may decrease the efficacy of thymol.
