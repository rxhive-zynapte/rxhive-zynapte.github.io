## **Usage**

- Thymosin alpha 1 (thymalfasin) is primarily prescribed as an adjunct therapy for chronic hepatitis B and C in patients with compensated liver disease.  It is also used in the treatment of various cancers (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, malignant melanoma) and as an immune booster for conditions like HIV/AIDS, cystic fibrosis, and DiGeorge's syndrome, and as an adjunct to boost response to vaccines.  It may also be used to block steroid-induced apoptosis of thymocytes and support geriatric immune function, as well as for other conditions requiring immunomodulation.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Immunomodulatory agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Thymosin alpha 1 acts by modulating and enhancing the immune system's response. It promotes T-cell maturation and differentiation, enhances cytokine production (e.g., interferon-gamma), and increases natural killer (NK) cell activity.

## **Alternate Names**

- Thymalfasin
- **Brand Names:** Zadaxin, Immunocin Alpha Plus, Imualfa

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Thymosin alpha 1 primarily affects the immune system.  It enhances cell-mediated immunity by promoting the maturation and differentiation of T lymphocytes.  It stimulates the production of cytokines like interferon-gamma, interleukin-2, and interleukin-12, which further amplify the immune response. Increased NK cell cytotoxic activity is also observed.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Administered subcutaneously, thymosin alpha 1 is absorbed rapidly, reaching peak serum levels within 1-2 hours. It has a short half-life of approximately 2 hours. It is metabolized and excreted primarily via renal pathways, with 31-60% of the dose excreted in urine.
- **Mode of Action:** Thymosin alpha 1 binds to specific receptors on the surface of lymphocytes, triggering intracellular signaling cascades that lead to enhanced T-cell function and cytokine production. The precise receptor and detailed downstream signaling pathways are still under investigation.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion with some hepatic metabolism.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 1.6 mg subcutaneously twice weekly for 6-12 months for chronic hepatitis B. Alternative dosing regimens include 1.5 mg subcutaneously every third day.  Dosages may range from 0.8-6.4 mg for single doses, and 1.6-16 mg daily for 5-7 days for multiple doses.
- For patients <40 kg:  40 mcg/kg twice weekly.

#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy have not been established in patients below the age of 18 years.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution; no specific dosage adjustment recommendations.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; dosage adjustments may be needed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution in decompensated liver disease; monitor liver function tests.  May continue therapy unless signs of liver failure occur.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in autoimmune disorders; potential for exacerbation.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations:** No specific dosing guidelines provided in source material.  Dosage must be determined by healthcare provider.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- Adjust dosage based on patient weight, renal and hepatic function, and response to therapy.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Local injection site reactions (redness, discomfort, pain)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Erythema, transient muscle atrophy, polyarthralgia, hand edema, rash, allergic reactions (itching, rash, difficulty breathing), increased ALT levels

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Unknown

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), significant liver dysfunction

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to thymosin alpha 1
- Immunosuppressed patients (e.g., organ transplant recipients) unless benefits outweigh risks
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding (use caution)

## **Drug Interactions**

-  Limited data available; caution advised with other immunomodulating agents.  Do not mix in same syringe with other medications.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (animal studies have not demonstrated adverse effects, but no adequate human studies).  Avoid unless clearly needed.
- **Breastfeeding:** Unknown if excreted in breast milk; use caution.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Enhances T-cell function, cytokine production, and NK cell activity.
- **Side Effects:** Primarily injection site reactions; rare systemic effects.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, immunosuppression, pregnancy (caution).
- **Drug Interactions:** Limited information, potential interactions with immunosuppressants.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution.
- **Dosage:** 1.6 mg SC twice weekly (chronic hepatitis B).  Variations exist; see above.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests, HBeAg, HBsAg, HBV DNA, ALT.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Interferon alpha for chronic hepatitis B and C

## **Precautions**

- Monitor for hypersensitivity reactions, liver function abnormalities, and signs of infection.  Pregnant/breastfeeding women should consult a doctor.  Children: Safety and efficacy not established. Exercise caution in patients with autoimmune diseases.
