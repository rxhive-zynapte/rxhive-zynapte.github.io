## **Usage**

Tibolone is a synthetic steroid medication prescribed for the relief of menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women, typically starting at least one year after the last natural menstrual bleed.  It is also used in the prevention of osteoporosis (weakening of the bones) in postmenopausal women at high risk of fractures who cannot tolerate or are contraindicated for other osteoporosis medications.  It has estrogenic, androgenic, and progestogenic properties, meaning it acts like a combination of these hormones in the body.  Pharmacologically, it is classified as a Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) or more specifically as a "tissue selective estrogen complex" (TSEC). It's not a true HRT but has some similar effects. Tibolone isn't technically classified under a single pharmacological category like antibiotic or analgesic. It is a unique medication that modulates estrogen, progesterone, and androgen receptors in a tissue-specific manner.

## **Alternate Names**

Tibolone is often marketed under the brand name Livial. There are no widely recognized international variations for "Tibolone."

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Tibolone itself is inactive. However, it is quickly metabolized into three compounds: 3α-hydroxytibolone, 3β-hydroxytibolone, and Δ4-isomer. These metabolites have distinct effects on different tissues. 3α-hydroxytibolone and Δ4-isomer have estrogenic effects on bone and the brain, reducing the risk of osteoporosis and alleviating menopausal symptoms like hot flushes and vaginal dryness.  The 3β-hydroxytibolone metabolite exerts androgenic effects. Δ4-isomer has progestogenic effects on the endometrium (uterine lining), reducing the risk of endometrial hyperplasia (thickening) that can occur with estrogen-only HRT.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Tibolone is well-absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within one to two hours. It is extensively metabolized in the liver via CYP3A4, with the metabolites displaying varying elimination half-lives. Primarily excreted in the urine (mainly as sulfates and glucuronides) with a small amount in feces.

**Mechanism of Action:** Tibolone's metabolites exert tissue-specific effects by binding to estrogen, androgen, and progesterone receptors in different organs.  This selective modulation of receptor activity leads to its unique clinical profile.

**Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly renal excretion with minor hepatic contribution.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The standard dose is 2.5 mg (one tablet) taken orally once daily, preferably at the same time each day. Treatment is typically initiated one year after the last natural menstrual period.  In cases of surgical menopause (removal of ovaries), treatment can begin immediately.

#### **Children:**

Tibolone is not indicated for use in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is generally necessary in elderly patients, but data on those over 65 is limited.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Caution is advised. Monitor closely for fluid retention, as estrogens can exacerbate this.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in patients with acute liver disease or a history of liver disease where liver function tests have not returned to normal.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Tibolone should be used with caution in women with conditions including uncontrolled hypertension, active or past venous thromboembolism, diabetes with vascular complications, gallbladder disease, migraine, and certain types of cancer (endometrial, ovarian, breast cancer history).


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Tibolone is *not* indicated for:

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures** (consider discontinuing 4-6 weeks before elective surgery)
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations** (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest)


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments based on renal/hepatic impairment are not routinely made but require careful clinical monitoring, with particular caution in patients with renal dysfunction, as fluid retention can occur.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Vaginal bleeding or spotting
- Abdominal pain
- Breast pain or tenderness
- Weight gain
- Acne
- Headache
- Dizziness


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Venous thromboembolism (blood clots), including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism
- Stroke
- Myocardial infarction (heart attack)
- Breast cancer
- Liver dysfunction (jaundice)



### **Long-Term Effects**

- Increased risk of breast cancer, stroke and venous thromboembolism with long-term use.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue)
- Hypersensitivity reactions (rash, itching, hives)


## **Contraindications**

- Known, past, or suspected breast cancer
-  Estrogen-dependent neoplasia
- Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding
-  Untreated endometrial hyperplasia
- Venous thromboembolism (history)
- Arterial thromboembolic disease (history)
- Liver disease
- Pregnancy
- Breastfeeding


## **Drug Interactions**

Tibolone is metabolized by CYP3A4.  Concomitant use with CYP3A4 inducers like rifampicin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John's wort may decrease tibolone's effectiveness. Conversely, inhibitors of CYP3A4 might increase tibolone levels.  Tibolone can also potentiate the effects of anticoagulants like warfarin.  Interactions with other medications metabolized by CYP3A4 are possible.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Tibolone is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Tissue-selective estrogenic, androgenic, and progestogenic effects through active metabolites.
- **Side Effects:** Vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, breast pain, weight gain, acne, headache, dizziness. Serious effects include VTE, stroke, myocardial infarction, and breast cancer.
- **Contraindications:** Breast cancer, estrogen-dependent tumors, undiagnosed vaginal bleeding, VTE history, pregnancy, breastfeeding, liver disease.
- **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors, warfarin.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
- **Dosage:** 2.5 mg orally once daily.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for vaginal bleeding, breast changes, signs of thromboembolism, and liver function tests.

## **Popular Combinations**

Tibolone is typically used as monotherapy.  Combining it with other HRTs is not recommended.  Supplementation with calcium and vitamin D may be advised for osteoporosis prevention.

## **Precautions**

- Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.
- Evaluate individual risk-benefit, especially in women over 60.
- Regularly re-assess for continued need for therapy.
- Pre-screening for relevant contraindications and risk factors is crucial.
- Monitor closely in patients with specific conditions like renal/hepatic impairment, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.
