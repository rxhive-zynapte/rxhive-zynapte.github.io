## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Ticagrelor is prescribed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of MI. It also reduces the rate of stent thrombosis in patients stented for ACS treatment.  It's also indicated to reduce the risk of a first MI or stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for such events, especially those with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with acute ischemic stroke (NIH stroke scale score â‰¤5) or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA).
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Antiplatelet agent, P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor antagonist.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Ticagrelor prevents platelet activation and aggregation by reversibly binding to the P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor, an adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor on platelets. This inhibition prevents ADP-induced platelet aggregation, reducing the risk of thrombus formation.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:** None specifically listed.
- **Brand Names:** Brilinta, Brilique, Ticagrelor Sandoz.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Ticagrelor reversibly inhibits P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptors on platelets, reducing platelet activation and aggregation.  This leads to a decreased incidence of thrombotic events.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Rapidly absorbed after oral administration.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by CYP3A4/5 enzymes in the liver to an active metabolite.
    - **Elimination:**  Primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion. Renal elimination plays a minor role.
- **Mode of Action:** Ticagrelor directly and reversibly binds to the P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor, preventing ADP-mediated platelet activation and aggregation.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:**  Reversible antagonist of the P2Y<sub>12</sub>  receptor.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4/5, biliary excretion, and minor renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **ACS or History of MI:** Loading dose: 180 mg orally once. Maintenance dose: 90 mg orally twice daily for 1 year. Maintenance dose after 1 year: 60 mg orally twice daily.
- **CAD (no prior MI or stroke):** 60 mg orally twice daily.
- **Acute Ischemic Stroke or TIA:** Loading dose: 180 mg orally once. Maintenance dose: 90 mg orally twice daily for up to 30 days.

#### **Children:** Not established; use is not recommended in individuals under 18 years old.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is required, but monitor closely due to increased bleeding risk.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Mild impairment: No dose adjustment. Moderate impairment: Consider risks and benefits, use with caution. Severe impairment: Contraindicated.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider potential drug interactions and bleeding risk, especially in patients with bleeding disorders, recent surgery, or concomitant use of anticoagulants or NSAIDs.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage is not provided in source for:
- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations** (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest)

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Consider renal/hepatic dysfunction, concomitant medications, and bleeding risk.  


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Bleeding (e.g., nosebleeds, bruising, prolonged bleeding from cuts), shortness of breath (dyspnea), dizziness, headache, nausea, gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea, indigestion, constipation), rash.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe bleeding (including intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding), ventricular pauses and bradycardia (slow heart rate), allergic reactions (angioedema).

### **Long-Term Effects:** Not well defined, but potential for increased bleeding risk with extended use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Severe bleeding, allergic reactions (angioedema), bradycardia.



## **Contraindications**

- Active pathological bleeding (e.g., peptic ulcer, intracranial hemorrhage)
- History of intracranial hemorrhage
- Hypersensitivity to ticagrelor
- Severe hepatic impairment
- Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, clarithromycin, itraconazole).

## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP450 Interactions:**  CYP3A4 substrate and inhibitor.
- **Drug Interactions:**
    - Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (increased ticagrelor levels and risk of bleeding)
    - Aspirin (recommended at low maintenance dose, high doses decrease ticagrelor effectiveness)
    - Anticoagulants (increased bleeding risk)
    - NSAIDs (increased bleeding risk)
    - Digoxin (monitor digoxin levels)
    - Statins (some interactions may occur).
- **Other Interactions:** Alcohol (moderate consumption generally acceptable, excessive alcohol may increase bleeding risk), smoking (may decrease ticagrelor effectiveness), grapefruit juice.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Not established, not recommended during pregnancy due to potential for fetal harm.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Not recommended, as ticagrelor and its metabolites are excreted in animal milk; potential risk to infants unknown.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Reversible P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor antagonist, inhibits platelet aggregation.
- **Side Effects:** Bleeding, shortness of breath, dizziness, headache, nausea.
- **Contraindications:**  Active bleeding, ICH history, hypersensitivity, severe hepatic impairment, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.
- **Drug Interactions:** Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, aspirin, anticoagulants, NSAIDs.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Not recommended.
- **Dosage:** See dosage section above.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Aspirin (low dose)


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Evaluate for bleeding risk factors, hepatic impairment, and drug interactions before starting therapy. Monitor for bleeding and other adverse events.
- **Specific Populations:** See special cases in dosage section.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:**  Moderate alcohol consumption, avoid smoking.  Driving restrictions not typically necessary unless dizziness or other side effects occur.
