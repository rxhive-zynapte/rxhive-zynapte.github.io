## **Usage**

Tinzaparin is an anticoagulant medication primarily used to prevent and treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). It's also utilized for preventing clotting in intravenous lines during hemodialysis and extracorporeal circulation in patients without high bleeding risk.  It is classified as a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).

Tinzaparin works by enhancing the activity of antithrombin III, which inhibits clotting factors Xa and thrombin (IIa).  This action prevents the formation and extension of blood clots.

## **Alternate Names**

The generic name is tinzaparin sodium.  A common brand name is Innohep.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Tinzaparin primarily inhibits factor Xa, with a lesser effect on thrombin (factor IIa). It binds to antithrombin III, accelerating its inhibition of factor Xa.  This prevents the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, reducing fibrin formation and clot development.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Tinzaparin is administered subcutaneously and has a bioavailability of approximately 90%. Peak plasma activity is reached in 4-6 hours. It is primarily eliminated through renal excretion as the unchanged drug, with a half-life of roughly 80 minutes.  It does not cross the placenta in significant amounts.

**Mode of Action:** Tinzaparin binds to antithrombin III, a natural anticoagulant.  This binding enhances antithrombin's ability to neutralize factor Xa, a key enzyme in the coagulation cascade. The inhibition of factor Xa interrupts the clotting process, preventing thrombus formation and extension.  Tinzaparin's effect on factor Xa is more pronounced than its effect on thrombin.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

For DVT/PE treatment: 175 anti-Xa IU/kg subcutaneously once daily for at least six days and until adequately anticoagulated with warfarin (INR of 2.0 for two consecutive days). Warfarin therapy should be initiated within 1-3 days of starting tinzaparin.

For DVT prophylaxis (general surgery, moderate risk): 3500 anti-Xa IU subcutaneously 2 hours before surgery, then once daily postoperatively for 7-10 days.

For DVT prophylaxis (general surgery, high risk): 4500 anti-Xa IU subcutaneously 12 hours before surgery, then once daily postoperatively.

For DVT prophylaxis (non-surgical, moderate/high risk due to acute illness): 3500/4500 anti-Xa IU subcutaneously once daily while the risk persists.

For hemodialysis: 2000-2500 anti-Xa IU bolus at the start of dialysis (sessions â‰¤4 hours) or 2500 anti-Xa IU bolus plus 750 IU/hour continuous infusion (sessions >4 hours).

#### **Children:** Use and dose must be determined by a doctor, as safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric populations.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Standard dosing but monitor closely, especially in those with renal impairment or low body weight (<45kg).
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution if creatinine clearance is <30 mL/min; dosage adjustments may be needed based on creatinine clearance and anti-Xa monitoring.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dosage adjustment is typically needed, as the liver is not the primary route of elimination.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Exercise caution in patients with conditions that increase bleeding risk (e.g., peptic ulcer disease, uncontrolled hypertension). For patients with a prosthetic heart valve, tinzaparin is not recommended during pregnancy.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

DVT/PE treatment is generally handled as described above. Doses for surgical and non-surgical prophylaxis should follow guidelines established by the doctor. Dosages for ICU use, emergency situations, intubation, and mechanical ventilation, or other specific clinical settings may require adjustment based on individual patient factors and should be determined on a case-by-case basis by the treating physician.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Adjustments may be necessary in patients with renal impairment, extremes of body weight, or other factors affecting drug clearance.  Consult clinical guidelines and/or a hematologist for optimal dosing in these situations.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Bleeding or bruising at the injection site
* Headache
* Nosebleed
* Fever


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Major bleeding (gastrointestinal, intracranial, etc.)
* Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)
* Allergic reactions


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Long-term use may increase the risk of osteoporosis.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

HIT, severe bleeding, and allergic reactions require immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

* Active major bleeding
* History of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)
* Hypersensitivity to tinzaparin, heparin, sulfites, or benzyl alcohol (in vial formulations)



## **Drug Interactions**

Tinzaparin interacts with many medications that affect blood clotting, including:

* Oral anticoagulants (warfarin)
* Antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, clopidogrel)
* NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen)

Monitor patients closely for bleeding complications. It is also important to note that tinzaparin should not be mixed with other injections.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Tinzaparin is a Pregnancy Category B drug.  While animal studies haven't shown teratogenic effects, its use during pregnancy requires careful consideration of risks and benefits. It's recommended in pregnancy only when the benefits outweigh the risks. It does not appear to cross the placenta in significant amounts.

Tinzaparin is present in breast milk in very low levels and is not orally bioavailable. It is generally considered compatible with breastfeeding, though caution is advised.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Enhances antithrombin III activity, inhibiting factor Xa and, to a lesser extent, thrombin.
* **Side Effects:** Bleeding/bruising, injection site reactions, headache, nosebleed, fever.  Rarely: HIT, major bleeding, allergic reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Active bleeding, HIT history, hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Anticoagulants, antiplatelet drugs, NSAIDs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category B; use with caution in pregnancy if benefits outweigh risks. Generally compatible with breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** 175 IU/kg SC daily for DVT/PE; other doses for prophylaxis.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  INR (if used with warfarin), signs of bleeding, platelet counts, renal function.


## **Popular Combinations**

Tinzaparin is often used in conjunction with warfarin for the treatment of DVT/PE. Tinzaparin provides immediate anticoagulation, while warfarin takes several days to reach therapeutic levels.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess bleeding risk, renal function, and drug allergies before starting tinzaparin.
* **Specific Populations:**  Monitor elderly and renally impaired patients closely. Use caution during pregnancy.  Not established for pediatric use.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Advise patients to avoid activities that increase bleeding risk.
