## **Usage**

Tioconazole is an antifungal medication primarily used to treat vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), commonly known as a vaginal yeast infection.  It belongs to the imidazole class of antifungals. Tioconazole works by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol, a crucial component of the fungal cell membrane. This disruption leads to increased cell permeability and ultimately the death of the fungus.

## **Alternate Names**

Tioconazole is the generic name.  A popular brand name is Vagistat-1.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Tioconazole exerts its antifungal effect by inhibiting the enzyme 14-α demethylase, a cytochrome P450 enzyme essential for ergosterol biosynthesis in fungi. Ergosterol is a vital component of the fungal cell membrane, and its depletion results in altered membrane permeability, leading to fungal cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  When administered intravaginally, tioconazole is minimally absorbed systemically.  It persists in vaginal fluids for 24 to 72 hours, providing sustained antifungal activity.  The small amount absorbed systemically is metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine and feces.

**Mode of Action:**  Tioconazole binds to 14-α demethylase, inhibiting its activity. This blocks the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol, disrupting the fungal cell membrane integrity and causing cell death.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism with subsequent excretion in urine and feces. A small amount may be excreted unchanged in the feces.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**  A single dose of one applicator full (approximately 4.6 g of 6.5% ointment containing 300 mg of tioconazole) is inserted intravaginally, preferably at bedtime.

#### **Children:**  For children 12 years and older, the dosage is the same as for adults. Tioconazole is not recommended for children under 12 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients**: No dosage adjustment is typically necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: No specific dosage adjustments are recommended.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**: No specific dosage adjustments are recommended, though caution is advised.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**: Patients with diabetes or HIV should consult a healthcare professional before self-treating with tioconazole.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Tioconazole is specifically indicated for vulvovaginal candidiasis and is not used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are not usually necessary for renal or hepatic impairment.




## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Vaginal burning
- Vaginal itching
- Vaginal irritation
- Headache


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, swelling, difficulty breathing)


### **Long-Term Effects**

No specific long-term effects have been reported with the single-dose intravaginal application of tioconazole.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Serious allergic reactions requiring urgent medical intervention are rare.





## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to tioconazole or other imidazoles.



## **Drug Interactions**

No clinically significant drug interactions have been reported with intravaginal tioconazole.  However, it can weaken latex or rubber products like condoms and diaphragms, so their use within 72 hours of application is not recommended.  Some sources suggest that tioconazole may interact with certain medications metabolized by the CYP450 enzyme system, but the clinical significance of these interactions with intravaginal use is minimal.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category C. Tioconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.  It is unknown if tioconazole is excreted in breast milk.  Consult a physician before use during breastfeeding.  Some manufacturers recommend discontinuing breastfeeding temporarily while using tioconazole.





## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits fungal ergosterol synthesis, disrupting cell membrane integrity.
- **Side Effects:**  Vaginal burning, itching, irritation, headache. Rarely, allergic reactions.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to tioconazole or imidazoles.
- **Drug Interactions:** Minimal with intravaginal use; weakens latex/rubber products.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Category C; use with caution if benefits outweigh risks; consult a physician before breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** One applicator full (300mg) intravaginally as a single dose.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Resolution of symptoms.



## **Popular Combinations**

Tioconazole is typically used as a single-agent therapy.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Patients should be screened for hypersensitivity.
- **Specific Populations:** Pregnant or breastfeeding women should consult a doctor.  Not recommended for children under 12.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid sexual intercourse during treatment and for 72 hours afterward due to potential damage to latex/rubber contraceptives.
