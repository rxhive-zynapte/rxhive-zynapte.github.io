## **Usage**

- Tirofiban is prescribed for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).  It is used in conjunction with heparin and aspirin to decrease the rate of thrombotic cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, or refractory ischemia/repeat cardiac procedure). It can be administered to patients managed medically or those undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or atherectomy.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antiplatelet agent; Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Tirofiban reversibly inhibits the binding of fibrinogen to platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptors, preventing platelet aggregation.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Tirofiban
- **Brand Name:** Aggrastat

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Tirofiban produces rapid and sustained inhibition of platelet aggregation by blocking the final common pathway of platelet aggregation. This reduces the formation of platelet-rich thrombi in coronary arteries.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Administered intravenously, therefore 100% bioavailability.
    - **Metabolism:** Limited hepatic metabolism.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion (approximately 65% as unchanged drug), with about 25% eliminated in feces.
    - **Half-life:** Approximately 2 hours.
    - **Clearance:** 213-314 mL/min (healthy subjects), 152-267 mL/min (patients with coronary artery disease).
- **Mode of Action:** Tirofiban selectively and competitively binds to the GP IIb/IIIa receptor on the platelet surface, blocking the binding of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and other adhesive ligands. This inhibition prevents platelet cross-linking and aggregation.
- **Receptor Binding:** GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion as unchanged drug.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **NSTE-ACS (Early Invasive Strategy <4 hours or Primary PCI):**  25 mcg/kg intravenous bolus over 3 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.15 mcg/kg/min for 12-24 hours (up to 48 hours).
- **NSTE-ACS (Early Invasive Strategy â‰¥4 hours to 48 hours) :** 0.4 mcg/kg/min IV infusion for 30 minutes, then 0.1 mcg/kg/min continuous infusion for at least 48 hours (up to 108 hours maximum). Total treatment duration not to exceed 108 hours.

#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy not established in children under 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is necessary unless there is renal impairment.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min):** Reduce the maintenance dose by 50%. For the bolus regimen, administer 25 mcg/kg over 3 minutes and then infuse at 0.075 mcg/kg/min. For the loading dose regimen, the initial infusion rate is 0.2 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes followed by 0.05 mcg/kg/min maintenance infusion.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No dosage adjustment is recommended for mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Data for severe impairment are unavailable.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use caution in patients with recent bleeding, coagulopathy, platelet disorders, or history of thrombocytopenia.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- The dosage recommendations outlined above cover the clinical use cases, including ACS management with or without planned PCI and primary PCI for acute myocardial infarction. Dosages are optimized based on timing of angiography and whether the patient is managed with an early invasive strategy or not.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- See "Special Cases" above for renal impairment dosing adjustments.
