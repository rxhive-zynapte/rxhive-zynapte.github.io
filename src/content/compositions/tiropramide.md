## **Usage**

- Tiropramide hydrochloride is prescribed for the relief of abdominal pain and discomfort associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is also used to treat biliary and renal colic and spastic conditions of the urogenital tract.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Antispasmodic agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Tiropramide increases intracellular cAMP levels in smooth muscle cells and promotes calcium ion binding to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, leading to muscle relaxation.

## **Alternate Names**

- Tiropramide hydrochloride
- CR 605
- Alfospas
- Maiorad
- Piromide
- Propa
- Spastro
- Tipron
- Tiram
- Tiramide
- FLOSPAN


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Tiropramide relaxes the smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal, biliary, renal, and urogenital tracts, reducing spasms and pain. It achieves this without significantly affecting the autonomic nervous system.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - *Absorption:*  Readily absorbed after oral administration.
    - *Metabolism:*  Information not found in provided sources.
    - *Elimination:* Information not found in provided sources.
- **Mode of Action:** Increases intracellular cAMP and promotes calcium binding to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, leading to smooth muscle relaxation.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation**: Primarily affects intracellular cAMP levels and calcium ion handling within smooth muscle cells.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Information not found in provided sources.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 100 mg two to three times a day. Some patients may require 200 mg twice daily.

#### **Children:**

- Safety and effectiveness have not been established in children under 12 years old.  Dosing adjustments based on age and symptoms might be necessary for adolescents.  Some sources indicate usage in children older than 6 with dosage based on weight (8 mg/kg/day).

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and titrate upwards based on individual tolerance and organ function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Careful dose adjustment is necessary. Monitor renal function regularly.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution and adjust the dose. Close monitoring of liver function is recommended.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualized dosing adjustments may be necessary for patients with conditions like glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, or those receiving antihypertensive medications.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

While tiropramide might be used as an adjunct medication to manage spasms and pain in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, and emergencies, specific dosage recommendations are not explicitly defined in the provided sources. Dosage should be adjusted based on the individual patient's needs and clinical condition.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Individualized dosing adjustments are recommended based on factors like renal/hepatic dysfunction, other comorbid conditions, and patient response to therapy.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

## **Drug Interactions**

- Other antispasmodic or anticholinergic agents may amplify muscle-relaxant effects, potentially leading to hypotension or excessive muscle relaxation.
- Drugs that inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin, rifampicin) can affect the metabolism of tiropramide.
- Alcohol should be avoided as interactions are unknown.
