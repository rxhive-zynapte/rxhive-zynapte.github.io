## **Usage**

Tizanidine is primarily prescribed for the management of spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury. It is classified as a central alpha-2 adrenergic agonist and acts as a muscle relaxant. Its mechanism of action involves mimicking the action of norepinephrine in the central nervous system, leading to inhibition of motor neurons and reduced muscle tone.

## **Alternate Names**

Tizanidine is the generic name. A popular brand name under which it is marketed is Zanaflex.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Tizanidine primarily affects the central nervous system by binding to alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, similar to clonidine but with significantly less impact on blood pressure. This binding inhibits the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, leading to decreased motor neuron activity and reduced muscle tone.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:** Tizanidine is well-absorbed orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1-2 hours.
* **Metabolism:** It is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP1A2 enzymes.
* **Elimination:** Tizanidine is mainly eliminated via hepatic metabolism, with a small portion excreted unchanged in the urine. The elimination half-life is approximately 2-3 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Tizanidine's action is primarily central, affecting the spinal cord and brain. It binds to presynaptic alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, inhibiting the release of excitatory neurotransmitters.  This, in turn, reduces the excitation of motor neurons, leading to muscle relaxation.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Tizanidine primarily binds to alpha-2 adrenergic receptors.  It does not significantly inhibit enzymes or directly modulate other neurotransmitters besides reducing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters like glutamate and aspartate.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism via CYP1A2, followed by renal excretion of metabolites.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The initial dose is typically 2 mg every 6-8 hours as needed, not to exceed three doses (maximum 16 mg) in 24 hours.  The dose can be gradually increased by 2-4 mg every 1-4 days until optimal therapeutic effect is achieved, with a maximum total daily dose of 36 mg divided into three doses.

#### **Children:**

Tizanidine is not recommended for pediatric use. Safety and efficacy have not been established in children under 18 years old.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose and titrate cautiously due to potential for increased sensitivity and decreased clearance.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution.  If creatinine clearance is less than 25 mL/min, reduce the dose.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution. Close monitoring for adverse reactions is necessary. Avoid in severe hepatic impairment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor closely in patients with cardiovascular disease due to the potential for hypotension and bradycardia.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Tizanidine's use is primarily limited to the management of spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury. It is not indicated for use in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are based on patient response, tolerance, and renal or hepatic function.  Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may require lower doses.  Dosage adjustments might be necessary for patients concurrently taking CYP1A2 inhibitors.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Drowsiness, dry mouth, dizziness, fatigue, weakness, hypotension, and hallucinations.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Liver damage (hepatotoxicity), severe hypotension, bradycardia.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Limited data are available on long-term effects, but chronic use may lead to dependence and withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Hepatotoxicity, allergic reactions, and severe hypotension are clinically significant ADRs requiring immediate intervention.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to tizanidine, concomitant use of CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin), severe hepatic impairment.


## **Drug Interactions**

CYP1A2 inhibitors (fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) can significantly increase tizanidine levels, increasing the risk of toxicity. Concomitant use is contraindicated.  Alcohol, sedatives, and other CNS depressants can potentiate tizanidine's sedative effects. Use with caution with antihypertensives due to additive hypotensive effects.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category:  Limited data available. Use only if clearly needed and potential benefits outweigh risks. Tizanidine is excreted in breast milk; use with caution in breastfeeding mothers.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Central alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, reduces muscle tone.
* **Side Effects:** Drowsiness, dry mouth, dizziness, fatigue, hypotension.  Rarely: hepatotoxicity.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, concurrent CYP1A2 inhibitors, severe hepatic impairment.
* **Drug Interactions:** CYP1A2 inhibitors, CNS depressants, antihypertensives.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
* **Dosage:** Initial 2 mg q6-8h prn; max 36 mg/day in divided doses.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests, blood pressure, heart rate.

## **Popular Combinations**

Tizanidine is sometimes used in combination with other muscle relaxants or analgesics for enhanced relief of spasticity and pain, but potential additive side effects should be considered.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Monitor liver function and blood pressure regularly.  Assess for allergies and history of hepatic or renal impairment.
* **Specific Populations:**  Use with caution in elderly, pregnant/breastfeeding women, and those with hepatic/renal impairment.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants.  Caution with activities requiring alertness (e.g., driving).
