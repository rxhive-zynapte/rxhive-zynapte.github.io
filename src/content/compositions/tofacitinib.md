## **Usage**

Tofacitinib is prescribed for the treatment of:

*   **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA):**  Moderate to severe active RA in adult patients who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate (MTX) or other non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).  It can be used as monotherapy or in combination with MTX.
*   **Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA):** Active PsA in adult patients who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to a prior DMARD. It can be used with or without MTX.
*   **Ulcerative Colitis (UC):** Moderately to severely active UC in adults who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers or other therapies.
*   **Polyarticular Course Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (pcJIA):**  In children 2 years of age and older who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to MTX. It can be used as monotherapy or in combination with MTX.
*   **Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS):**  Active AS in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to NSAIDs.



**Pharmacological Classification:** Tofacitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor.

**Mechanism of Action:**  Tofacitinib primarily inhibits JAK1 and JAK3, intracellular enzymes that mediate signaling pathways involved in immune and inflammatory responses. By inhibiting these enzymes, tofacitinib modulates the signaling of various cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.

## **Alternate Names**

**International Nonproprietary Name (INN):** Tofacitinib citrate

**Brand Names:** Xeljanz, Xeljanz XR

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Tofacitinib selectively inhibits JAK1 and JAK3, reducing the activity of signaling pathways involved in inflammation and immune responses. This leads to decreased production of inflammatory cytokines and a reduction in joint inflammation and other symptoms of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:**  Orally administered tofacitinib is rapidly absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentrations within approximately 0.5 to 1 hour (immediate-release) and 2 hours (extended-release).
*   **Metabolism:**  Primarily metabolized by the liver, mostly by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19.
*   **Elimination:**  Primarily eliminated via the kidneys (approximately 70%) with the remainder excreted in feces. The half-life is approximately 3 hours for the immediate-release formulation and 7 hours for the extended-release formulation.

**Mode of Action:** Tofacitinib binds to the catalytic site of JAK enzymes, preventing their activation and subsequent phosphorylation of STAT proteins. This disruption of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway reduces the expression of genes involved in inflammation and immune responses.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Tofacitinib selectively inhibits JAK1 and JAK3 enzymes.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion (approximately 70%), with the remaining amount excreted in feces.  Hepatic metabolism by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 plays a role.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   **Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis:**
    *   **Immediate-release tablets:** 5 mg twice daily.
    *   **Extended-release tablets:** 11 mg once daily.
*   **Ulcerative Colitis:**
    *   **Induction:** 10 mg twice daily (immediate-release) or 22 mg once daily (extended-release) for 8 weeks. May extend to 16 weeks if needed.
    *   **Maintenance:** 5 mg twice daily (immediate-release) or 11 mg once daily (extended-release).  For patients with loss of response, 10 mg twice daily (immediate-release) or 22 mg once daily (extended-release) may be considered for the shortest duration possible.

#### **Children (pcJIA, ages 2 to 17 years):**

*   **Oral Solution or Immediate-Release Tablets:** Weight-based dosing twice daily. Please consult a pediatric dosing guide or the full prescribing information for specific weight-based recommendations.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is generally required, but monitor for adverse events.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    *   **Moderate to severe:**  5 mg once daily when the usual dose is 5 mg twice daily (immediate-release) or 11 mg once daily (extended-release).  Administer after dialysis on dialysis days.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
    *   **Moderate:** 5 mg once daily when the usual dose is 5 mg twice daily (immediate-release) or 11 mg once daily (extended-release). For UC, 5 mg twice daily when the usual dose is 10 mg twice daily (immediate release), or 11 mg once daily (extended-release) when the usual dose is 22 mg once daily (extended-release).
    *   **Severe:** Tofacitinib is contraindicated.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider comorbidities and potential drug interactions when determining the appropriate dose.  Use with caution in patients at risk for cardiovascular events, malignancy, or venous thromboembolism (VTE).

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Tofacitinib is not indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest. Its use is limited to the treatment of specific immune-mediated inflammatory diseases mentioned in the "Usage" section.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on renal/hepatic function as described above.  Monitor for laboratory abnormalities, including lymphopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. Dosage interruption or discontinuation may be necessary based on the severity of these abnormalities.  Consult the full prescribing information for specific guidelines on laboratory monitoring and dosage adjustments.
