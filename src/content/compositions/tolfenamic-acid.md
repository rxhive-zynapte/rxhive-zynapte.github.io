## **Usage**

- Tolfenamic acid is prescribed for the treatment of migraine headaches and mild to moderate pain, including primary dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation).  It may also be used off-label for vascular headaches.  Veterinary uses include the treatment of pain and inflammation in various animals.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID)
- **Mechanism of Action:** Tolfenamic acid primarily inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes. These enzymes are responsible for the production of prostaglandins, which mediate inflammation and pain.  The drug also exhibits direct antagonistic action on prostaglandin receptors and inhibits leukotriene B4 chemotaxis of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, further contributing to its anti-inflammatory effects.

## **Alternate Names**

-  N-(2-methyl-3-chlorophenyl) anthranilic acid
- **Brand Names:**  Clotan, Tolfem, Tufnil, Migrex (and various veterinary formulations)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Tolfenamic acid exerts analgesic (pain-relieving), anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic (fever-reducing) effects by inhibiting prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis. It binds strongly to plasma proteins (approximately 99%).
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Tolfenamic acid is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  Peak plasma concentrations are reached in approximately 60-90 minutes.  Absorption is delayed when taken orally, with a mean lag time of about 32 minutes.  Food or milk can increase the rate of absorption.  Antacids containing aluminum hydroxide can decrease absorption, while those with magnesium hydroxide can increase it. The bioavailability is around 75-85%.
    - **Distribution:** The volume of distribution is 1.79-3.2 L/kg.  High concentrations are found in plasma, digestive tract, liver, lungs, and kidneys.  The drug exhibits a linear pharmacokinetic profile.
    - **Metabolism:** Tolfenamic acid is metabolized in the liver and undergoes enterohepatic circulation.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated via renal excretion (about 90%) and feces. The plasma half-life is approximately 2 hours, but the mean life in ruminants can range from 8 to 15 hours.

- **Mode of Action:**  Tolfenamic acid inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis.  It also acts as a direct antagonist on prostaglandin receptors and inhibits leukotriene B4 chemotaxis.

- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**  COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme inhibition, prostaglandin receptor antagonism.

- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion and some fecal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Migraine:** 200 mg at the onset of symptoms; may repeat once after 1-2 hours if needed.
- **Mild to Moderate Pain:** 100-200 mg three times daily.

#### **Children:**

- A pediatric dosage regimen has not yet been established.  Not recommended for use in patients under 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration due to increased risk of adverse effects, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation. Monitor closely.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be necessary. Avoid use in severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution due to potential for increased adverse effects.  Close monitoring of liver function tests is necessary. Dose adjustments may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with extreme caution in patients with asthma, bronchospasm, bleeding disorders, cardiovascular diseases, peptic ulceration, hypertension, liver or heart problems, systemic lupus erythematosus, or inflammatory bowel disease.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

The primary clinical use cases for humans are migraine and mild to moderate pain. The dosage guidelines mentioned above apply.
