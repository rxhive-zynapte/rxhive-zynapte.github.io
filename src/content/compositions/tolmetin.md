## **Usage**

Tolmetin is prescribed for the relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, including acute flares and long-term management of chronic disease, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in patients 2 years and older. It belongs to the pharmacological classification of Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs).  Tolmetin's mechanism of action involves inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis by blocking cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzymes.  Prostaglandins contribute to inflammation, pain, and fever.

## **Alternate Names**

Tolmetin is also known as Tolmetin sodium. Brand names include Tolectin, Tolectin DS.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Tolmetin exerts its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects through the inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, thereby reducing prostaglandin synthesis.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Tolmetin is well-absorbed orally. Peak plasma levels are reached in about 1 to 2 hours. Taking it with food can delay absorption but does not significantly affect bioavailability.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver via oxidation to inactive metabolites.
* **Elimination:**  Tolmetin is almost entirely eliminated through the kidneys, primarily as inactive metabolites. Elimination half-life ranges from 1 to 2 hours for the initial rapid phase and about 5 hours for the slower phase.

**Mode of Action:** Tolmetin acts by binding to and inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. This inhibition prevents the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin precursors, resulting in reduced prostaglandin synthesis.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Tolmetin inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes.

**Elimination Pathways:** Tolmetin is primarily excreted in the urine as inactive metabolites.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis:** Initial dose: 400 mg orally three times a day. The maintenance dose ranges from 600 mg to 1800 mg orally per day, divided into three doses.

#### **Children (2 years and older):**

* **Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis:** Initial dose: 20 mg/kg/day orally, divided into three or four doses. The maintenance dose ranges from 15 mg/kg/day to 30 mg/kg/day orally, divided into three or four doses.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution. May require dosage adjustments due to increased sensitivity and potential age-related kidney problems.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Not recommended in patients with advanced renal disease. Dosage adjustment might be necessary for patients with mild to moderate impairment.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution to avoid adverse effects. Discontinue if liver function worsens.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, history of gastrointestinal bleeding/ulcers, asthma, or bleeding disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Tolmetin's primary clinical use is for managing chronic conditions like osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, including acute flares. There are no specific dosage recommendations for procedures like intubation, surgical operations, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  It is not typically used in these settings.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be needed in elderly patients, those with renal or hepatic impairment, and those with certain comorbid conditions as outlined above. Dosage adjustment should be based on the patient's response to therapy and aimed at achieving the lowest effective dose.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
Nausea, indigestion, stomach upset, abdominal pain, diarrhea, gas (flatulence), vomiting, constipation, headache, weakness, dizziness, drowsiness.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcers, perforation, heart attack, stroke,  anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, renal dysfunction, liver injury, fluid retention (edema),  high blood pressure.

### **Long-Term Effects:**
Chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular complications.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**
Anaphylaxis, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), severe gastrointestinal bleeding,  acute liver failure, renal failure, myocardial infarction, stroke.

## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to tolmetin, aspirin, or other NSAIDs
* History of aspirin-sensitive asthma
* Perioperative pain in CABG surgery
* Late-stage pregnancy

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin):** Increased bleeding risk.
* **Antihypertensives (e.g., ACE inhibitors):** Reduced antihypertensive effect.
* **Diuretics:** Reduced diuretic effect and increased risk of renal impairment.
* **Lithium:** Increased lithium levels.
* **Methotrexate:** Increased methotrexate toxicity.
* **Corticosteroids:** Increased risk of gastrointestinal ulceration.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Avoid, especially during the third trimester due to the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in the fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:** Tolmetin passes into breast milk. Breastfeeding while using tolmetin is not recommended.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, gastrointestinal upset, headache, dizziness,  GI bleeding, ulcers, cardiovascular events, renal dysfunction.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, aspirin-sensitive asthma, CABG surgery, late pregnancy.
* **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, antihypertensives, diuretics, lithium, methotrexate.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid in pregnancy, not recommended while breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** Adults: 400 mg TID initially, up to 1800 mg/day. Children (2+ years): 20 mg/kg/day initially, up to 30 mg/kg/day.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Renal function, liver function, blood pressure, complete blood count, signs of GI bleeding.

## **Popular Combinations**

While some clinicians may utilize combination therapies for certain patients, there are no widely recognized "popular combinations" for tolmetin with other medications.  Combination use should always consider potential drug interactions and adverse effects.


## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Assess for allergies, renal/hepatic impairment, cardiovascular disease, and history of GI ulcers.
* **Pregnant Women:** Avoid, especially in the third trimester.
* **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Not recommended.
* **Children & Elderly:** Adjust dosage as needed and monitor closely.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Limit alcohol and avoid smoking. Caution while driving or operating machinery due to potential drowsiness.
