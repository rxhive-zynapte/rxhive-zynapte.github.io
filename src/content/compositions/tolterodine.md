## Usage

Tolterodine is prescribed for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency.  It is pharmacologically classified as an antimuscarinic agent. Tolterodine acts by blocking the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, specifically the M3 subtype, in the bladder. This inhibits involuntary bladder contractions and reduces the urge to urinate.

## Alternate Names

While "tolterodine" is the generic name, it is marketed under various brand names such as Detrol and Detrol LA.  Detrusitol is another brand name used internationally.  There are no significant regional variations in the name.

## How It Works

**Pharmacodynamics:** Tolterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist, exhibiting selectivity for M3 receptors over M1, M2, and M4 receptors. This selectivity leads to a more targeted effect on the bladder with fewer systemic anticholinergic side effects. By blocking M3 receptors in the detrusor muscle of the bladder, tolterodine reduces involuntary detrusor contractions, increases bladder capacity, and decreases the sensation of urgency.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Tolterodine is well-absorbed after oral administration, with absolute bioavailability of around 65% for the immediate-release formulation and 77% for the extended-release formulation. Food does not significantly affect absorption.
* **Metabolism:**  Tolterodine is extensively metabolized in the liver primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6 to its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine.  Individuals with genetic polymorphisms leading to poor CYP2D6 metabolism may have higher plasma concentrations of tolterodine and require dosage adjustments.
* **Elimination:** Tolterodine and its metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine. The elimination half-life of tolterodine is approximately 2 to 3 hours, while the half-life of the active metabolite is 3 to 4 hours. For the extended-release formulation, the elimination half-life is longer at 5 to 6 hours.

**Mode of Action:** Tolterodine exerts its therapeutic effect by competitively binding to M3 muscarinic receptors on the detrusor muscle, preventing acetylcholine from binding and triggering smooth muscle contraction. This effectively reduces the frequency and intensity of involuntary bladder contractions.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Tolterodine is a competitive antagonist of muscarinic M3 receptors. There is no significant inhibition of other enzymes or modulation of neurotransmitters.

**Elimination Pathways:** Tolterodine is eliminated primarily through hepatic metabolism by CYP2D6 followed by renal excretion of both the parent drug and its metabolites.


## Dosage


### Standard Dosage

#### Adults:

* **Immediate-release:** 2 mg orally twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart. The dose may be reduced to 1 mg twice daily based on individual response and tolerability.
* **Extended-release:** 4 mg orally once daily.  The dose may be reduced to 2 mg once daily based on individual response and tolerability.

#### Children:

Tolterodine is generally not recommended for use in children for OAB. Its efficacy and safety have not been established in this population. For children with other conditions such as nocturnal enuresis, use and dosage must be determined by a specialist and is generally not recommended.

#### Special Cases:

* **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dose adjustments are recommended for elderly patients based solely on age. However, consider age-related decreases in hepatic and renal function which may necessitate dose reduction.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**
    * **CrCl 10-30 mL/min:** Not to exceed 1 mg twice daily (immediate-release) or 2 mg once daily (extended-release).
    * **CrCl <10 mL/min:** Not recommended.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
    * **Mild to moderate (Child-Pugh class A or B):** Not to exceed 1 mg twice daily (immediate-release) or 2 mg once daily (extended-release).
    * **Severe (Child-Pugh class C):** Not recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor carefully patients with pre-existing cardiac conditions, especially those at risk for QT prolongation. Adjust dosage in patients taking CYP3A4 inhibitors or CYP2D6 inhibitors.

### Clinical Use Cases

Tolterodine's use is specifically indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder symptoms.  It is not typically used in the context of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.

### Dosage Adjustments

Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on patient-specific factors like renal or hepatic dysfunction, concomitant medications, and individual response to therapy. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors necessitates a reduction in tolterodine dosage to a maximum of 1 mg twice daily for the immediate-release form or 2 mg once daily for the extended-release form.



## Side Effects

### Common Side Effects

* Dry mouth
* Headache
* Dizziness
* Constipation
* Blurred vision
* Dry eyes
* Abdominal pain
* Dyspepsia
* Somnolence

### Rare but Serious Side Effects

* Angioedema
* Anaphylaxis
* Urinary retention

### Long-Term Effects

Long-term effects of tolterodine are not extensively studied, but chronic complications are uncommon.  Monitor for potential anticholinergic effects with prolonged use.


### Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)

Clinically significant ADRs include angioedema, anaphylaxis, and QT prolongation. These require immediate medical intervention.


## Contraindications

* Urinary retention
* Gastric retention
* Uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma
* Hypersensitivity to tolterodine or any of its components

## Drug Interactions

Tolterodine interacts with several medications, including:

* **CYP3A4 Inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir):**  Reduce tolterodine dosage when co-administered.
* **CYP2D6 Inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine):**  Reduce tolterodine dosage or avoid co-administration.
* **QT Prolonging Drugs (e.g., mefloquine):**  Avoid co-administration due to increased risk of QT prolongation.
* **Antimuscarinic Drugs:**  Additive anticholinergic effects may occur when combined with other antimuscarinic agents.

## Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

* **Pregnancy:**  Tolterodine is classified as Pregnancy Category C.  Use only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the fetus.
* **Breastfeeding:** It is unknown whether tolterodine is excreted in breast milk.  A decision should be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

## Drug Profile Summary
