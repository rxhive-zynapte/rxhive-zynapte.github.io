## Usage

Tolvaptan is prescribed for:
- **Euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia:**  Specifically, it's used in adults with clinically significant hyponatremia (serum sodium <125 mEq/L or less marked hyponatremia that is symptomatic and resistant to fluid restriction), including patients with heart failure, cirrhosis, and SIADH.
- **Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD):** Indicated to slow kidney function decline in adults at risk of rapidly progressing ADPKD.

**Pharmacological Classification:** Tolvaptan is classified as a **vasopressin receptor 2 (V2) antagonist**.

**Mechanism of Action:** Tolvaptan selectively blocks the binding of arginine vasopressin (AVP) to V2 receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron. This action promotes the excretion of free water without affecting electrolyte excretion (aquaresis), thereby increasing serum sodium concentrations.

## Alternate Names

While "tolvaptan" is the generic name, it's marketed under brand names like **Samsca** (for hyponatremia) and **Jynarque** (for ADPKD).


## How It Works

**Pharmacodynamics:** Tolvaptan induces aquaresis by selectively antagonizing V2 receptors in renal collecting ducts. This results in increased excretion of electrolyte-free water, thereby concentrating serum sodium.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Tolvaptan is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentration in approximately 2 hours. Food does not significantly affect its bioavailability.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver via CYP3A4 enzymes.
* **Elimination:** Excreted mainly in the urine (40%) and feces (50%), with a half-life of about 9 hours.


**Mode of Action:** Tolvaptan competitively binds to V2 receptors in the renal collecting ducts, preventing the antidiuretic action of vasopressin. This inhibition leads to increased water excretion. 

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4, with subsequent renal and fecal excretion.

## Dosage


### Standard Dosage

#### Adults:

* **Hyponatremia:** Initial dose: 15 mg orally once daily.  Titrate to 30 mg after at least 24 hours, up to a maximum of 60 mg once daily, as needed to normalize serum sodium.  The treatment should not exceed 30 days due to the risk of liver injury. Therapy must be initiated and re-initiated in a hospital setting.
* **ADPKD:** Initial dose: 60 mg/day as a split dose (45 mg upon waking and 15 mg 8 hours later).  Titrate to 90 mg/day (60 mg + 30 mg) and then to 120 mg/day (90 mg + 30 mg) if tolerated, with at least one week between titrations. Patients may down-titrate based on tolerability.


#### Children:

Tolvaptan is not recommended for pediatric use due to a lack of safety and efficacy data.



#### Special Cases:

* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is generally required.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No adjustment needed for mild to moderate impairment (CrCl 10-79 mL/min). Not recommended for patients with CrCl <10 mL/min or on dialysis. Contraindicated in anuria.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No adjustment needed for mild to moderate impairment (Child-Pugh A and B). Use with caution in severe impairment (Child-Pugh C). Avoid use in patients with underlying liver disease.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring is required for patients with other conditions, especially those receiving medications that affect serum potassium levels or CYP3A4 activity.


### Clinical Use Cases

Tolvaptan's dosage is dictated by the indication (hyponatremia or ADPKD) rather than specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or ICU use. There is no specific dosage recommendation for emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.


### Dosage Adjustments

Dose adjustments are primarily based on renal and hepatic function, concomitant medications (CYP3A4 inhibitors), and patient tolerability as described above. Genetic polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism are not routinely considered for dose adjustment, but careful monitoring is advised.

## Side Effects

### Common Side Effects
Thirst, dry mouth, increased urination, polyuria, nocturia, asthenia.

### Rare but Serious Side Effects
Liver injury (hepatotoxicity), rapid increase in serum sodium (hypernatremia), anaphylaxis, angioedema.

### Long-Term Effects
Chronic liver disease with prolonged use, potential for dependence and electrolyte imbalance with chronic use.

### Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)
Hypernatremia, liver failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, acute kidney injury.

## Contraindications

Absolute contraindications include hypersensitivity to tolvaptan, anuria, volume depletion, hypovolemic hyponatremia, inability to sense or respond to thirst, concurrent use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, pregnancy, and breastfeeding. Relative contraindications include severe hepatic impairment and advanced ADPKD with severely reduced kidney function.


## Drug Interactions

Significant interactions occur with:

* **CYP3A4 Inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole):** Contraindicated with strong inhibitors and dose reduction is needed with moderate inhibitors.
* **CYP3A4 Inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin):** May reduce tolvaptan levels.
* **Diuretics:** Increased risk of dehydration and rapid sodium correction.
* **Digoxin:** Tolvaptan may increase digoxin levels.


## Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

**Pregnancy Safety Category:** X (contraindicated)

Tolvaptan is contraindicated in pregnancy due to the risk of fetal harm based on animal studies. Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception.

Tolvaptan is contraindicated during breastfeeding. It is unknown if tolvaptan is present in human milk; however, animal studies show that tolvaptan crosses into rat milk. There is a potential for serious adverse reactions, including hypernatremia and fluid depletion, in nursing infants. 


## Drug Profile Summary

* **Mechanism of Action:** V2 receptor antagonist, promotes aquaresis.
* **Side Effects:** Thirst, dry mouth, increased urination, liver injury, hypernatremia.
* **Contraindications:** Anuria, hypovolemic hyponatremia, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, pregnancy.
* **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers, diuretics, digoxin.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
* **Dosage:** See detailed dosage section above.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Serum sodium, liver function tests, urine output, fluid balance, vital signs.

## Popular Combinations

Generally, Tolvaptan is avoided in combination therapies, particularly when treating hyponatremia. Its usage alongside other medications needs careful monitoring and potential dose adjustments due to the risk of overly rapid sodium correction.

## Precautions

* **General Precautions:** Monitor serum sodium, liver function, and fluid balance closely.
* **Specific Populations:** See detailed dosage section above.
* **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid grapefruit juice; no specific restrictions on alcohol or smoking unless clinically indicated; driving may be impaired due to dizziness or weakness.
