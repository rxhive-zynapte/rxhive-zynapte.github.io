## **Usage**

Topiroxostat is prescribed for the treatment of hyperuricemia (high blood uric acid levels) in patients with gout. It belongs to the pharmacological class of xanthine oxidase inhibitors. Its mechanism of action involves selectively inhibiting xanthine oxidase, an enzyme crucial for uric acid production. By reducing uric acid levels, it aids in preventing gout flares and joint damage associated with urate crystal deposition.

## **Alternate Names**

Topiroxostat is also known as Topiloric, Uriadec or FYX-051.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Topiroxostat selectively and competitively inhibits xanthine oxidase, thereby reducing uric acid production. This leads to a decrease in serum and urine uric acid levels, preventing the formation of urate crystals in joints and other tissues.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:**  Topiroxostat exhibits good oral bioavailability.
* **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver. Main metabolites include N-oxide, N1-glucuronide and N2-glucuronide. It demonstrates strong inhibition of CYP2C8/9 and weak inhibition of CYP1A1/2, 3A4 and 2C19. It shows no inhibition of CYP2A6, 2B6, 2D6 and 2E1, and does not induce CYP enzymes. 
* **Elimination:** Excreted via both renal and hepatic routes, with a higher proportion through hepatic elimination. It inhibits renal transporters OAT1, OAT3, BCRP and OATP1B1.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Initial dose: 20 mg twice daily (BID), orally.
Maintenance dose: 60 mg BID, orally.
Maximum dose: 80 mg BID, orally.
Dosage titration: The dose can be gradually increased (e.g., by 20 mg increments every 2-4 weeks) based on serum uric acid levels and patient response, up to the maximum dose.

#### **Children:**

The safety and efficacy of Topiroxostat have not been established in pediatric patients.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Careful monitoring is recommended, though dosage adjustments are not typically required based on age alone.  Renal and hepatic function should be assessed.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments are necessary for patients with moderate to severe renal impairment. With creatinine clearance (CrCl) 30-50 mL/min, a maximum dose of 60 mg/day is recommended. With CrCl < 30 mL/min, the drug is contraindicated. Regular monitoring of renal function is advised.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, though specific dosage adjustments are not explicitly defined. Monitoring of liver function tests is recommended.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider individual patient factors and potential drug interactions when prescribing to patients with comorbid conditions.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of topiroxostat in specific medical settings such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations has not been established and is not recommended.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be necessary based on serum uric acid levels, renal function, hepatic function, concomitant medications, and individual patient response.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Elevated liver enzymes
* Gastrointestinal issues (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain)
* Headache
* Drowsiness
* Skin rash
* Fatigue



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
* Liver damage
* Severe hematological abnormalities (e.g., decreased white blood cell or platelet counts)

### **Long-Term Effects**

Limited data exists on long-term complications. However, long-term monitoring is recommended for potential renal or hepatic issues, as well as hematological abnormalities.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs include severe hypersensitivity reactions and liver dysfunction.




## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to Topiroxostat
* Severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min)
* Concomitant use of azathioprine or mercaptopurine


## **Drug Interactions**

* Theophylline
* Azathioprine
* Mercaptopurine
* Warfarin
* Other medications metabolized by CYP2C8/9, CYP1A1/2, CYP3A4 and CYP2C19



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Topiroxostat should generally be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Animal studies have shown some transfer of the drug to milk. Consult with a specialist regarding potential risks and alternative treatment options.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Selective xanthine oxidase inhibitor.
* **Side Effects:** Elevated liver enzymes, gastrointestinal issues, skin rash, fatigue, headache, drowsiness.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe renal impairment, concomitant azathioprine/mercaptopurine.
* **Drug Interactions:** Theophylline, azathioprine, mercaptopurine, warfarin, and drugs metabolized by certain CYP enzymes.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid unless benefits outweigh risks.
* **Dosage:** Initial 20 mg BID, titrate up to 80 mg BID.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Serum uric acid, liver function tests, renal function tests, complete blood count.


## **Popular Combinations**

NSAIDs or colchicine may be used for acute gout flares alongside chronic topiroxostat therapy for long-term management of hyperuricemia.


## **Precautions**

* Pre-existing liver or kidney disease: Careful monitoring is necessary.
* Hypersensitivity: Monitor for allergic reactions.
