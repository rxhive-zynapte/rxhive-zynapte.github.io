      improved oral bioavailability compared to Furosemide.  The equivalent
      doses are approximately 1 mg of Bumetanide = 20 mg of Torsemide = 40 mg of
      Furosemide.

## **Usage**

- Torasemide is prescribed for the treatment of edema associated with heart failure, kidney disease, and liver cirrhosis. It is also used to treat hypertension, though it's not typically a first-line agent.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Loop diuretic.
- **Mechanism of action:** Torasemide inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, leading to increased excretion of water and electrolytes, thus reducing fluid overload and blood pressure.

## **Alternate Names**

- International variations: Torasemid (German), torasémide (French).
- Brand names: Demadex®, Soaanz®.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Torasemide increases the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water by inhibiting the Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter in the loop of Henle.  It does not affect renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) under normal physiological conditions.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - **Absorption:** Oral bioavailability is approximately 80%. Food does not significantly affect absorption.
    - **Metabolism:**  Primarily metabolized in the liver via oxidation and hydroxylation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, predominantly CYP2C9.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted in urine and feces. The elimination half-life is about 3-4 hours in healthy individuals, but may be prolonged in patients with renal impairment.
- **Mode of action:** Torasemide acts by binding to the chloride-binding site of the Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter in the luminal membrane of the ascending loop of Henle, blocking its function.  This blocks the reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and water, leading to increased urine output.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion (approximately 80%), with a smaller fraction excreted in feces via biliary elimination.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Edema (Heart Failure, Renal Disease):** 10-20 mg orally once daily initially.  If inadequate response, double the dose until the desired effect is achieved, up to a maximum of 200 mg/day.
- **Edema (Hepatic Cirrhosis):** 5-10 mg orally once daily initially, usually administered with an aldosterone antagonist or potassium-sparing diuretic. If inadequate response, double the dose until the desired effect is achieved, up to a maximum of 40 mg/day.
- **Hypertension:** 5 mg orally once daily. If inadequate response after 4-6 weeks, increase to 10 mg once daily. If still inadequate, consider adding another antihypertensive agent.

#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy not fully established. Dosing should be determined on a case-by-case basis by a physician, usually starting with a lower dose based on body weight (0.13-0.25 mg/kg/day) and titrating up as needed based on clinical response.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate with lower doses and titrate carefully due to potential for reduced renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Higher doses may be required to achieve the desired effect. No specific dosage adjustments are provided in prescribing information, however, the maximum effective dose in moderate chronic kidney disease (eGFR >30 mL/min/1.73 m2) is 20-50 mg, while in severe CKD (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2) it is 50-100 mg. Torsemide is not removed by hemodialysis.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use cautiously. Contraindicated in hepatic coma.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor closely for potential drug interactions and electrolyte imbalances.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use/Emergency Situations:** Torsemide can be administered intravenously when a rapid onset of diuresis is necessary, such as in acute pulmonary edema or other emergency situations.  The IV dose is generally equivalent to the oral dose, administered as a bolus over 2 minutes or as a continuous infusion. Dosage should be adjusted based on patient response and clinical status.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments may be necessary based on renal or hepatic function, concomitant medications, and electrolyte abnormalities. 

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Excessive urination
- Dehydration

- **Lithium:** May increase lithium levels.
- **Antihypertensives:** Additive hypotensive effect.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (FDA). Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
- **Fetal risks:** Potential for electrolyte imbalances and reduced placental perfusion.
- **Breastfeeding:** Torsemide is excreted in breast milk.  Use with caution or avoid breastfeeding while taking torsemide.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter in the loop of Henle, increasing excretion of water and electrolytes.
- **Side Effects:** Excessive urination, electrolyte imbalances, dizziness, headache, muscle cramps.  Rarely: ototoxicity, severe skin reactions, pancreatitis.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, anuria, hepatic coma.
- **Drug Interactions:** NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, CYP2C9 inhibitors, digoxin, lithium, antihypertensives.

- **Dosage:** See dosage section above.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium), creatinine, blood glucose, uric acid, blood pressure, urine output, weight, and renal function.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Often combined with potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, amiloride) or aldosterone antagonists in patients with cirrhosis to prevent hypokalemia.
- May be used with other antihypertensive agents to achieve better blood pressure control.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Monitor renal function, electrolytes, and blood pressure regularly.  Assess for volume depletion.
- **Specific Populations:** Monitor pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, children, and elderly patients closely.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Advise patients to avoid alcohol, maintain adequate hydration, and take precautions when driving or operating machinery due to potential for dizziness.
