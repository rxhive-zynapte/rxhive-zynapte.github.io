      Can Travoprost permanently change eye color?**


      **A:** Yes, Travoprost can cause increased brown pigmentation of the iris,
      which is often permanent.  It may also cause darkening of the eyelids and
      eyelashes, which may be reversible in some patients.

## **Usage**

- Travoprost is prescribed for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. It can be used as first-line monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy.  In pediatric patients, it's used to decrease elevated IOP in those aged 2 months to <18 years with ocular hypertension or pediatric glaucoma.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Prostaglandin analog, Antiglaucoma agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Travoprost is a selective FP prostanoid receptor agonist. It increases the outflow of aqueous humor from the eye, primarily through the uveoscleral pathway and, to a lesser extent, the trabecular meshwork, thereby lowering IOP.

## **Alternate Names**

- International Nonproprietary Name (INN): Travoprost
- **Brand Names:** Travatan Z, Izba, Travatan

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Travoprost lowers IOP by increasing uveoscleral outflow.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Following ocular administration, travoprost is absorbed through the cornea.  
    - **Metabolism:** Travoprost is hydrolyzed in the cornea to the biologically active free acid. Systemic metabolism occurs via fatty acid Î²-oxidation.
    - **Elimination:** Travoprost and its metabolites are primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism and renal excretion.
- **Mode of Action:** Travoprost binds to the FP prostanoid receptor, which increases the formation of matrix metalloproteinases in the ciliary muscle, ultimately increasing uveoscleral outflow.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- One drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening.
- Do not administer more than once daily, as more frequent administration may reduce the IOP-lowering effect.

#### **Children:**
- 2 months to <18 years: One drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening.  Data is limited for the age group 2 months to <3 years.
- Safety and efficacy have not been established in children below the age of 2 months.

#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Diabetes or prior eye surgery should be discussed with the physician before starting treatment.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Travoprost is specifically indicated for open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. It's not typically employed for:

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations** (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest)

### **Dosage Adjustments**

No dose adjustments are typically required based on renal or hepatic dysfunction. However, dose modification may be considered by the physician in specific situations or if used with other IOP-lowering medications.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Ocular hyperemia (eye redness)
- Eye discomfort/irritation/itching/pain
- Blurred vision
- Dry eyes, tearing
- Foreign body sensation
- Eyelid crusting
- Increased eyelash growth (length, thickness, number, pigmentation)
- Darkening of the eyelids
- Increased sensitivity to light

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Iritis, Uveitis
- Macular edema
- Severe allergic reactions (e.g., angioedema, rash, itching, hives)
- Permanent darkening of the iris


### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Permanent darkening of the iris
- Potentially permanent changes in eyelash growth and eyelid skin color

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Severe allergic reactions requiring urgent medical attention
- Worsening of pre-existing eye conditions (e.g., uveitis, macular edema)


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to travoprost or any component of the formulation.
- Pregnancy or women attempting to become pregnant.


## **Drug Interactions**

- No clinically significant drug interactions have been reported. However, inform your healthcare provider about all medications, including OTC drugs and supplements.
- If using other topical ophthalmic medications, administer them at least 5 minutes apart.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Contraindicated. Travoprost may interfere with the maintenance of pregnancy and has been shown to be teratogenic in animal studies.
- **Breastfeeding:** Not recommended unless there are no safer alternatives. It is unknown whether travoprost is excreted in human milk.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** FP prostanoid receptor agonist, increases uveoscleral outflow of aqueous humor.
- **Side Effects:** Ocular hyperemia, eye irritation, blurred vision, changes in eyelashes/eyelids.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, pregnancy.
- **Drug Interactions:** No significant known interactions.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy, not recommended while breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** One drop in affected eye(s) once daily in the evening.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** IOP, eye color, eyelash and eyelid changes.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Travoprost is sometimes used in combination with timolol, a beta-blocker, for additive IOP-lowering effects.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Monitor for eye inflammation, changes in eye pigmentation, and allergic reactions.
- **Specific Populations:**  Contraindicated in pregnancy. Use with caution during breastfeeding.  Safety not established below 2 months of age.
