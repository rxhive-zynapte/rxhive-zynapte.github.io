## **Usage**

- Trazodone is primarily prescribed for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). It is also used off-label for insomnia, anxiety, and alcohol dependence.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Trazodone is classified as a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Trazodone primarily acts by inhibiting serotonin reuptake, increasing serotonin levels in the synaptic cleft.  It also acts as an antagonist at 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors and as an agonist at 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors. This complex interaction with serotonin receptors contributes to its antidepressant and sedative effects.

## **Alternate Names**

- Trazodone hydrochloride
- **Brand Names:** Desyrel®, Oleptro®, Trazorel®


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Trazodone's antidepressant effects are attributed to its SARI properties and receptor binding activities. It affects various neurotransmitters, primarily serotonin, but also histamine and alpha-adrenergic receptors. This combined action helps elevate mood, reduce anxiety, and promote sleep.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Trazodone is well-absorbed orally and extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by the CYP3A4 enzyme. It is eliminated through both renal and hepatic pathways. It reaches steady-state levels in about two days. 
- **Mode of Action:** Trazodone inhibits serotonin reuptake by blocking the serotonin transporter (SERT) and antagonizes 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors. It also acts as a 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor agonist.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Trazodone inhibits SERT, leading to increased serotonin levels. It antagonizes 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors, and demonstrates some affinity for alpha-adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors. 
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism (CYP3A4), followed by renal and biliary excretion.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Depression:** Initial dose is 150 mg/day, divided into multiple doses, taken after a meal or light snack. The dose can be increased by 50 mg/day every 3-4 days, as needed, up to a maximum of 400 mg/day for outpatients and 600 mg/day for inpatients.
- **Insomnia (off-label):** 25-150 mg at bedtime.
- **Anxiety:** 75-300 mg/day.

#### **Children:**

- Trazodone is generally not recommended for children under 18 years old due to limited safety and efficacy data.  Some studies suggest dosing based on body weight, but this requires careful consideration and monitoring by a physician.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initial dose should be reduced (e.g., 100 mg/day) and increased gradually based on tolerance and response. Doses above 100 mg as a single dose should generally be avoided.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution is advised, particularly in severe renal impairment, but dosage adjustment is not usually required.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is recommended, particularly in severe hepatic impairment, due to trazodone's extensive hepatic metabolism. Liver function monitoring might be considered.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with cardiovascular disease, recent myocardial infarction, a history of priapism, or those taking other medications that prolong the QT interval. Careful consideration should be given to patients with bipolar disorder due to the risk of inducing mania or hypomania.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Trazodone is not typically indicated for use in clinical situations like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary use is in the treatment of depression.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on individual response, tolerability, age, and comorbidities.  Consider renal and hepatic function, drug interactions, and the potential for drug-induced QT prolongation.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue
- Headache, blurred vision
- Dry mouth, nausea, constipation
- Orthostatic hypotension

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Suicidal thoughts or behavior (especially in young adults)
- Serotonin syndrome (when combined with other serotonergic drugs)
- Cardiac arrhythmias (including QT prolongation)
- Priapism (prolonged erection)
- Severe allergic reactions

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Potential for withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation (headache, nausea, and malaise), especially after prolonged use.
- Tolerance to sedative effects can develop over time.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Serotonin syndrome
- Cardiac arrhythmias (QT prolongation)
- Priapism
- Severe allergic reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis)


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to trazodone.
- Recent myocardial infarction.
- Concurrent use of MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping MAOIs.
- Alcohol intoxication or concomitant use of hypnotics.

## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP450 Interactions:** Trazodone is metabolized by CYP3A4. Inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin) can increase trazodone levels, while inducers (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine) can decrease levels.
- **Other Interactions:**
    - Other serotonergic drugs (SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans): Increased risk of serotonin syndrome.
    - Drugs that prolong the QT interval (e.g., antiarrhythmics, certain antibiotics): Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
    - CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids): Additive sedative effects.
    - Antihypertensives: Enhanced hypotensive effects.
    - Anticoagulants/antiplatelet drugs: Increased risk of bleeding.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  While there's no definitive category, data suggests a potential risk, though limited.  Close monitoring is needed if used during pregnancy.
- **Fetal Risks:** Potential for fetal harm, though limited data. Discuss risks and benefits with a physician.
- **Breastfeeding:** Trazodone passes into breast milk in small amounts. Monitor infants for adverse effects (e.g., drowsiness).


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** SARI, 5-HT<sub>2A/2C</sub> antagonist, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> agonist.
- **Side Effects:** Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, orthostatic hypotension.  Serious side effects include serotonin syndrome, cardiac arrhythmias, and priapism.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, recent MI, concurrent MAOI use.
- **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers, other serotonergic drugs, QT-prolonging drugs, CNS depressants.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Potential risks; weigh benefits against risks. Close monitoring is essential.
- **Dosage:**  Adults: 150-400 mg/day (outpatient); up to 600 mg/day (inpatient). Elderly: lower initial dose. Insomnia: 25-150 mg at bedtime. Anxiety: 75-300 mg/day.
