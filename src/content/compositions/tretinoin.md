## **Usage**

Tretinoin, whether topical or oral, is primarily used in dermatology and oncology.

Topical tretinoin is prescribed for:

*   **Acne vulgaris:**  It treats comedonal, papular, and pustular acne by increasing skin cell turnover.
*   **Photoaging:**  It reduces fine wrinkles, mottled hyperpigmentation, and roughness caused by sun exposure.

Oral tretinoin is indicated for:

*   **Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL):** It induces differentiation and reduces proliferation of APL cells.  It's often used in combination with arsenic trioxide or chemotherapy.

Pharmacological Classification:

* Topical: Retinoid
* Oral: Antineoplastic, Retinoid

Mechanism of Action (General):

*   Tretinoin is a derivative of Vitamin A (retinoic acid) that binds to specific receptors within cells, influencing gene expression related to cell growth and differentiation.

## **Alternate Names**

*   All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)
*   Retinoic acid

Brand Names:

*   Vesanoid (oral capsules)
*   Retin-A (topical cream, gel, liquid)
*   Avita (topical cream)
*   Renova (topical cream)
*   Stieva-A (topical cream, gel)
*   Retin-A Micro (topical gel)
* Treclin (topical gel, in combination with clindamycin)


## **How It Works**

### Pharmacodynamics:

*   **Topical:** Tretinoin increases the turnover of follicular epithelial cells, reducing comedone formation and treating acne. It also thins the stratum corneum, improving skin texture and reducing wrinkles.
*   **Oral (APL):** Tretinoin induces differentiation of APL cells, halting their uncontrolled proliferation and promoting maturation into normal cells.

### Pharmacokinetics:

*   **Topical:** Minimally absorbed systemically.
*   **Oral:**  Well-absorbed orally. Metabolized primarily in the liver via CYP enzymes (primarily CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and CYP26). Excreted mainly in bile and feces, with a small portion in urine.

### Mode of Action (Cellular/Molecular):

Tretinoin binds to retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs), which are nuclear receptors that regulate gene transcription related to cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.

### Elimination Pathways:

*   **Topical:** Primarily through desquamation of skin cells.
*   **Oral:** Primarily hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion, with a small portion renally excreted.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   **Topical (Acne/Photoaging):** Apply a pea-sized amount to the affected area once daily at bedtime. Start with a lower concentration (0.025% or 0.01%) and increase as tolerated.
*   **Oral (APL):** 45 mg/m²/day orally, divided every 12 hours. Continue until complete remission or up to a maximum of 90 days.

#### **Children:**

*   **Topical:** Not recommended for children under 12 years of age for acne. For other uses, consult a physician for specific recommendations.
*   **Oral (APL):**  Similar dosing to adults (45 mg/m²/day) can be considered, but a lower dose (25 mg/m²/day) may be used to reduce toxicity.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Similar to adult dosing.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No specific dose adjustments typically required for topical use. For oral use, caution is advised, and monitoring is recommended.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** For oral use, dose reduction and close monitoring are recommended.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual patient factors and potential drug interactions.


### **Clinical Use Cases** (Oral Tretinoin)

Oral tretinoin is specifically indicated for APL and not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or general emergency situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments** (Oral Tretinoin)

Dose reduction may be necessary in cases of severe adverse effects, hepatic impairment, or certain drug interactions.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

*   **Topical:** Skin dryness, redness, itching, burning, peeling.
*   **Oral:** Headache, fever, fatigue, weakness, dry skin, mucositis, nausea, vomiting, bone pain, increased risk of bleeding.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

*   **Topical:** Severe skin irritation, allergic reactions.
*   **Oral:** Retinoic acid syndrome (RAS), leukocytosis, severe hypertriglyceridemia, pancreatitis, intracranial hypertension, serious bleeding.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

*   **Topical:**  Potential for skin discoloration.
*   **Oral:** Not applicable, as treatment duration is typically limited.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

*   **Topical:** Severe allergic reactions.
*   **Oral:** RAS, leukocytosis, intracranial hypertension, severe bleeding.



## **Contraindications**

*   **Topical:** Hypersensitivity to tretinoin or any component of the formulation.  Caution in pregnancy, especially first trimester.
*   **Oral:** Hypersensitivity to tretinoin or any component of the formulation. Pregnancy (especially first trimester), breastfeeding.



## **Drug Interactions**

*   **Topical:**  Concurrent use of other topical acne medications, especially those containing peeling agents (e.g., benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid), can increase irritation.  Concomitant use with photosensitizing drugs can increase sun sensitivity.
*   **Oral:**  Numerous drug interactions exist.  Consult a comprehensive drug interaction database for detailed information before prescribing.  Some examples include:
    *   Vitamin A supplements: Can increase the risk of vitamin A toxicity.
    *   Tetracycline antibiotics: Can increase photosensitivity.
    *   Anticoagulants: Effects may be altered.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

*   **Pregnancy:** 
    * Topical: Use with caution, especially in the first trimester.
    * Oral: Contraindicated.  Effective contraception is essential during and for one month after treatment.
*   **Breastfeeding:** 
    * Topical: Generally considered low risk due to minimal systemic absorption. Avoid applying to the nipple area.
    * Oral: Contraindicated.


## **Drug Profile Summary**
