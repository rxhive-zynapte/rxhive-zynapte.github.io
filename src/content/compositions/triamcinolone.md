## **Usage**

Triamcinolone is prescribed for a variety of conditions, including:

*   **Allergic conditions:** Seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis, drug reactions, serum sickness
*   **Dermatological diseases:**  Atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, lichen planus, pemphigus, and other inflammatory skin disorders.
*   **Endocrine disorders:** Adrenocortical insufficiency
*   **Gastrointestinal diseases:** Ulcerative colitis
*   **Hematologic disorders:**  Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (for specific formulations only), autoimmune hemolytic anemia
*   **Neoplastic diseases:** Leukemia and lymphomas (as palliative therapy)
*   **Nervous system:** Multiple sclerosis, cerebral edema
*   **Ophthalmic diseases:** Uveitis, sympathetic ophthalmia, temporal arteritis
*   **Renal diseases:** Nephrotic syndrome
*   **Respiratory diseases:** Asthma, allergic bronchitis, pulmonary fibrosis
*   **Rheumatic disorders:** Rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, bursitis, gouty arthritis

**Pharmacological classification:** Triamcinolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid, a type of corticosteroid.  

**Mechanism of action:** Triamcinolone exerts its effects by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm, which then translocate to the nucleus and modulate gene transcription. This leads to a decrease in the production of inflammatory mediators and suppression of the immune response.

## **Alternate Names**

Triamcinolone acetonide, triamcinolone diacetate, triamcinolone hexacetonide

**Brand Names:**  Kenalog, Aristospan, Trivaris, Triesence (intravitreal),  Nasacort AQ (nasal spray) and various other brand names depending on the formulation and country.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Triamcinolone binds to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors. This complex then interacts with DNA to modify the transcription of multiple genes, leading to:

*   **Anti-inflammatory effects:** Reduced production of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and cytokines.
*   **Immunosuppressive effects:** Inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation and function.
*   **Metabolic effects:** Increased gluconeogenesis, protein catabolism, and fat redistribution.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Varies depending on the route of administration. Oral bioavailability is relatively low. Intramuscular and intra-articular injections provide sustained release.
*   **Metabolism:** Primarily hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4 enzymes.
*   **Elimination:** Excretion occurs via both renal and fecal routes.


**Mode of action:** Triamcinolone exerts its effects primarily through genomic mechanisms. The drug-receptor complex binds to specific DNA sequences called glucocorticoid response elements, which are present in the promoter regions of target genes involved in inflammation and immune regulation.


**Receptor binding:** Triamcinolone binds to glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm.


**Elimination pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism followed by renal and fecal excretion.

## **Dosage**

Dosage varies considerably depending on the indication, route of administration, and patient factors. 


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   **Intramuscular (IM):**  Initial dose often 40-60 mg, adjusted based on response (20-80 mg range common). Injections typically repeated every 4-6 weeks as needed for certain conditions.
*   **Intra-articular:** 2.5-40 mg depending on joint size, repeated as needed.
*   **Intralesional:** 1-5 mg per injection site, maximum 30 mg/day.
*   **Topical:** Apply a thin layer to the affected area two to four times daily.
*   **Intranasal:**  For allergic rhinitis:  110-220 mcg per nostril daily.

#### **Children:**

*   **IM:** 0.11-1.6 mg/kg/day divided every 3-4 hours.  Dose and frequency must be adjusted according to age, condition, and response. Pediatric dosing guidelines vary significantly depending on the condition being treated.
*   **Intra-articular:**  Dose adjusted by weight and joint size. Consider starting at lower end of adult dose range.
*   **Topical:** Apply a thin layer to the affected area two to four times daily. 
*   **Intranasal:** 55-110 mcg/nostril daily depending on age and condition.


#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Use the lowest effective dose and monitor closely for adverse effects.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Caution advised; dose adjustments may be necessary.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Close monitoring required.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dose adjustment may be necessary for conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and osteoporosis.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations vary widely based on the specific clinical situation.  Consult specialized medical literature for detailed guidance.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Consider dose adjustments based on patient response, disease severity, and the presence of renal or hepatic impairment.

## **Contraindications**

*   Systemic fungal infections (except for localized joint injections)
*   Hypersensitivity to triamcinolone
*   Epidural administration is contraindicated due to the risk of serious neurologic events.
*   Caution in patients with tuberculosis due to the risk of reactivation.

## **Drug Interactions**

*   CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin) can decrease triamcinolone levels.
*   CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin) can increase triamcinolone levels.
*   NSAIDs can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
*   Live vaccines should be avoided.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

*   **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  C (some risk; benefits may outweigh risks in certain situations)
*   Triamcinolone can cross the placenta and may pose risks to the fetus.
*   Limited data on breast milk excretion; caution advised.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** Binds to glucocorticoid receptors, modulating gene transcription and suppressing inflammation/immunity.
*   **Side Effects:**  Range from common (weight gain, insomnia) to serious (infections, osteoporosis).
*   **Contraindications:** Systemic fungal infections, hypersensitivity.
*   **Drug Interactions:** CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors, NSAIDs, live vaccines.
