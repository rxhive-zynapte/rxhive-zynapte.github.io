## **Usage**

Tribasic calcium phosphate is primarily used to prevent or treat hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels) in individuals who don't get enough calcium from their diet.  It's also prescribed for conditions caused by low calcium levels, such as:

* **Osteoporosis:**  A condition characterized by decreased bone mineral density, increasing the risk of fractures.
* **Osteomalacia/Rickets:** Softening of the bones due to vitamin D deficiency, leading to bone pain and muscle weakness.
* **Hypoparathyroidism:** Decreased activity of the parathyroid gland, resulting in low calcium levels.
* **Latent Tetany:** A muscle disease characterized by muscle spasms and cramps due to low calcium.

It's also given to ensure adequate calcium intake in specific populations like pregnant or nursing women, postmenopausal women, and individuals taking certain medications (e.g., phenytoin, phenobarbital, prednisone).

**Pharmacological Classification:**  Mineral Supplement, Calcium Supplement

**Mechanism of Action:** Tribasic calcium phosphate provides a source of elemental calcium, which is essential for various physiological processes.  It works by directly supplementing calcium levels in the body, thereby supporting normal nerve, cell, muscle, and bone function. It helps to strengthen bones and prevent bone loss.


## **Alternate Names**

* Tricalcium phosphate
* Bone phosphate of lime
* Calcium phosphate


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Calcium is crucial for numerous bodily functions, including:

* **Bone Formation and Maintenance:** Calcium is a primary component of bone tissue, contributing to its strength and structure.
* **Nerve and Muscle Function:**  Calcium plays a critical role in nerve impulse transmission and muscle contraction.
* **Blood Clotting:** Calcium is essential for the coagulation cascade, facilitating blood clot formation.
* **Cellular Signaling:** Calcium acts as a secondary messenger in various intracellular signaling pathways.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Calcium absorption from tribasic calcium phosphate occurs primarily in the small intestine and is influenced by factors like vitamin D levels, stomach acidity, and the presence of other nutrients.
* **Metabolism:** Calcium is not metabolized in the traditional sense. It's absorbed, distributed, and either utilized by the body or excreted.
* **Elimination:** Calcium is primarily excreted through the kidneys in urine.  Some calcium is also lost in feces and sweat.


## **Dosage**

**Standard Dosage**

**Adults:**

* The recommended adult dosage ranges from 800 to 1200 mg of elemental calcium per day, although higher doses (up to 1600mg) might be used for specific conditions. Doses greater than 600 mg should be divided and taken throughout the day for optimal absorption. It is also important to remember not to consume over 500mg per dose due to limited absorption.

**Children:**

* Dosages vary significantly based on age, ranging from 200 mg/day for infants to 1300 mg/day for adolescents.

**Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Similar to adults, with adjustments as needed based on renal function and dietary intake.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction or avoidance may be necessary due to reduced calcium excretion.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Generally, no specific dosage adjustments are needed.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dose adjustments might be required for certain conditions.


## **Side Effects**

**Common Side Effects:**

* Constipation
* Upset Stomach
* Gas
* Bloating


**Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

* Hypercalcemia (high calcium levels): Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, confusion, increased thirst and urination.
* Kidney Stones


## **Contraindications**

* Hypercalcemia
* Kidney stones
* Severe kidney disease
* Hypophosphatemia (low phosphate levels)

## **Drug Interactions**

* **Digoxin:** Calcium can reduce digoxin absorption.
* **Cellulose Sodium Phosphate:** May decrease calcium absorption.
* **Bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate):** Calcium can reduce bisphosphonate absorption.
* **Tetracycline Antibiotics (e.g., doxycycline, minocycline):** Calcium can decrease tetracycline absorption.
* **Estramustine:** Calcium may interfere with estramustine absorption.
* **Levothyroxine:**  Calcium can interfere with levothyroxine absorption.
* **Quinolone Antibiotics (e.g., ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin):** Calcium can interfere with quinolone absorption.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Generally considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding when taken within recommended dosages.  However, excessive calcium intake should be avoided.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Supplements calcium levels, supporting normal bone, nerve, muscle, and cellular function.
* **Side Effects:** Constipation, upset stomach, gas, bloating. Rarely, hypercalcemia and kidney stones.
* **Contraindications:** Hypercalcemia, kidney stones, severe kidney disease, hypophosphatemia.
* **Drug Interactions:**  Several drug interactions; consult a drug interaction database.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally safe within recommended dosages.
* **Dosage:** Varies based on age and medical condition; typically 800-1200 mg/day for adults.
