## **Usage**

Triclosan is prescribed for the treatment and prevention of topical bacterial and fungal infections, such as acne.  Its pharmacological classification is antimicrobial/antiseptic. Triclosan's mechanism of action involves inhibiting the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (ENR) enzyme, which is essential for bacterial fatty acid synthesis. This disruption of lipid synthesis leads to bacterial cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

Triclosan is also marketed under names such as Microban® (for plastics and clothing) and Biofresh® (for acrylic fibers). Brand names include Dermaprot, Triclotrex-B, and Ting, among others.  Different brands containing Triclosan exist in various countries.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Triclosan exerts its antimicrobial effect by inhibiting ENR, an enzyme crucial for bacterial fatty acid synthesis. This leads to the disruption of bacterial cell membrane integrity and ultimately cell death.  At lower concentrations, it is bacteriostatic (inhibits bacterial growth), and at higher concentrations, it is bactericidal (kills bacteria).

**Pharmacokinetics:** Triclosan is primarily used topically. Absorption through the skin is limited, but it can be absorbed through the oral mucosa when used in toothpaste or mouthwash. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in urine and feces. It is also known to be present in breast milk. Elimination pathways involve both hepatic and renal excretion.

**Mode of Action:** Triclosan targets the ENR enzyme, blocking fatty acid synthesis in bacteria.  This disruption affects the construction and function of bacterial cell membranes and other crucial cellular processes, leading to cell death.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  The primary mode of action is enzyme inhibition (ENR inhibition). There is some evidence suggesting potential endocrine disruption through interaction with hormone receptors, but this area requires further research.

## **Dosage**

Triclosan dosage depends on the formulation and the specific condition being treated.  It is crucial to follow the instructions provided with the product.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

The concentration of triclosan in products varies. For topical use, concentrations up to 0.3% are common in many countries. For mouthwash, concentrations up to 0.03% are permitted.

#### **Children:**

The use of Triclosan in children should be under the guidance of a physician. Some countries restrict its use in certain products for children under specific ages due to concerns about potential health effects. Always check local regulations and consult a doctor.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution, monitoring for potential skin irritation.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically recommended for topical use, but caution is advised.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Use with caution as triclosan is metabolized in the liver.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consult with a physician regarding concurrent use with other medications or in the presence of pre-existing conditions such as thyroid disorders or allergies.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Triclosan is not typically used in the clinical settings described (Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use, Emergency Situations) in its pure form.  However, it is found in some hospital-grade antiseptic washes and surgical scrubs, though its usage has decreased due to concerns about bacterial resistance.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments may be necessary for individuals with sensitivities or allergies to Triclosan. Always start with the lowest effective concentration and monitor for adverse reactions.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Skin irritation, dryness, itching, redness, burning sensation, and contact dermatitis are among the reported common side effects.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Allergic reactions requiring medical attention can occur. There are concerns about potential endocrine disruption and the development of antibiotic resistance with long-term use.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential long-term effects are still being investigated, including endocrine disruption, antibiotic resistance, and potential impacts on the microbiome. Some studies indicate a possible link between triclosan exposure and allergic reactions, particularly in children.



### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe allergic reactions are the most clinically significant ADRs, necessitating immediate discontinuation of use and seeking medical advice.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity or known allergy to triclosan is a contraindication. Use with caution on broken or damaged skin. Some studies suggest avoiding use in pregnant or breastfeeding women and young children due to potential developmental and hormonal effects.


## **Drug Interactions**

Limited information is available on clinically significant drug interactions. Some studies suggest potential interactions with thyroid medications and certain antibiotics. More research is needed to fully understand triclosan's drug interactions.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Due to the potential for hormonal disruption and developmental effects, the use of triclosan during pregnancy and breastfeeding is generally discouraged unless deemed absolutely necessary by a physician. Triclosan has been detected in breast milk and umbilical cord blood, raising concerns about fetal exposure.



## **Drug Profile Summary**
