## **Usage**

- Trifarotene is prescribed for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris (commonly known as acne) on the face and/or trunk in patients 9 years of age and older. It is effective in treating acne with comedones, papules, and pustules.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Retinoid.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Trifarotene is a retinoic acid receptor (RAR) agonist, specifically targeting the gamma (γ) subtype.  It modulates gene expression related to cell differentiation and inflammation within the skin, leading to reduced acne lesions. The exact mechanism of how trifarotene ameliorates acne is not fully understood.

## **Alternate Names**

- There are no widely used alternate names for trifarotene.
- **Brand Name:** Aklief®


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Trifarotene's primary effect is on the skin, reducing inflammation and normalizing skin cell turnover (keratinization). This helps to prevent the formation of comedones, papules, and pustules. At recommended doses, it doesn't prolong the QT interval.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Trifarotene is minimally absorbed systemically after topical application. Steady-state concentrations are reached within approximately two weeks.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and to a lesser extent by CYP2B6.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily excreted in the feces.
- **Mode of Action:** Trifarotene binds to and activates RAR-gamma receptors in the skin. This modulates the expression of target genes involved in inflammation and cell differentiation, ultimately reducing acne lesions.
- **Receptor Binding:** Agonist of retinoic acid receptors (RAR), specifically the gamma subtype.
- **Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** No significant enzyme inhibition or neurotransmitter modulation effects are known at the recommended topical dose.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily fecal excretion, with minimal renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Apply a thin layer of Trifarotene 0.005% cream to the affected areas of the face and/or trunk once daily, in the evening, on clean and dry skin. One pump actuation is generally sufficient for the entire face, while two are enough for the upper trunk. An additional pump can be used for the middle and lower back if affected.

#### **Children (9 years and older):**

The dosage for children aged 9 years and older is the same as for adults.  Safety and efficacy in children younger than 9 years old have not been established.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are recommended for elderly patients, but caution is advised due to potential age-related skin sensitivities.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific dosage adjustments are routinely necessary, but individual patient assessment should guide any modifications.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Trifarotene is intended for topical use only and has not been studied or indicated for use in clinical scenarios such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It should not be used in these settings.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific dosage adjustments are indicated for renal/hepatic impairment, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms. Clinical response and tolerance should guide dosage optimization for individual patients.




## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

Application site reactions: Erythema, scaling, dryness, stinging/burning, itching, irritation, pain, rash, swelling, and discoloration. Sunburn, acne, and allergic dermatitis may also occur.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

While rare with topical application, severe or persistent irritation, allergic reactions (e.g., hives, angioedema), or unusual changes in vision should prompt immediate medical evaluation.

### **Long-Term Effects**

No specific long-term adverse effects have been identified with topical trifarotene use. However, long-term safety data is still limited.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs are uncommon with topical use. Severe allergic reactions or significant skin irritation require immediate discontinuation and medical attention.



## **Contraindications**

- Pregnancy
- Women planning to become pregnant
- Hypersensitivity to trifarotene or any of the excipients in the cream


## **Drug Interactions**

- Concomitant use of other topical acne medications, especially those with drying or irritant effects (e.g., benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, resorcinol, sulfur), may increase the risk of cumulative irritation.
- Topical or systemic medications that increase photosensitivity (e.g., aminolevulinic acid, methoxsalen, porfimer sodium, verteporfin) might exacerbate sun sensitivity during trifarotene treatment.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  Contraindicated in pregnancy (Category X). Trifarotene is teratogenic in animal studies.  
- **Fetal Risks:**  Significant risk of birth defects and fetal harm if used during pregnancy.
- **Drug Excretion in Breast Milk:** It is unknown if trifarotene is excreted in human milk. 
- **Neonatal Side Effects:** Potential for neonatal exposure if applied to the chest area.
- **Alternative Safer Options:**  Topical azelaic acid or benzoyl peroxide may be considered for acne treatment during pregnancy and breastfeeding.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  RAR-gamma agonist, modulating gene expression related to cell differentiation and inflammation.
- **Side Effects:** Application site irritation (erythema, scaling, dryness, burning), photosensitivity.
- **Contraindications:** Pregnancy, planned pregnancy, hypersensitivity.
- **Drug Interactions:**  Additive irritation with other topical acne treatments, increased photosensitivity with certain medications.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy; caution advised during breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** Apply a thin layer once daily to affected areas in the evening.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Monitor for treatment response, local skin reactions, and signs of photosensitivity.


## **Popular Combinations**

While trifarotene can be used as monotherapy, combination therapies are often used in clinical practice for more severe or resistant acne. However, due to the potential for additive irritation, combining trifarotene with other topical acne medications should be done cautiously and under the guidance of a physician.  


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess for history of eczema, allergies, and skin sensitivities. Advise patients about sun sensitivity and recommend sun protection measures.
- **Specific Populations:**
    - **Pregnant Women:** Contraindicated.
    - **Breastfeeding Mothers:**  Avoid application to chest/nipple area and minimize overall exposure.
    - **Children & Elderly:** Same dosage as adults; consider potential increased skin sensitivity.
