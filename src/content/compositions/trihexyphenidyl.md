## **Usage**

Trihexyphenidyl is prescribed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease symptoms (tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia) and for drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), such as dystonia, akathisia, and parkinsonism, caused by antipsychotic medications. It belongs to the anticholinergic class of drugs.  Trihexyphenidyl works by blocking the activity of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter in the brain, which helps to rebalance the levels of dopamine and acetylcholine, thus reducing the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease and EPS.

## **Alternate Names**

Trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride is also known as benzhexol hydrochloride internationally. Brand names include Artane and Pacitane.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Trihexyphenidyl primarily acts as an anticholinergic agent, meaning it blocks the effects of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors within the central nervous system. This leads to a reduction in cholinergic activity, which helps to alleviate some of the symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease and drug-induced parkinsonism.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:**  Trihexyphenidyl is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
* **Metabolism:** It is metabolized in the liver.
* **Elimination:** It is primarily excreted in the urine. Specific information on CYP enzyme involvement is limited.


**Mode of Action:** At the cellular level, trihexyphenidyl competitively inhibits the binding of acetylcholine to muscarinic receptors, primarily M1 receptors in the central nervous system.  This reduces the effects of excessive cholinergic activity, which contributes to the motor symptoms observed in Parkinson's disease and drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions. The precise mechanism of action in alleviating symptoms is complex and involves interactions within the basal ganglia circuitry.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Trihexyphenidyl's main action is the competitive antagonism of muscarinic M1 receptors.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Initial dosage is typically 1 mg per day, taken orally. This can be gradually increased by 2 mg increments every 3-5 days until optimal symptom control is achieved. The usual maintenance dosage ranges from 6-10 mg per day, divided into three or four doses, taken with meals. The maximum recommended dose generally does not exceed 15 mg per day.

#### **Children:**

Use in children is not recommended due to limited clinical experience and potential for serious side effects. However, if necessary, dosage must be determined by the child's physician based on weight and clinical condition. Start with a very low dose and titrate cautiously, monitoring carefully for adverse effects.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose (1 mg per day) and titrate cautiously, as elderly patients are more susceptible to adverse effects.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustment may be necessary. Monitor renal function and adjust the dose accordingly.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment may be necessary. Monitor liver function and adjust the dose accordingly.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with glaucoma, cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal or urinary tract obstruction, and prostatic hypertrophy.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Trihexyphenidyl is not indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are based on patient response and tolerance. Careful titration is necessary, especially in elderly patients and those with renal or hepatic impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Dry mouth, blurred vision, dizziness, nausea, nervousness, constipation, drowsiness, urinary retention.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Glaucoma, cardiac arrhythmias, hallucinations, delirium, paralytic ileus, heat stroke, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).

### **Long-Term Effects**

Cognitive impairment, memory problems, and dependence.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Any signs of NMS (fever, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, autonomic instability), angle-closure glaucoma, or cardiac arrhythmias should prompt immediate discontinuation of trihexyphenidyl and supportive medical care.

## **Contraindications**

* Narrow-angle glaucoma
* Hypersensitivity to trihexyphenidyl
* Gastrointestinal obstruction
* Urinary retention
* Prostatic hypertrophy

## **Drug Interactions**

Trihexyphenidyl may interact with other anticholinergic medications (e.g., antihistamines, tricyclic antidepressants),  enhancing anticholinergic effects. It can also interact with certain antipsychotics,  levodopa,  and  medications that prolong the QT interval. Alcohol,  barbiturates, and opioids can have additive sedative effects when combined with trihexyphenidyl.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Safety Category: C.  Trihexyphenidyl should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  Consult with a specialist.  

While it is unknown if trihexyphenidyl is excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when administering it to nursing mothers.  Monitor infants for potential anticholinergic effects.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Anticholinergic agent, blocks muscarinic M1 receptors in the CNS.
* **Side Effects:**  Dry mouth, blurred vision, dizziness, constipation, nausea, urinary retention, cognitive impairment, hallucinations (rare).
* **Contraindications:** Narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, GI obstruction.
* **Drug Interactions:** Other anticholinergics, antipsychotics, levodopa, QT prolonging drugs.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution. Category C.
* **Dosage:**  1-15 mg/day; individualize, titrate cautiously.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for adverse effects, including cognitive changes,  glaucoma,  and cardiac arrhythmias.

## **Popular Combinations**

Trihexyphenidyl may be used in combination with levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.  Dose adjustments of both drugs are often necessary to optimize efficacy and minimize adverse effects.

## **Precautions**

Screen for glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, and urinary retention.  Avoid in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Use with caution in elderly patients. Monitor for cognitive changes, particularly in the elderly.
