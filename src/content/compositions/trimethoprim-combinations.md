## **Usage**

Trimethoprim combinations, primarily trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), also known as co-trimoxazole, are prescribed for various bacterial infections.  These include urinary tract infections (UTIs), respiratory tract infections (including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia), otitis media, gastrointestinal infections, skin and soft tissue infections, and certain other infections like toxoplasmosis.  

**Pharmacological Classification:** Antibiotic

**Mechanism of Action:** TMP/SMX is a synergistic combination of two antibiotics. Trimethoprim inhibits bacterial dihydrofolate reductase, and sulfamethoxazole inhibits bacterial dihydropteroate synthase. Both these enzymes are essential in the bacterial folic acid synthesis pathway.  By inhibiting these two sequential steps, TMP/SMX effectively blocks bacterial DNA synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

* Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX)
* Co-trimoxazole
* TMP-SMZ or SMZ-TMP

**Brand Names:** Bactrim®, Septra®, Sulfatrim®, Co-trimoxazole


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  TMP/SMX exerts a bactericidal effect by disrupting the folic acid synthesis pathway, essential for bacterial DNA synthesis.  This leads to impaired cell growth and ultimately, bacterial death.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole are rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration.
* **Metabolism:** Sulfamethoxazole is partially metabolized in the liver by the CYP2C9 system. Trimethoprim is minimally metabolized.
* **Elimination:** Both drugs are primarily excreted in the urine, largely unchanged. Trimethoprim is also removed by dialysis.

**Mode of Action:**  TMP/SMX acts by sequential blockade of folic acid synthesis pathway in bacteria.

* **Sulfamethoxazole:** Inhibits dihydropteroate synthase, preventing the formation of dihydrofolic acid.
* **Trimethoprim:**  Inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, preventing the conversion of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **UTI:** 100 mg TMP every 12 hours or 200 mg TMP every 24 hours for 10 days.  Alternatively, one double-strength tablet (160 mg TMP/800 mg SMX) every 12 hours for 10-14 days.
* **Other Infections:** Dosing varies depending on the infection.  Consult specific guidelines.

#### **Children:**

* Dosing is weight-based, typically 4 mg/kg TMP every 12 hours (up to a maximum of 160 mg TMP) for most infections. Adjust dose for severe infections.
* *Pediatric Safety Considerations:* Avoid use in neonates less than 6 weeks of age, especially premature infants, due to the risk of kernicterus.  Use cautiously in infants younger than 2 months.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment may be required based on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustments are necessary based on creatinine clearance.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution is advised, though specific dose adjustments are not usually necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor closely for potential interactions, especially in patients with diabetes, folate deficiency, or those receiving other drugs that affect potassium levels (like ACE inhibitors).

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage in these settings should be individualized based on patient factors and the severity of infection.  Consult infectious disease specialists for guidance in these situations.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Refer to the detailed dosing guidelines in the sections above and consider drug monitoring as needed.




## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

* Nausea, vomiting

* Rash, itching
* Diarrhoea
* Headache


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
* Blood disorders (e.g., agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia)
* *Clostridioides difficile*-associated diarrhea
* Liver damage (hepatitis, jaundice)
* Hyperkalemia
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis


### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential for bone marrow suppression and folate deficiency with prolonged use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

See "Rare but Serious Side Effects"



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to trimethoprim or sulfonamides
* Megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency
* Marked hepatic impairment
* Severe renal impairment (CrCl <15 ml/min, unless monitored)
* Pregnancy (especially first trimester)
* Neonates < 6 weeks of age



## **Drug Interactions**

* **CYP450 Interactions:** Sulfamethoxazole is a CYP2C9 inhibitor.
* **Other Interactions:**  ACE inhibitors (increased risk of hyperkalemia), certain diuretics, warfarin, methotrexate, some oral hypoglycemics, dofetilide.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  D (contraindicated, especially in the first trimester)
* **Fetal Risks:**  Increased risk of congenital malformations (neural tube defects, cardiovascular defects) due to folate antagonism.
* **Breastfeeding:**  Small amounts are excreted in breast milk.  Generally considered acceptable for short-term use in healthy, term infants, but caution is advised. Avoid use in infants younger than 2 months of age.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits sequential steps in bacterial folic acid synthesis.
* **Side Effects:** Nausea, vomiting, rash, pruritus, diarrhea; rarely severe allergic reactions, blood disorders, liver damage.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency, severe hepatic/renal impairment, pregnancy, neonates <6 weeks.
* **Drug Interactions:** ACE inhibitors, warfarin, methotrexate, certain diuretics.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated in pregnancy. Use with caution during breastfeeding.
* **Dosage:** Varies with infection and patient factors. Standard adult dose for UTI is 100-200 mg TMP every 12-24 hours for 10 days.
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  Complete blood count, renal function, liver enzymes, potassium levels (especially with long-term use or in at-risk patients).


## **Popular Combinations**

Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). The combination is more effective than either drug alone due to synergistic activity.


## **Precautions**

* Assess renal and hepatic function before and during therapy.
* Monitor for signs of hypersensitivity or blood dyscrasias.
* Supplement with folic acid if necessary.
