## **Usage**

Triticum Vulgare extract, also known as wheat germ extract, is primarily used to treat skin conditions characterized by inflammation and itching, such as decubitus ulcers (bedsores), skin lesions, and burns. It is also used for vaginal inflammation, itching, and vulvar dystrophy, as well as in the treatment of vaginal yeast infections. Its pharmacological classification can be broadly categorized as an anti-inflammatory and emollient agent.  The mechanism of action involves promoting skin repair by facilitating new tissue growth and reducing the production of inflammatory chemicals.  It contains vitamin E, which acts as a skin conditioning agent. Additionally, Triticum Vulgare extract helps in wound healing and skin regeneration due to its antioxidant properties. When used for yeast infections, it helps alleviate symptoms like vaginal dryness, pain, burning, itching, and discharge. For dental application, it can improve gingival health and reduce plaque accumulation, effectively controlling gingival inflammation as an adjuvant treatment.

## **Alternate Names**

* Wheat germ extract
* Triticum aestivum extract
* Oil of wheat germ
* Triticum aestivum germ oil
* Wheat germ oil


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Triticum Vulgare extract promotes tissue regeneration by increasing fibroblast and endothelial cell proliferation. It modulates the inflammatory response by reducing the expression of inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6, TNFÎ±, prostaglandin E2, and nitric oxide.  It enhances fibronectin production and its localization in the extracellular matrix, crucial for cell differentiation and migration during wound healing. Improves gingival health by reducing plaque accumulation and inflammation.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Detailed information regarding the absorption, metabolism, and elimination of topically applied Triticum Vulgare extract is limited. Systemic absorption is expected to be minimal.  For intravaginal use, systemic effects have not been well-studied. The elimination pathways are not clearly defined. However, for oral use as a spray, after two weeks of daily use, no systemic side effects were observed.
