## **Usage**

- Tropicamide is prescribed for inducing mydriasis (pupil dilation) and cycloplegia (paralysis of accommodation) for ophthalmic examinations and surgical procedures.  
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Anticholinergic, antimuscarinic agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Tropicamide blocks the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors in the eye, inhibiting the constriction of the pupil and ciliary muscle contraction, leading to pupil dilation and paralysis of accommodation.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:**  Tropicamide ophthalmic solution.
- **Brand Names:** Mydriacyl, Tropicacyl, Mydral, Ocu-Tropic, Ophthalmicmyd, Minims Tropicamide, Tropigen, Skiacol (in combination with cyclopentolate).

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Tropicamide competitively antagonizes acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors located in the iris sphincter and ciliary muscles. This antagonism results in pupil dilation and cycloplegia.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Tropicamide is administered topically to the eye. Systemic absorption can occur, especially with higher concentrations or prolonged use.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily hepatic metabolism.
    - **Elimination:** Renal excretion.  Specific details on CYP enzyme involvement are not widely documented.
- **Mode of Action:** Tropicamide's mode of action involves competitive and reversible binding to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (specifically M3 subtype) in the eye, preventing acetylcholine from binding and exerting its effects. This leads to relaxation of the iris sphincter and ciliary muscles.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Tropicamide acts as a reversible competitive antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. There is no significant inhibition of enzymes or modulation of other neurotransmitters documented.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily eliminated through hepatic metabolism with subsequent renal excretion. Limited information is available on the specific metabolic pathways or the role of CYP enzymes.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Refraction:** 1-2 drops of 1% solution instilled into the eye(s), repeated after 5 minutes. An additional drop can be instilled if the examination is delayed (20-30 minutes).
- **Funduscopic Examination:** 1-2 drops of 0.5% solution instilled 15-20 minutes before examination.
- **Frequency:** As needed for examination or procedure.
- **Maximum dosage:**  Not explicitly defined, but use the lowest effective dose.

#### **Children:**

- Dosage should be determined by the physician based on age and weight. Generally, lower concentrations (0.5%) are preferred.
- **Pediatric Safety Considerations:** Children, especially infants and those with certain neurological conditions (e.g., Down syndrome, spastic paralysis, brain damage), are more susceptible to systemic anticholinergic side effects. Use with extreme caution. Avoid in infants less than 3 months old.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Use with caution due to potential for increased intraocular pressure. Monitor closely.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustments may be necessary depending on the severity of impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments may be needed due to potential impact on metabolism.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use cautiously in patients with conditions like hypertension, hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, and cardiac disorders.

### **Clinical Use Cases:**

- **Intubation:** Tropicamide is not routinely used for intubation.
- **Surgical Procedures:**  Can be used for ophthalmic surgical procedures requiring mydriasis. Dosage as directed by the surgeon.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Tropicamide is not typically used in this context.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Not a standard ICU medication.
- **Emergency Situations:** Not generally used in emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

- Dose modifications based on renal or hepatic impairment, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms are determined on a case-by-case basis by the physician.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

- Blurred vision
- Transient stinging
- Increased sensitivity to light (photophobia)
- Dry mouth
- Headache

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions (hives, difficulty breathing, swelling)
- Tachycardia or bradycardia, arrhythmia
- Psychotic reactions, behavioral disturbances
- Increased intraocular pressure, especially in patients predisposed to glaucoma

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- No specific long-term side effects are documented for typical ophthalmic use, but prolonged use can lead to local irritation, hyperemia, edema, and conjunctivitis.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Clinically significant ADRs include acute angle-closure glaucoma (in susceptible individuals), systemic anticholinergic toxicity (especially in children), and allergic reactions.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to tropicamide or any components of the formulation.
- Primary angle-closure glaucoma, narrow anterior chamber angle.
- Patients with a shallow anterior chamber unless gonioscopic observation is possible.



## **Drug Interactions**

- Other antimuscarinic agents (e.g., antihistamines, antidepressants, antipsychotics): Additive anticholinergic effects.
- Amantadine: Increased anticholinergic side effects.
- Ophthalmic cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., pilocarpine, carbachol): Reduced efficacy of miotics.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (US FDA). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Use only if clearly needed.
- **Fetal risks:** Potential for fetal harm is unknown.
- **Breastfeeding:** It is unknown if tropicamide is excreted in breast milk. Exercise caution when administering to nursing mothers. Consider applying pressure to the lacrimal sac for 1-2 minutes after instillation to minimize systemic absorption.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Anticholinergic, blocks acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors in the eye.
- **Side Effects:** Blurred vision, stinging, photophobia, dry mouth, headache. Rarely: allergic reactions, tachycardia, psychotic reactions, increased intraocular pressure.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, angle-closure glaucoma, narrow anterior chamber angle.
- **Drug Interactions:** Other anticholinergic agents, amantadine, ophthalmic cholinesterase inhibitors.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution. Safety not established.
- **Dosage:**  See detailed dosage section above.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Pupil size, intraocular pressure (especially in at-risk patients), heart rate, and observe for systemic anticholinergic effects.

## **Popular Combinations**

- **Phenylephrine + Tropicamide:** This combination is used for mydriasis, providing both an alpha-adrenergic agonist (phenylephrine) and antimuscarinic (tropicamide) effect for enhanced pupillary dilation.
- **Cyclopentolate + Tropicamide:** This combination is used for cycloplegic refraction, providing more effective cycloplegia than tropicamide alone, especially in children.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess for narrow angles/glaucoma risk, cardiac conditions, and hypersensitivity to anticholinergics.
- **Specific Populations:** See Special Cases under Dosage.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Blurred vision and photophobia are common. Advise patients to avoid driving or operating machinery until vision returns to normal. Wear sunglasses to minimize photophobia.
