## **Usage**

Troxerutin is a vasoprotective agent, a flavonoid derivative used to treat conditions related to poor blood circulation. It is commonly prescribed for:

- Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI)
- Varicose veins
- Hemorrhoids
- Diabetic retinopathy

It works by:

- Strengthening capillary walls
- Reducing capillary permeability and leakage
- Improving blood flow by decreasing blood viscosity
- Acting as an antioxidant

## **Alternate Names**

- Venoruton
- Troxevasin
- Trihydroxyethylrutoside


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Troxerutin exerts its therapeutic effects primarily through its actions on the vascular system. It strengthens capillary walls, reduces capillary permeability, improves blood flow by decreasing viscosity, and exhibits antioxidant properties. These actions contribute to alleviating symptoms associated with venous insufficiency, such as edema, pain, and leg heaviness.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Troxerutin is readily absorbed after oral administration. It is partially metabolized in the liver by glucuronidation. It is widely distributed in the body, with preferential accumulation in the endothelium of blood vessels. The elimination half-life is approximately 18.3 hours, and excretion occurs primarily through the feces, with a smaller portion eliminated in the urine.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Oral: 600-1200 mg daily, divided into multiple doses, usually taken with meals.

Topical: Apply gel to the affected area 2-3 times daily.


#### **Children:**

Safety and efficacy not established; use is generally not recommended.


#### **Special Cases:**

**Elderly Patients:**  No specific dosage adjustments are typically required, but start with a lower dose and monitor for side effects. Consider renal/hepatic function.

**Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use with caution; dose adjustment may be needed.

**Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution; dose adjustment may be needed.

**Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution advised for patients with respiratory disease, heart disease, epilepsy, or low blood pressure.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosages for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not specifically addressed in the provided information.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be necessary based on individual patient factors, including renal/hepatic dysfunction and other medical conditions.



## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, stomach pain, diarrhea)
- Skin reactions (rash, itching)
- Headache
- Flushing
- Fever
- Arthralgia (joint pain)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)


### **Long-Term Effects**

Not well established.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs are rare, but severe allergic reactions may occur.


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to troxerutin or any of its components
- First trimester of pregnancy (generally avoided)
- Use with caution during breastfeeding (limited data on safety)
- Children under 18 (safety and efficacy not established)


## **Drug Interactions**

- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): May increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects.
- Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin): May increase the risk of bleeding.
- Medications metabolized by the liver: Troxerutin may interfere with liver enzyme activity.
- Cefuroxime, Cephalexin, Cefapirin, Cefazolin, Cefdinir, Cefditoren, Cefepime, Cefixime, Cefprozil, Cefradine, Ceftaroline fosamil, Ceftazidime, Cefmenoxime, Cefmetazole, Cefonicid, Cefoperazone, Ceforanide, Cefotaxime may decrease efficacy of Troxerutin.
- Celecoxib may increase the risk of bleeding.
- Chenodeoxycholic acid may increase the risk of bruising.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy: Troxerutin is generally avoided during the first trimester and used with caution during subsequent trimesters due to limited safety data.

Breastfeeding: Consult a healthcare professional before using troxerutin while breastfeeding, as there is insufficient information on its safety in this population.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

**Mechanism of Action:** Vasoprotective agent, improves capillary integrity, reduces permeability, decreases blood viscosity, and acts as an antioxidant.

**Side Effects:** Common: GI disturbances, skin reactions, headache, flushing. Rare but serious: Allergic reactions.

**Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, first trimester of pregnancy, use with caution during breastfeeding, children under 18.

**Drug Interactions:** NSAIDs, anticoagulants, medications metabolized by the liver, certain antibiotics may decrease efficacy or increase risk of adverse effects.

**Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Generally avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy and used with caution thereafter. Consult a doctor before using while breastfeeding.

**Dosage:** Adults: 600-1200 mg daily, divided into multiple doses. Topical: Apply gel 2-3 times daily. Dosage adjustments may be necessary in special cases.

**Monitoring Parameters:** Assess for signs of venous insufficiency, monitor for side effects, and evaluate liver and kidney function if necessary.


## **Popular Combinations**

Combinations with other phlebotonics or anti-inflammatory agents may be used, but clinical evidence supporting these combinations is limited.


## **Precautions**

- Pre-existing medical conditions:  Use with caution in patients with liver or kidney impairment, respiratory disease, heart disease, epilepsy, or low blood pressure.
- Pregnant Women: Avoid during the first trimester, use with caution in subsequent trimesters.
- Breastfeeding Mothers: Consult a doctor before use.
- Children & Elderly: Not recommended for children under 18.  For elderly patients, start with a lower dose and monitor for side effects.
- Lifestyle Considerations: Avoid alcohol as it may exacerbate drowsiness. Caution when driving or operating machinery if drowsiness or vision disturbances occur.
