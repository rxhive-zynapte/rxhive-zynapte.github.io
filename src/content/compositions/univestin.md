## **Usage**

- Univestin is a dietary supplement primarily used to manage joint discomfort, stiffness, and promote joint flexibility and mobility associated with osteoarthritis (OA), particularly of the knee. It may also provide short-term symptomatic relief and support overall joint health in adults.  It can be used to treat pain, stiffness, or discomfort in the joints.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Nutritional supplement.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Univestin inhibits enzymes responsible for inflammation (COX-1, COX-2, and LOX), reducing joint pain and stiffness. It also has antioxidant properties and may regulate gene expression related to cartilage health.

## **Alternate Names**

- Lupivestin
- Macvestin
- Cardivestin
- Ostivestin
- Uniortho

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Univestin's primary effect is to reduce joint pain, stiffness, and improve flexibility and physical function. It achieves this by inhibiting the enzymes cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) and lipoxygenase (LOX), which are involved in the inflammatory process.  It also has antioxidant properties that protect joint cells from damage.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Univestin is administered orally, typically in tablet or capsule form. While the precise pharmacokinetic parameters (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) are not fully elucidated in the provided sources, it is known to be generally well-tolerated. Available information suggests dosages from 250mg to 1100 mg/ day have been administered without significant adverse effects compared to placebo. Elimination pathways are likely hepatic and renal, but this needs further confirmation.
- **Mode of Action:**  Univestin's active components, baicalin (from *Scutellaria baicalensis*) and catechins (from *Acacia catechu*), are flavonoids with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. These flavonoids inhibit the activity of COX-1, COX-2, and LOX enzymes, thereby reducing the production of inflammatory mediators. The antioxidant effect helps neutralize reactive oxygen species (ROS), protecting joint tissues from oxidative damage.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** Univestin primarily acts through enzyme inhibition (COX-1, COX-2, and LOX). Information regarding receptor binding or neurotransmitter modulation is not available in the sources.
- **Elimination pathways:** Specific details about the elimination pathways are not fully described.  However, based on its composition and general characteristics of flavonoids, it is likely metabolized in the liver and excreted through the kidneys.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 250 mg - 500 mg orally once or twice daily.  Dosages up to 1100 mg/day have been studied without significant adverse effects.

#### **Children:**

- Univestin is not recommended for children under 18 years of age due to a lack of safety and efficacy data.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment may not be necessary, but consultation with a physician is recommended.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Limited data suggests dose adjustment may not be needed, but caution is advised, and consultation with a physician is crucial.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Limited data suggests dose adjustment may not be needed, but caution is advised, and consultation with a physician is crucial.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consult a physician if you have any other illnesses, particularly heart disease, before taking Univestin.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage recommendations for specific clinical use cases like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations are not available.

### **Dosage Adjustments**
