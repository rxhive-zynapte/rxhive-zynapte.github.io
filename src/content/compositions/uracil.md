      What is the recommended dosage for Uracil in Tegafur-uracil?**


      **A:** Uracil is not dosed independently but is given as a fixed
      combination with Tegafur.  Tegafur is usually dosed at 300-600mg per day
      or 300 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day, taken in 2-3 divided doses every 8 hours when
      taken with or without calcium folinate.

## **Usage**

Uracil, in combination with Tegafur (as Tegafur-uracil), is primarily used as a chemotherapy treatment for various types of cancer. This includes metastatic colorectal cancer, as well as cancers of the breast, stomach, head and neck, and non-small cell lung cancers.  It is also used as adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery for colorectal, gastric, and breast cancers. Uracil itself is not an antineoplastic agent but a biomodulator that enhances the effects of Tegafur.

- **Pharmacological classification:** Antineoplastic, antimetabolite, pyrimidine analog (for its active metabolite 5-FU)

- **Mechanism of action:** Tegafur is a prodrug that is metabolized into 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), its active form.  5-FU disrupts DNA synthesis, impeding cancer cell growth and replication.  Uracil inhibits the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), which breaks down 5-FU. By slowing 5-FU degradation, Uracil increases 5-FU concentration and its antitumor effect.



## **Alternate Names**

Uracil is generally referred to by its chemical name.  The combination with Tegafur is known as Tegafur-uracil.

- **Brand Names:** UFToral, Fimer, Furil, Tegracil, Teroful, UFT, UFT ET, Ufur, Unitoral (and others).


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  The primary pharmacodynamic effect is through 5-FU, which inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (programmed cell death) in rapidly dividing cancer cells.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Tegafur-uracil is administered orally. Tegafur is rapidly absorbed and converted to 5-FU in the liver. Uracil slows down the breakdown of 5-FU by inhibiting DPD, leading to higher and more sustained 5-FU levels. 5-FU is then further metabolized and excreted primarily through the kidneys.

- **Mode of action:** At a molecular level, 5-FU, the active metabolite of Tegafur, inhibits thymidylate synthase by forming a stable ternary complex with the enzyme and its cofactor. This blocks the formation of thymidine, a crucial building block for DNA. Consequently, DNA synthesis is interrupted, leading to cell death. 5-FU can also incorporate itself into RNA molecules, disrupting RNA processing and function.

- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:**  The primary mechanism is enzyme inhibition (thymidylate synthase inhibition by 5-FU). Uracil inhibits dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD).

- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily renal excretion, with some hepatic metabolism.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

Tegafur-uracil dosing is typically based on body surface area (BSA), calculated from height and weight.

#### **Adults:**

The typical dose is 300-600 mg Tegafur per day (equivalent amount of Tegafur-uracil), taken in 2-3 divided doses every 8 hours, preferably one hour before or after a meal to minimize food interactions. When combined with calcium folinate, the dose of Tegafur is often 300mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day, also given in three divided doses with Calcium Folinate 75mg/day. For cervical cancer, 600mg/day in 2-3 divided doses may be prescribed.


#### **Children:**

The safety and efficacy of Tegafur-Uracil in children and adolescents have not been established. Use is not recommended in pediatric patients.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Caution is advised, starting with lower doses and close monitoring for toxicity due to potential age-related decline in organ function.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustments may be necessary depending on creatinine clearance.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustments are likely required due to the liver's role in metabolizing Tegafur. Close monitoring of liver function tests is crucial.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful consideration and dose adjustments might be necessary in patients with heart conditions, bone marrow suppression, or infections.



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Tegafur-uracil, along with other chemotherapeutic agents, is used in various oncology settings. Dosing is generally consistent with the standard recommendations, potentially adjusted based on individual patient characteristics and combination therapies.  Specific protocols may vary based on the type and stage of cancer.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage modifications are based on patient factors like renal/hepatic function, other medical conditions, and observed adverse effects.  Dose reductions or treatment interruptions might be necessary to manage toxicity.  Genetic testing for DPD deficiency is crucial as these patients are at very high risk of severe toxicity from 5-FU.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, stomatitis (mouth sores), anorexia (loss of appetite), increased risk of infections, bruising or bleeding (due to myelosuppression - bone marrow suppression), anemia, skin rash, changes in skin and nails, alopecia (hair loss).



### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Severe myelosuppression (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), severe diarrhea, hand-foot syndrome (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia), hepatotoxicity (liver damage including fulminant hepatitis - severe and sudden liver failure), severe skin reactions, cardiotoxicity, neurotoxicity.



### **Long-Term Effects:**

Chronic myelosuppression, secondary malignancies (risk increases with long-term exposure to chemotherapy), permanent organ damage (e.g., liver, kidney, heart).


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, severe diarrhea, hypersensitivity reactions, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (severe skin reaction), toxic epidermal necrolysis (severe life-threatening skin reaction).


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to Tegafur, Uracil, or 5-FU.
- Severe bone marrow suppression.
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding.
- DPD deficiency (genetic or acquired).
- Concomitant use with sorivudine.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Anticoagulants (e.g., Warfarin): Increased risk of bleeding.
- Antiepileptics (e.g., Phenytoin): Increased Phenytoin levels.
- Cimetidine: Increased Uracil levels.
- Folic acid: May reduce the efficacy of 5-FU.
- Other myelosuppressive agents: Increased risk of bone marrow suppression.
- Live vaccines: Reduced effectiveness of vaccines due to immunosuppression.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Tegafur-uracil is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding. 5-FU is known to be teratogenic (can cause birth defects) and potentially harmful to the developing fetus.  Uracil can also be transferred to breast milk.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Tegafur is metabolized into 5-FU, inhibiting DNA/RNA synthesis, leading to cancer cell death. Uracil enhances 5-FU's action by inhibiting its breakdown.

- **Side Effects:** Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity.

- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe bone marrow suppression, pregnancy, breastfeeding, DPD deficiency.

- **Drug Interactions:** Anticoagulants, antiepileptics, cimetidine, folic acid.

- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.

- **Dosage:** 300-600 mg/day of Tegafur, divided doses, with or without calcium folinate.

- **Monitoring Parameters:** Complete blood count (CBC) with differential, liver function tests (LFTs), renal function tests.


## **Popular Combinations**

- Tegafur-uracil + Calcium Folinate: Calcium folinate enhances the cytotoxic effect of 5-FU, improving treatment efficacy.



## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Evaluate patients for adequate bone marrow, liver, and kidney function before and during treatment. Monitor for signs of toxicity.

- **Specific Populations:**  Avoid in pregnancy and breastfeeding. Use with caution in the elderly and in patients with organ dysfunction.
