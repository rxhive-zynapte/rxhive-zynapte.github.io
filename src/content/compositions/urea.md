## **Usage**

Urea is prescribed for the management of several medical conditions, primarily those associated with elevated intracranial or intraocular pressure, and as an osmotic diuretic to promote water excretion. It also finds use in the topical treatment of certain skin conditions (e.g., xerosis, ichthyosis, onychomycosis) and as a medical food for managing hyponatremia.

It can be classified as an osmotic diuretic, and in some formulations, a medical food.  

The primary mechanism of action is through osmotic diuresis. It elevates the osmolarity of the blood, creating an osmotic gradient that draws water out of tissues, including the brain and eyes, and promotes its excretion by the kidneys. In hyponatremia management, urea normalizes serum sodium levels by inducing osmotic excretion of free water.

## **Alternate Names**

Carbamide

**Brand Names:** Ure-Na (oral powder), various generic formulations for intravenous and topical use.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Urea exerts its effects primarily by increasing the osmotic pressure of body fluids. In the brain and eye, this action reduces fluid volume and pressure.  As a diuretic, urea increases urine output by raising the osmotic pressure within the renal tubules, impeding water reabsorption.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Oral urea is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
* **Metabolism:** Minimally metabolized.
* **Elimination:** Primarily excreted by the kidneys through glomerular filtration, with some contribution from tubular secretion.

**Mode of Action:** Urea does not bind to specific receptors or inhibit enzymes.  Its therapeutic effect stems solely from its osmotic properties.  It does not directly modulate neurotransmitters.

**Elimination Pathways:** Predominantly renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
* **Osmotic Diuresis/Intracranial Pressure Reduction:** 1 to 1.5 g/kg as a 30% solution in 10% invert sugar or 5-10% dextrose, infused intravenously at a rate not exceeding 4 mL/min. Maximum: 120 g or 1.5 g/kg daily. As an oral diuretic: 20g 2-5 times/day.
* **Hyponatremia (Medical Food):** 15 to 60 g daily, orally.  Mix each 15 g dose with 90 to 120 mL of water or juice.

#### **Children:**
* **Osmotic Diuresis/Intracranial Pressure Reduction:** 0.5-1.5g/kg (children >2 years), 0.1g/kg may be sufficient (children <2 years). Oral diuretic: 0.8 g/kg or 25 g/m<sup>2</sup> in 24 hours, divided into 3 doses daily.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Initiate with lower doses and titrate cautiously, monitoring renal function closely.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Use cautiously and with dosage reductions in renal impairment. Contraindicated in severe renal dysfunction.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use cautiously.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

* **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:** Dose as per the indication (e.g., intracranial pressure management).
* **Emergency Situations:** Dose as per the indication.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Adjust dosage based on renal function, patient's clinical condition, and electrolyte balance.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**
Headache, nausea, vomiting, dehydration.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
Syncope, bradycardia, extravasation leading to skin necrosis, hypernatremia.

### **Long-Term Effects**
None specifically associated with short-term use.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
Extravasation leading to tissue necrosis.

## **Contraindications**

Severe renal impairment, marked dehydration, active intracranial bleeding, liver failure.

## **Drug Interactions**

No significant drug interactions have been reported.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Use cautiously during pregnancy, and only if clearly needed. Its presence in breast milk and potential effects on the neonate are not well established. 

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Osmotic diuresis.
* **Side Effects:** Headache, nausea, vomiting, syncope, hypernatremia.
* **Contraindications:** Severe renal impairment, dehydration, active intracranial bleeding, liver failure.
* **Drug Interactions:** No significant interactions.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use cautiously if clearly needed.
* **Dosage:** Varies depending on the indication; see dosage section.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Serum sodium, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urine output, and vital signs.

## **Popular Combinations**

No commonly used drug combinations specifically for urea administration.

## **Precautions**

Monitor fluid and electrolyte balance closely.  Ensure adequate hydration. Infuse intravenously into large veins to prevent extravasation.
