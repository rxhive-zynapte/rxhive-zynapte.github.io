## **Usage**

Ustekinumab is prescribed for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults and children 6 years and older, psoriatic arthritis in adults, Crohn's disease in adults, and ulcerative colitis in adults.  It is classified as an immunosuppressant, specifically a human monoclonal antibody.  Ustekinumab works by targeting the p40 subunit of interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 cytokines, thereby inhibiting these pro-inflammatory cytokines crucial in the development of these conditions.

## **Alternate Names**

Ustekinumab is marketed under various brand names including Stelara, Pyzchiva, Steqeyma, Uzprovo, and Wezenla. Pyzchiva, Steqeyma, Uzprovo, and Wezenla are biosimilars of Stelara.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ustekinumab binds to the p40 subunit shared by interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23, effectively neutralizing their activity.  This inhibits the inflammatory cascade responsible for the pathogenesis of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Following subcutaneous administration, ustekinumab reaches peak serum concentrations in approximately 8.5 days. It has an absolute bioavailability of 55.2%. Ustekinumab is primarily eliminated through proteolytic catabolism, similar to endogenous IgG antibodies, with negligible renal or hepatic elimination.  

**Mode of Action:** Ustekinumab acts by preventing IL-12 and IL-23 from binding to their cell surface receptors. By blocking these cytokines, ustekinumab inhibits the activation of inflammatory cells, including T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cells, reducing the inflammatory response driving these diseases.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Ustekinumab is primarily eliminated through proteolytic catabolism with negligible renal or hepatic excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Plaque Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis:** For patients weighing 100 kg or less: 45 mg subcutaneously initially and 4 weeks later, followed by 45 mg every 12 weeks. For patients weighing more than 100 kg: 90 mg subcutaneously initially and 4 weeks later, followed by 90 mg every 12 weeks.
* **Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis:** Initial dose is weight-based and administered intravenously. Subsequent doses are 90 mg subcutaneously every 8 weeks, although some patients may require more frequent dosing (every 8 weeks).

#### **Children (6-17 years, Plaque Psoriasis):** 
Weight-based dosing is recommended at the initial dose, 4 weeks later, then every 12 weeks thereafter.
* Less than 60 kg: 0.75 mg/kg subcutaneously.
* 60 kg or more: Adult dosing applies (45 mg subcutaneously).

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustment is typically necessary.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is necessary.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution should be exercised in patients with active infections.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Ustekinumab is not indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. It is a long-term maintenance therapy for the chronic conditions mentioned earlier.



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary based on patient response and tolerance.  If a patient does not respond adequately to the standard dosing regimen, the frequency of administration may be increased.  


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

Nasopharyngitis, headache, fatigue, injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling), upper respiratory tract infections.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Serious infections (bacterial, fungal, viral), including tuberculosis reactivation; allergic reactions (rash, hives, angioedema); malignancies.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

The potential long-term effects of ustekinumab are still being studied. However, some concerns include an increased risk of certain infections and possibly malignancies with prolonged use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Anaphylaxis, severe infections requiring hospitalization.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to ustekinumab.
* Active, clinically important infections, including active tuberculosis.
* Concomitant administration of live vaccines.


## **Drug Interactions**

* Live vaccines:  Avoid concomitant use and for a period before and after ustekinumab treatment (see specific vaccine guidelines).
* Immunosuppressants: Concurrent use can further increase the risk of infection.
* Warfarin and cyclosporine:  Ustekinumab may affect the levels of these medications, necessitating monitoring and potential dose adjustments.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy:** Data on ustekinumab use during pregnancy are limited. It is advised to discuss risks and benefits with the healthcare provider.  Data suggests no increased risk of congenital anomalies or pregnancy complications.
* **Breastfeeding:** Ustekinumab is present in breast milk in very small amounts. Due to its poor oral bioavailability, the risk to the infant is considered low.  However, the decision to breastfeed while taking ustekinumab should be made in consultation with a healthcare provider.




## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibits IL-12 and IL-23 cytokines.
* **Side Effects:** Nasopharyngitis, headache, fatigue, injection site reactions, infections.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, active infections, live vaccines.
* **Drug Interactions:** Live vaccines, immunosuppressants, warfarin, cyclosporine.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Consult with a healthcare provider to weigh risks and benefits. Limited data suggest no increased risk, but caution is advised.
* **Dosage:** Weight-based IV loading dose followed by subcutaneous maintenance therapy every 8 or 12 weeks.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Complete blood counts, liver function tests, signs and symptoms of infection.



## **Popular Combinations**

Ustekinumab can be used with or without concomitant methotrexate for psoriatic arthritis.  In some cases, other immunosuppressants may be added to enhance efficacy, but this increases the risk of infection.


## **Precautions**

* Evaluate for tuberculosis infection before initiating therapy.
* Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection.
* Avoid live vaccines.
* Exercise caution in patients with a history of recurring infections.
