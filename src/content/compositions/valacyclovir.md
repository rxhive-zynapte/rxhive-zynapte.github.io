## **Usage**

Valacyclovir is prescribed for the treatment of infections caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), including herpes labialis (cold sores), genital herpes, herpes zoster (shingles), and chickenpox. It is also used for prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in transplant recipients.  Its pharmacological classification is antiviral. The mechanism of action involves the inhibition of viral DNA polymerase, thus preventing viral replication.


## **Alternate Names**

Valaciclovir is the international nonproprietary name (INN).  Brand names include Valtrex.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics**: Valacyclovir is a prodrug of acyclovir. After oral administration, it is rapidly absorbed and almost completely converted to acyclovir.  Acyclovir is then phosphorylated intracellularly to acyclovir triphosphate, the active form of the drug.  Acyclovir triphosphate competitively inhibits viral DNA polymerase, leading to chain termination and preventing viral DNA replication.  This action is highly selective for virus-infected cells.

**Pharmacokinetics**: Valacyclovir exhibits high oral bioavailability (approximately 54%) compared to acyclovir. Peak plasma concentrations are achieved 1-2 hours post-administration.  Acyclovir is primarily eliminated by renal excretion, both as the unchanged drug and metabolites.  The half-life of acyclovir is approximately 3 hours in patients with normal renal function.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Cold Sores:** 2 grams twice daily for 1 day (two doses 12 hours apart).
* **Genital Herpes (Initial Episode):** 1 gram twice daily for 10 days.
* **Genital Herpes (Recurrent Episodes):** 500 mg twice daily for 3 days or 1 gram once daily for 5 days.
* **Herpes Zoster (Shingles):** 1 gram three times daily for 7 days.
* **Suppression of Genital Herpes:** 500 mg to 1 gram once daily (depending on frequency of recurrence). Alternatively, 500 mg twice daily or 250 mg twice daily if ≥ 10 recurrences/year.
* **CMV Prophylaxis:** 2 grams four times daily. Dose adjustment is necessary for patients with impaired renal function.

#### **Children:**

* **Chickenpox (2-18 years):** 20 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 1 gram per dose) three times a day for 5 days. Dose should be determined by body weight. 
* **Cold Sores (≥12 years):** 2 grams twice daily for 1 day.
* Genital Herpes: Use and dose must be determined by a doctor.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Dose adjustment may be necessary based on renal function.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose reduction is required depending on creatinine clearance (see sources for specific adjustments).
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose adjustment is usually not necessary in mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Limited clinical data are available for severe hepatic impairment.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosing for specific clinical use cases beyond standard indications should be determined based on patient condition, severity of infection, and clinical experience.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS), acute renal failure, hallucinations, confusion.

### **Long-Term Effects**

No documented long-term side effects from recommended dosages.


## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to valacyclovir or acyclovir.


## **Drug Interactions**

Probenecid, cimetidine, other nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides, NSAIDs).



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Limited data are available on valacyclovir use during pregnancy.  Acyclovir is excreted in breast milk.  The decision to use valacyclovir during pregnancy or breastfeeding should be made after careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits.
