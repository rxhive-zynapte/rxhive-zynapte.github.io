      and liver function tests is essential. More frequent monitoring might be
      required in patients with pre-existing cytopenias, renal impairment, or
      those receiving concurrent myelosuppressive medications.

## **Usage**

Valganciclovir is prescribed for the treatment and prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals such as those with AIDS or transplant recipients. It is also used to treat CMV retinitis in AIDS patients.  It is classified as an antiviral agent.

Valganciclovir's mechanism of action involves its conversion to ganciclovir, which inhibits viral DNA polymerase, thus preventing viral replication.

## **Alternate Names**

Valganciclovir is also known as the L-valyl ester of ganciclovir. A popular brand name under which it is marketed is ValcyteÂ®.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Valganciclovir is a prodrug of ganciclovir. After oral administration, it is rapidly absorbed and hydrolyzed to ganciclovir, primarily by intestinal and hepatic esterases.  Ganciclovir is then actively transported into CMV-infected cells. Inside the cells, ganciclovir is phosphorylated to ganciclovir triphosphate, which is the active form of the drug. Ganciclovir triphosphate competes with deoxyguanosine triphosphate for incorporation into viral DNA by viral DNA polymerase. Incorporation of ganciclovir triphosphate into viral DNA results in chain termination and inhibition of viral DNA synthesis.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Valganciclovir has high oral bioavailability, achieving significantly higher plasma concentrations of ganciclovir compared to oral ganciclovir. It is metabolized to ganciclovir, which is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys. The half-life of ganciclovir is prolonged in patients with renal impairment.

**Mode of Action:** Ganciclovir triphosphate inhibits viral DNA polymerase, ultimately leading to chain termination and inhibition of viral DNA replication.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Valganciclovir/ganciclovir's primary mode of action is the inhibition of viral DNA polymerase. It does not have significant receptor binding, enzyme inhibition (other than viral DNA polymerase), or neurotransmitter modulation effects related to its antiviral activity.

**Elimination Pathways:** Ganciclovir, the active form of valganciclovir, is primarily eliminated through renal excretion (approximately 90%). A small portion is eliminated through feces.

## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **CMV Retinitis Induction:** 900 mg twice daily for 21 days with food.
* **CMV Retinitis Maintenance:** 900 mg once daily with food.
* **CMV Prevention in Transplant Patients:** 900 mg once daily with food, starting within 10 days of transplantation and continuing for up to 100-200 days depending on the type of transplant.

#### **Children (Congenital CMV):**

* 16 mg/kg every 12 hours, administered orally with feeds.  Doses are calculated based on body surface area (BSA) and weight. IV ganciclovir is preferred as initial therapy in acute, severe CMV disease.


#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Close monitoring of renal function and dose adjustment as needed.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance is crucial.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Insufficient data; use with caution.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Close monitoring for potential drug interactions and adverse effects.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Valganciclovir dosages in clinical use cases such as intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, and ICU use are typically consistent with the standard dosage recommendations or adjusted based on renal function.  In emergency situations, intravenous ganciclovir is often preferred for faster action.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments are primarily based on creatinine clearance. Specific guidelines should be consulted.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fever, insomnia, abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Seizures, bone marrow suppression (pancytopenia, aplastic anemia), severe neutropenia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, retinal detachment.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

Infertility (male and female), increased risk of malignancy.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

Severe neutropenia, bone marrow suppression, anaphylaxis.



## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to valganciclovir, ganciclovir, or acyclovir. Severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia.


## **Drug Interactions**

Imipenem/cilastatin, zidovudine, probenecid, mycophenolate mofetil, didanosine, other myelosuppressive agents.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Pregnancy Category C. Valganciclovir can cause fetal harm. Effective contraception is mandatory during treatment and for a period after treatment (30 days for women, 90 days for men). Breastfeeding is contraindicated due to the potential for serious adverse effects in nursing infants.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:**  Inhibits viral DNA polymerase.
* **Side Effects:** Neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, severe bone marrow suppression.
* **Drug Interactions:** Zidovudine, probenecid, mycophenolate mofetil.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
* **Dosage:** Refer to detailed dosage section.
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Complete blood counts, renal function, liver function.

## **Popular Combinations**

Often used in combination with other antiviral or immunosuppressive agents in transplant recipients.

## **Precautions**

Close monitoring of blood counts, renal function, and liver function is necessary. Precautions are particularly important in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction, bone marrow suppression, or those receiving myelosuppressive medications. Valganciclovir is mutagenic and teratogenic in animal studies.  Appropriate handling precautions should be followed.
