## **Usage**

Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic prescribed for serious infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, particularly methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA).  It is indicated for conditions such as:  infective endocarditis, septicemia, skin and skin structure infections, bone infections, lower respiratory tract infections, bacterial meningitis, *Clostridium difficile*-associated diarrhea (CDAD), and staphylococcal enterocolitis.  Its pharmacological classification is antibiotic. Vancomycin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to the D-alanyl-D-alanine terminus of peptidoglycan precursors, preventing their incorporation into the cell wall.

## **Alternate Names**

Vancomycin is also known as Vancocin and Firvanq.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Vancomycin exerts its bactericidal action primarily against Gram-positive bacteria by hindering cell wall biosynthesis.  It binds to the D-Ala-D-Ala termini of cell wall precursor units, preventing cross-linking and subsequent cell wall assembly.  This leads to bacterial cell death.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Vancomycin is poorly absorbed orally and is typically administered intravenously (IV) for systemic infections.  For CDAD, it is given orally. After IV administration, it distributes widely into tissues, including the lungs, kidneys, and heart.  Vancomycin is primarily eliminated by renal excretion, with minimal hepatic metabolism.  The half-life is around 4-6 hours in individuals with normal renal function but can be prolonged in patients with renal impairment.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Standard Dose:** 15-20 mg/kg (actual body weight) every 8-12 hours, infused IV over at least 60 minutes for 1g or 120 mins for doses >1g. Loading dose: 25–30 mg/kg (actual body weight, maximum 2.5g). Maximum daily dose generally 2g, but doses up to 4g have been used for severe infections.
*Critically ill adults: 25-30 mg/kg (rounded to the nearest 250mg, Max 2.5g) loading dose is recommended due to correlation between volume of distribution, clearance, and body weight.

#### **Children:**

* **Pediatric Dose:** Initial Dose: 15 mg/kg.
Neonates (<1 week): 10 mg/kg every 12 hours.
Neonates (1-4 weeks): 10 mg/kg every 8 hours.
Infants and Children (≥4 weeks): 10–15 mg/kg/dose (max 750mg/dose) every 6 hours

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Dose adjustment is required based on renal function, which often declines with age.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose reduction and/or increased dosing interval is necessary based on creatinine clearance (CrCl). CrCl <20 mL/min: Initial dose 15mg/kg, monitor levels after 4-5 days, redose only when level <12mg/L.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Although hepatic impairment does not significantly alter vancomycin's pharmacokinetics, caution is advised.

### **Clinical Use Cases:**

* **Intubation/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:**  Loading dose of 25–30 mg/kg is often used, followed by maintenance dosing based on renal function and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).
* **Surgical Procedures (Prophylaxis):** 15 mg/kg IV within 120 minutes before surgery.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dose adjustments are based on renal function, age, body weight (actual, ideal for obese patients), and TDM results (trough levels).


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

* Infusion-related reactions ("red man syndrome"): flushing, rash, pruritus, urticaria, tachycardia, hypotension.
* Nephrotoxicity.
* Ototoxicity.
