## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Vecuronium is primarily used as a skeletal muscle relaxant during surgical procedures and other medical interventions requiring muscle paralysis, such as endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, and in the intensive care unit (ICU).
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Neuromuscular blocking agent, non-depolarizing type.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Vecuronium competitively binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, preventing acetylcholine from binding and thus inhibiting muscle contraction.

## **Alternate Names**

- **International/Regional Variations:** Vecuronium bromide.
- **Brand Names:** Norcuron.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Vecuronium induces skeletal muscle relaxation by competitively antagonizing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. This prevents depolarization of the muscle fiber, leading to paralysis. It has minimal cardiovascular effects and doesn't significantly alter heart rate, blood pressure, or cardiac output.  It also exhibits little histamine release.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Administered intravenously (IV). Intramuscular (IM) administration is not recommended.
    - **Distribution:** Distributes in extracellular fluid and rapidly reaches the neuromuscular junction.  It is 60% to 90% plasma protein-bound. Volume of distribution may be decreased in young children and the elderly.
    - **Metabolism:** Undergoes hepatic metabolism, with the formation of the active metabolite 3-desacetyl-vecuronium, which also contributes to neuromuscular blockade.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted primarily in bile and feces. Some elimination occurs via the kidneys. The active metabolite, 3-desacetyl-vecuronium, is cleared by the kidneys.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Intubation:** 0.08-0.1 mg/kg IV bolus over 60 seconds. If following succinylcholine administration, 0.04-0.06 mg/kg IV bolus.
- **Maintenance:** 0.01-0.015 mg/kg IV every 12-15 minutes as needed, or continuous infusion at 0.8-1.4 mcg/kg/min.

#### **Children:**

- **1-10 years:** 0.1 mg/kg IV, repeated every hour as needed, or continuous infusion 0.05-0.07 mg/kg/hour IV.
- **>7 weeks to <1 year:** Similar to adult dosing, but higher doses and frequent maintenance doses are typically not required.
- **Neonates (up to 4 weeks):** An initial test dose of 10-20 mcg/kg is recommended, followed by incremental doses until the desired level of neuromuscular blockade (90-95% twitch depression) is achieved. The maximum dose in neonates should not exceed 100 mcg/kg.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Same initial and maintenance doses as younger adults can be used, but duration of action may be prolonged due to pharmacokinetic changes.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No specific dose adjustment, but the duration of action may be prolonged, particularly with continuous infusion.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution should be exercised. Prolonged recovery may occur. Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on the degree of impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Vecuronium should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, obesity, neuromuscular diseases (e.g., myasthenia gravis, Eaton-Lambert syndrome), electrolyte imbalances, and acid-base disturbances.

### **Clinical Use Cases:**

- **Intubation:** 0.08-0.1 mg/kg IV.
- **Surgical Procedures:** Initial dose of 0.08-0.1 mg/kg IV, followed by maintenance doses as needed.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Continuous infusion, starting at 0.8-1.4 mcg/kg/min, titrated to response.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:** Continuous infusion, titrated to maintain desired level of paralysis.
- **Emergency Situations:** Vecuronium is not typically used in emergency situations requiring rapid sequence intubation.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dose adjustments may be required for patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, and in those with comorbid conditions, especially those affecting neuromuscular transmission. Neuromuscular monitoring is recommended for all patients receiving vecuronium.
