## **Usage**

Venlafaxine is prescribed for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and panic disorder, including long-term treatment.  It's also used for the prevention of relapse and recurrence of depression.

- **Pharmacological Classification:** Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), antidepressant, anxiolytic.

- **Mechanism of Action:** Venlafaxine inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine in the central nervous system. At lower doses, it primarily acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), while at higher doses, the norepinephrine reuptake inhibition becomes more prominent. This dual action is thought to contribute to its efficacy in treating various mood and anxiety disorders.


## **Alternate Names**

- **International and Regional Variations:**  No significant variations.
- **Brand Names:** Efexor, Efexor XR.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Venlafaxine increases the synaptic concentrations of serotonin and norepinephrine, which are neurotransmitters believed to play a crucial role in mood regulation and anxiety.

- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Well absorbed orally.
    - **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6, to its active metabolite, O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV).
    - **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated renally, with a small fraction excreted in the feces.  The elimination half-life of venlafaxine is approximately 5 hours, while that of ODV is around 11 hours.

- **Mode of Action:** Venlafaxine binds to the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters, inhibiting their reuptake into presynaptic neurons.  This increases the availability of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft, leading to enhanced postsynaptic receptor activation.

- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake.  CYP2D6 is the primary enzyme involved in its metabolism.

- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion; hepatic metabolism via CYP2D6.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder:** Initial dose: 75 mg/day orally, administered once daily with food. The dose may be increased in increments of up to 75 mg/day at intervals of not less than 4 days, based on clinical response, to a maximum of 225 mg/day. For some patients, a lower initial dose of 37.5 mg/day for 4-7 days may be considered.
- **Panic Disorder:** Initial dose: 37.5 mg/day orally for 7 days, then increased to 75 mg/day.  May be further increased in increments of up to 75 mg/day at intervals of not less than 4 days, based on clinical response, to a maximum of 225 mg/day.

#### **Children:**

Use of venlafaxine is not recommended in children under 18 years of age due to safety concerns and lack of sufficient clinical data.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Initiate at the lowest recommended dose and titrate cautiously.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Reduce the total daily dose by 25-50% for mild to moderate impairment (CrCl 30-89 mL/min). Reduce the total daily dose by 50% or more for severe impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min) or hemodialysis.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Reduce the total daily dose by 50% for mild to moderate impairment. Further reductions may be necessary for severe impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments may be required based on individual patient needs and the specific comorbid condition.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Venlafaxine is not typically used in the context of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage adjustments are necessary based on patient-specific factors like renal/hepatic dysfunction, age, and comorbid conditions as detailed above.



## **Side Effects**
