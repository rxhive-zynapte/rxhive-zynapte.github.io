## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Vi Capsular Polysaccharide Of Salmonella Typhi (Typhim Vi) is a vaccine prescribed for the *prevention* of typhoid fever caused by *Salmonella typhi* bacteria.  It is recommended for individuals traveling to typhoid-endemic areas, residents of endemic zones, and those at occupational risk, such as laboratory workers, healthcare providers, and food handlers.

- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Vaccine; specifically, a bacterial polysaccharide vaccine.

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Typhim Vi stimulates an immune response by presenting the purified Vi capsular polysaccharide antigen of *Salmonella typhi* to the immune system.  This triggers the production of antibodies, primarily IgG, which target and neutralize the *Salmonella typhi* bacteria upon subsequent exposure, thus preventing typhoid fever.


## **Alternate Names**

- Typhoid Vi Polysaccharide Vaccine
- ViCPS

- **Brand Names:**  
    - Typhim Vi
    - Typherix (in some regions)
    - Typbar (in some regions)



## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  The vaccine elicits a predominantly IgG antibody response directed against the Vi capsular polysaccharide of *Salmonella typhi*. This immune response confers protection against typhoid fever.

- **Pharmacokinetics:** Typhim Vi is administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously. The Vi polysaccharide is not extensively metabolized.  Antibody titers peak within 2-3 weeks post-vaccination. The duration of protection is estimated to be around 3 years, with antibody levels declining over time. Elimination pathways are not well-characterized, but some polysaccharide fragments may be excreted renally.

- **Mode of Action:** The purified Vi capsular polysaccharide antigen activates B lymphocytes, leading to the production of Vi-specific antibodies. These antibodies opsonize *Salmonella typhi* bacteria, facilitating their phagocytosis and destruction by immune cells.

- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** This vaccine does not operate via receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation. Its primary mechanism is direct stimulation of the humoral immune response.

- **Elimination Pathways:** The elimination pathways for polysaccharide vaccines are not fully defined, with some limited renal excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 0.5 mL as a single intramuscular or subcutaneous injection.
- Booster doses are recommended every 3 years for individuals who remain at risk.

#### **Children (≥ 2 years):**

- 0.5 mL as a single intramuscular or subcutaneous injection.
- Booster doses are recommended every 3 years for individuals who remain at risk.
- Not recommended for children under 2 years of age due to the potential for an inadequate antibody response.



#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Same dosage as adults.

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is specifically indicated.

- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment is specifically indicated.

- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with immunodeficiency or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy, as they may mount a suboptimal response to the vaccine.




### **Clinical Use Cases**

 The vaccine is intended for pre-exposure prophylaxis, not for treatment during acute illness or for carriers of *S. typhi*.  It does not have a role in the clinical scenarios listed (intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, emergency situations).

### **Dosage Adjustments**

 No specific dosage adjustments are indicated based on renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms. However,  caution is warranted in immunocompromised individuals.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

- Local reactions at the injection site: pain, redness, swelling.
- Systemic reactions: headache, myalgia, fatigue, low-grade fever.  These are usually mild and transient.


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Allergic reactions (rare): rash, pruritus, urticaria, anaphylaxis.


### **Long-Term Effects:**  No long-term adverse effects have been documented.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**  Anaphylaxis, though rare, is a serious ADR requiring immediate medical attention.


## **Contraindications**

- History of severe hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine.
- Postpone vaccination in patients with acute febrile illness.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., corticosteroids, chemotherapy, biologic agents) can diminish the immune response to Typhim Vi.
- The vaccine may be administered concomitantly with other vaccines, but at different injection sites.
- No significant interactions are known with commonly prescribed medications, OTC drugs, supplements, or lifestyle factors.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Not routinely recommended during pregnancy; only administer if clearly needed and after careful risk-benefit assessment. 

- **Breastfeeding:**  It is not known if the vaccine is excreted in human milk. Caution advised.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Induces antibody response against *Salmonella typhi* Vi capsular polysaccharide.

- **Side Effects:** Local injection site reactions, headache, fatigue, myalgia. Rarely, allergic reactions.

- **Contraindications:** Severe hypersensitivity to vaccine components, acute febrile illness.

- **Drug Interactions:** Immunosuppressants can reduce vaccine effectiveness.

- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution; assess risk/benefit.

- **Dosage:** 0.5 mL single IM/SC injection; booster every 3 years if at continued risk.

- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for allergic reactions post-vaccination.


## **Popular Combinations**

Typhim Vi can be co-administered with other travel vaccines (e.g., hepatitis A, yellow fever), but at separate injection sites.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Screen for contraindications before administering. Have epinephrine readily available in case of anaphylaxis. Syncope can occur post-vaccination.

- **Specific Populations:** See Pregnancy and Breastfeeding sections.  Not recommended for children <2 years.

- **Lifestyle Considerations:** No specific lifestyle restrictions.
