## **Usage**

Vilanterol is a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA) indicated for the long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. It is also used to reduce exacerbations of COPD in patients with a history of exacerbations.  Vilanterol is also indicated for the maintenance treatment of asthma in certain patients.  It is *not* indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm. It is always used in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) like fluticasone furoate.  Therefore, Vilanterol itself is not prescribed alone but as part of combination inhalers.

## **Alternate Names**

Vilanterol trifenatate is the full chemical name.  It's primarily known by its generic name, vilanterol.  Brand names of combination inhalers containing vilanterol include Breo Ellipta (with fluticasone furoate), Anoro Ellipta (with umeclidinium), and Relvar Ellipta (with fluticasone furoate).

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Vilanterol, a LABA, relaxes the smooth muscle in the airways. This bronchodilation effect results from its binding to beta2-adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle cells, leading to an increase in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased cAMP levels activate protein kinase A, which inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin and lowers intracellular calcium concentrations, causing relaxation of the airway smooth muscle.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
* **Absorption:** Following oral inhalation, vilanterol is systemically absorbed.
* **Metabolism:**  Vilanterol is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoenzyme.
* **Elimination:**  Vilanterol is eliminated through both renal and hepatic pathways.  The effective half-life for accumulation, determined from inhalation administration, is approximately 16 hours in individuals with asthma and about 21 hours in individuals with COPD.


## **Dosage**

Vilanterol is *always* administered in fixed-dose combination with an inhaled corticosteroid. The dosage information below refers to the vilanterol component within these combination inhalers:

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **COPD:**  25 mcg vilanterol (in combination with 100 mcg fluticasone furoate or 62.5 mcg umeclidinium) inhaled once daily.
* **Asthma:** 25 mcg vilanterol (in combination with 50 mcg, 100 mcg or 200 mcg fluticasone furoate), inhaled once daily.

#### **Children:**

* **Asthma (5-11 years):** 25 mcg vilanterol (with 50 mcg fluticasone furoate) inhaled once daily.
* **Asthma (12-17 years):** 25 mcg vilanterol (with 100 mcg fluticasone furoate) inhaled once daily.
* **COPD:** Use is not recommended in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** No dosage adjustment is required.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dosage adjustment is required.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Caution should be exercised due to potential increased risk of systemic effects of the corticosteroid component.  No dosage adjustment of vilanterol itself is required, though the concomitant ICS might require adjustment.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Evaluate patient-specific factors and consider any necessary adjustments in the concomitant ICS dosage.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Vilanterol is *not* indicated for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest. It is strictly for maintenance treatment of COPD and asthma.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

No specific dosage adjustments are required based on age, renal impairment, or hepatic impairment.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Common side effects reported with vilanterol-containing inhalers include: Upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, headache, bronchitis, influenza, sinusitis, back pain, oropharyngeal pain, cough.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Rare but serious side effects can include: Paradoxical bronchospasm, hypersensitivity reactions (including angioedema, urticaria), cardiovascular effects (palpitations, tachycardia).

### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential long-term effects might include:  Decreased bone mineral density, increased risk of pneumonia (in COPD patients), growth suppression in children (with ICS use).


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs necessitating immediate intervention include severe hypersensitivity reactions like angioedema.


## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to vilanterol or any components of the combination inhaler.
* Primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of COPD or asthma where intensive measures are required.


## **Drug Interactions**

* **Beta-blockers:** May antagonize the bronchodilating effects of vilanterol.
* **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** May increase vilanterol exposure and potentially increase the risk of adverse effects.
* **CYP3A4 Inducers:**  May decrease vilanterol exposure.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Vilanterol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. It is not known whether vilanterol is excreted in human milk.  Caution should be exercised when administering to nursing women.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** LABA, binds to beta2-adrenergic receptors, relaxes airway smooth muscle.
* **Side Effects:** Upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, headache, paradoxical bronchospasm, hypersensitivity reactions.
* **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to vilanterol, acute bronchospasm.
* **Drug Interactions:** Beta-blockers, CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.
* **Dosage:**  25 mcg once daily (in combination with an ICS).
* **Monitoring Parameters:**  COPD or asthma symptoms, lung function tests.

## **Popular Combinations**

Vilanterol is commonly combined with:

* **Fluticasone furoate:**  An inhaled corticosteroid that reduces airway inflammation.
* **Umeclidinium:** A long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) that also bronchodilates.

## **Precautions**

* **General Precautions:** Monitor for paradoxical bronchospasm and cardiovascular effects.
* **Specific Populations:**  Use with caution in pregnant/breastfeeding women and in patients with hepatic impairment.
