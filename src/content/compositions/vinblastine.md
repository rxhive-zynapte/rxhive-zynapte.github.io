## **Usage**

Vinblastine is prescribed for the treatment of various cancers, including:

* Hodgkin's disease
* Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (including histiocytic lymphoma and lymphocytic lymphoma)
* Breast cancer
* Methotrexate-resistant choriocarcinoma
* Renal cell carcinoma
* Testicular cancer (including teratoma and seminoma)
* Kaposi's sarcoma
* Mycosis fungoides (advanced stages)
* Langerhans cell histiocytosis (Letterer-Siwe disease)

**Pharmacological Classification:** Vinblastine is classified as an antineoplastic agent, specifically a vinca alkaloid.

**Mechanism of Action:** Vinblastine inhibits microtubule formation by binding to tubulin, thereby disrupting cell division at the metaphase stage. This primarily affects rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells.



## **Alternate Names**

* **Generic Name:** Vinblastine Sulfate
* **Brand Names:** Velban, DBL Vinblastine Injection, VinBLAStine



## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Vinblastine's primary effect is to block cell division by disrupting microtubule polymerization.  This leads to metaphase arrest and ultimately cell death, particularly in rapidly dividing cells.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

* **Absorption:** Vinblastine is administered intravenously, therefore absorption is not a relevant factor.
* **Metabolism:**  Primarily metabolized in the liver by the CYP3A4 enzyme system.
* **Elimination:** Excreted slowly in urine and feces via biliary excretion.  Vinblastine has a long half-life, making breastfeeding generally contraindicated.

**Mode of Action:** Vinblastine binds to tubulin dimers, preventing their assembly into microtubules which are essential for cell division (mitosis). This results in mitotic arrest at metaphase, leading to cell death.

**Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Vinblastine directly targets tubulin, a structural protein, rather than a receptor, enzyme, or neurotransmitter. It does, however, have a potent inhibitory effect on the CYP3A4 enzyme system which may impact the metabolism of co-administered drugs.

**Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily hepatic metabolism followed by biliary excretion into the feces. Some renal excretion also occurs.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

Initial dose: 3.7 mg/m² intravenously once weekly.  Subsequent doses may be increased incrementally by 1.8 mg/m² weekly, based on the patient's white blood cell count, with a maximum dose of 18.5 mg/m² weekly.  Most adult patients receive a dose between 5.5 to 7.4 mg/m² weekly.

#### **Children:**

Initial dose: 2.5 mg/m² intravenously once weekly.  Dosage may be incrementally increased by approximately 1.25 mg/m² weekly, based on tolerance and white blood cell count, not to exceed 12.5 mg/m² weekly.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:**  Use with caution due to potential for increased toxicity.  Close monitoring is recommended.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is typically necessary.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage reduction may be required depending on the degree of impairment. For bilirubin >1 to 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), use 50% of the usual dose. For bilirubin >2.5 times ULN, use 25% of the usual dose.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution should be used in patients with pre-existing bone marrow suppression, infections, or ischemic heart disease.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Vinblastine's dosage is determined based on the specific cancer being treated, typically as part of a combination chemotherapy regimen.  Specific dosages for use in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations are not relevant as its usage is primarily within oncology protocols.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications may be required based on hematologic toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) or other adverse effects.



## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

* Nausea and vomiting
* Constipation
* Hair loss (alopecia)
* Fatigue
* Loss of appetite
* Headache
* Jaw pain
* Peripheral neuropathy (numbness or tingling in hands and feet)

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

* Myelosuppression (decreased production of blood cells leading to anemia, increased risk of infection, and bleeding)
* Severe allergic reactions
* Neurotoxicity (including autonomic neuropathy, cranial nerve palsies)
* Pulmonary toxicity
* Ileus

### **Long-Term Effects**

* Secondary malignancies (e.g., leukemia)
* Infertility

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

* Severe hypersensitivity reactions
* Febrile neutropenia
* Extravasation injury (tissue damage at the injection site)



## **Contraindications**

* Hypersensitivity to vinblastine
* Severe myelosuppression
* Active bacterial infections
* Pregnancy
* Intrathecal administration


## **Drug Interactions**

Vinblastine is metabolized by CYP3A4 and can interact with drugs that inhibit or induce this enzyme, leading to either increased toxicity (inhibitors) or reduced efficacy (inducers).  Examples include:

* CYP3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, ritonavir)
* CYP3A4 inducers (carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin)

Other significant interactions include those with:

* Mitomycin (increased risk of bronchospasm)
* Phenytoin (decreased phenytoin levels)
* Myelosuppressive agents (additive bone marrow suppression)


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

* **Pregnancy Safety Category:** D (FDA) – positive evidence of human fetal risk, but potential benefits may warrant use in pregnant women despite potential risks.
* **Fetal Risks:** Vinblastine is teratogenic and can cause birth defects.
* **Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in infants and vinblastine's long half-life.
