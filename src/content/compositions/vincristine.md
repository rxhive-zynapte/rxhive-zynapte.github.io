## **Usage**

Vincristine, a vinca alkaloid, is primarily used to treat various types of cancer, including:

*   Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
*   Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
*   Hodgkin's lymphoma
*   Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
*   Rhabdomyosarcoma
*   Neuroblastoma
*   Wilms' tumor

Its pharmacological classification is antineoplastic/antimicrotubule agent.

Vincristine works by inhibiting microtubule formation within cells. Microtubules are crucial for cell division (mitosis). By disrupting microtubule function, vincristine prevents cancer cells from dividing and growing, ultimately leading to cell death.

## **Alternate Names**

*   Vincristine sulfate

Brand names:

*   Oncovin®
*   Vincasar PFS®

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Vincristine binds to tubulin dimers, preventing their polymerization into microtubules. This disrupts the mitotic spindle apparatus, arresting cells in metaphase and ultimately causing cell death. Its primary effect is on rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Vincristine is poorly absorbed orally and is therefore administered intravenously.
*   **Distribution:** It has a large volume of distribution, indicating widespread tissue penetration.  It does not cross the blood-brain barrier effectively.
*   **Metabolism:** Primarily hepatic, though the exact metabolic pathways aren't fully elucidated. CYP3A4 enzymes may be involved to some extent.
*   **Elimination:** Primarily biliary excretion through feces, with some renal elimination. The terminal half-life is highly variable (15-155 hours).

**Mode of Action:** Vincristine binds to tubulin, a protein that forms microtubules. This binding inhibits microtubule polymerization, leading to disruption of the mitotic spindle and cell cycle arrest in metaphase. The disrupted microtubules also affect other cellular processes, including intracellular transport and cell shape maintenance.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** The primary mechanism is tubulin binding and inhibition of microtubule formation.  There is no significant interaction with receptors, specific enzymes, or neurotransmitters.

**Elimination Pathways:** Vincristine is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily via bile into feces.  A smaller portion is eliminated unchanged in the urine.



## **Dosage**

Vincristine is administered intravenously.  It is crucial to avoid extravasation, as it can cause severe local tissue damage.

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** 1.4 mg/m²  IV weekly, not to exceed a maximum weekly dose of 2 mg.

#### **Children:**

*   &lt;1 year or ≤10 kg:  0.05 mg/kg IV weekly.
*   &gt;1 year or &gt;10 kg: 1.4 to 2 mg/m² IV weekly, not to exceed a maximum weekly dose of 2 mg.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Maximum single dose limited to 2 mg, irrespective of body surface area, due to increased risk of neurotoxicity.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is typically necessary.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**
    *   Bilirubin &gt;3 mg/dL: Reduce dose by 50%.
    *   More severe hepatic impairment: Further dose reduction may be necessary.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution and consider dose adjustments based on individual patient conditions, especially in patients with pre-existing neuropathy or taking neurotoxic medications.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Vincristine dosage in clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations is generally guided by the standard dosage recommendations and adjusted based on the patient's specific circumstances and comorbidities. No specific dosage adjustments are routinely made for these clinical scenarios.  However, the drug's potential for neurotoxicity, myelosuppression, and other adverse effects warrants close monitoring and potential dose adjustment.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are necessary based on bilirubin levels, neurotoxicity, and other adverse effects.  For severe or persistent side effects, vincristine may be temporarily or permanently discontinued.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

*   Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling, pain in hands and feet)
*   Constipation
*   Alopecia (hair loss)
*   Myelosuppression (decreased blood cell counts)
*   Nausea and vomiting
*   Abdominal pain
*   Jaw pain
*   Bone and muscle pain
*   Swelling in the lower legs
*   Muscle weakness

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

*   Paralytic ileus (intestinal blockage)
*   Autonomic neuropathy (affecting involuntary bodily functions)
*   Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)
*   Severe hypersensitivity reactions

### **Long-Term Effects**

*   Peripheral neuropathy may persist even after treatment discontinuation.
*   Secondary malignancies are a rare but potential long-term risk with chemotherapy.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

*   Severe neurotoxicity requiring discontinuation of the drug.
*   Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction).
*   Extravasation injury (tissue damage from drug leaking outside the vein).


## **Contraindications**

*   Demyelinating form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome
*   Hypersensitivity to vincristine or other vinca alkaloids
*   Intrathecal administration

## **Drug Interactions**

Vincristine interacts with numerous medications. Consult a comprehensive drug interaction resource for a full list, but notable interactions include:

*   CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., azole antifungals, some macrolide antibiotics) can increase vincristine levels.
*   CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, St. John's wort) can decrease vincristine levels.
*   Drugs that can cause nerve damage can increase the risk of peripheral neuropathy.
*   Mitomycin C can increase the risk of bronchospasm.
*   Asparaginase can increase neurotoxicity.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

*   Pregnancy Safety Category: D (US FDA)
*   Vincristine is contraindicated during pregnancy due to potential teratogenic effects.
*   Breastfeeding is contraindicated due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant.
