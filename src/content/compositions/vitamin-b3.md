## **Usage**

Vitamin B3, also known as niacin or nicotinic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin crucial for cellular energy production.  It's prescribed for preventing and treating pellagra (niacin deficiency), and sometimes for managing dyslipidemia (abnormal blood lipid levels). Though not a primary treatment, high doses of niacin can lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides while raising HDL cholesterol. 

**Pharmacological Classification:** Vitamin, Lipid-modifying agent (at high doses).

**Mechanism of Action:** Niacin is a precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), coenzymes essential for various metabolic processes, including energy production, DNA repair, and cell signaling.  At high doses, niacin's mechanism for lipid modification is not fully understood but involves inhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissue, reducing hepatic VLDL synthesis and secretion.

## **Alternate Names**

Niacin, Nicotinic acid, Nicotinamide, Vitamin PP.

**Brand Names:**  Niacor, Niaspan, Slo-Niacin, B3-500-Gr, B-3-50, and other formulations.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Niacin influences energy metabolism, DNA repair, and cellular signaling as a precursor for NAD and NADP. High-dose niacin reduces triglyceride and LDL cholesterol levels and raises HDL cholesterol, possibly by inhibiting lipolysis and hepatic VLDL production.

**Pharmacokinetics:** Niacin is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.  It is metabolized in the liver and excreted primarily in the urine.

**Mode of Action:** Niacin is converted into NAD and NADP, essential coenzymes for numerous metabolic reactions. High-dose niacin's effect on lipid levels may involve G protein-coupled receptor GPR109A activation, inhibiting adipocyte lipolysis and hormone-sensitive lipase.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion. Hepatic metabolism also contributes to niacin elimination.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Nutritional supplementation:** 14-16 mg/day (RDA) for adults.
* **Dyslipidemia:** Much higher doses, typically 1-3 grams/day, are used under strict medical supervision. Start with a lower dose and titrate upwards based on tolerance and lipid response. Sustained-release formulations are preferred to minimize flushing.

#### **Children:**

* Nutritional supplementation: 2-16 mg/day depending on age and developmental stage.
* Niacin is generally not recommended for dyslipidemia in children.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with lower doses and titrate carefully, monitoring liver function and blood glucose levels.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment may be necessary based on the degree of impairment. Close monitoring of renal function is crucial.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Use with caution and close monitoring of liver function tests. High doses are generally contraindicated.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Caution in patients with diabetes, gout, peptic ulcer disease, or liver disease. Dose adjustments may be required.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Niacin's use in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations is primarily related to its role in nutritional supplementation for patients unable to meet their nutritional needs orally. Specific dosing should be based on individual patient needs and clinical status.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments may be necessary based on various factors, including renal or hepatic dysfunction, comorbid conditions, and response to therapy.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Flushing (warmth, redness, itching), headache, dizziness, nausea, upset stomach.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Liver damage, gastrointestinal bleeding,  gout exacerbation,  severe allergic reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Glucose intolerance, liver dysfunction, macular edema.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe hepatotoxicity, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis (especially with statin co-administration).



## **Contraindications**

Active liver disease, severe peptic ulcer disease, active arterial bleeding, hypersensitivity to niacin.


## **Drug Interactions**

Statins (increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis), alcohol (increased flushing and liver toxicity), antihypertensives (additive hypotensive effect), anticoagulants (increased bleeding risk), tetracycline antibiotics (decreased tetracycline absorption).

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Niacin is essential during pregnancy and breastfeeding for both the mother and fetus/infant.  Recommended daily intake is 18 mg during pregnancy and 17 mg during breastfeeding. High doses are generally not recommended during pregnancy unless specifically prescribed for pellagra. Niacin is present in breast milk.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Precursor to NAD and NADP, essential for metabolic processes.  At high doses, affects lipid metabolism through unclear mechanisms, potentially GPR109A mediated inhibition of lipolysis.
* **Side Effects:** Flushing, headache, dizziness, GI upset; rarely liver damage, GI bleeding.
* **Contraindications:** Active liver disease, peptic ulcer, arterial bleeding, hypersensitivity.
* **Drug Interactions:** Statins, alcohol, antihypertensives, anticoagulants, tetracyclines.
* **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Essential nutrient. Standard doses are considered safe.  High doses generally avoided unless prescribed for deficiency.
* **Dosage:**  14-16 mg/day for adults (nutritional), 1-3 g/day for dyslipidemia (under medical supervision).
* **Monitoring Parameters:** Lipid panel, liver function tests, blood glucose, uric acid.


## **Popular Combinations**

Niacin is sometimes used in combination with other lipid-lowering medications, such as statins or bile acid sequestrants, but the combination with statins requires close monitoring for myopathy.


## **Precautions**

General precautions include screening for pre-existing conditions and close monitoring for adverse effects. Specific precautions apply to patients with liver or kidney disease, diabetes, gout, and pregnant or breastfeeding women. Alcohol should be limited, and patients should be advised about the potential for flushing.
