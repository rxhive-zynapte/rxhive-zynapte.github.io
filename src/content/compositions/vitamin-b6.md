## **Usage**

Vitamin B6, also known as pyridoxine, is prescribed for various medical conditions, including:

*   **Pyridoxine deficiency:** This can arise from inadequate dietary intake, malabsorption syndromes, or certain medications.
*   **Sideroblastic anemia:**  A specific type of anemia characterized by the inability to utilize iron properly for hemoglobin synthesis.
*   **Pyridoxine-dependent seizures:** A rare genetic disorder where infants experience seizures that respond to pyridoxine administration.
*   **Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy:**  It's considered a first-line treatment for morning sickness.
*   **Peripheral neuropathy:** It can prevent and treat peripheral neuropathy induced by isoniazid (used in tuberculosis treatment).

**Pharmacological Classification:** Vitamin, water-soluble B-complex vitamin.

**Mechanism of Action:** Pyridoxine is a precursor to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), the active form of vitamin B6. PLP is a crucial cofactor for numerous enzymatic reactions, including those involved in amino acid metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis (serotonin, dopamine, GABA), heme synthesis, and glycogenolysis.

## **Alternate Names**

*   Pyridoxine hydrochloride
*   Pyridoxal
*   Pyridoxamine
*   Nestrex (brand name)

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Pyridoxine exerts its effects through its active form, PLP, which acts as a cofactor for over 100 enzymes, primarily those involved in amino acid metabolism.  It plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter synthesis, heme synthesis, and glycogen breakdown.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:**  Pyridoxine is readily absorbed in the jejunum and ileum via passive diffusion.
*   **Metabolism:**  It's converted to PLP in the liver.
*   **Elimination:** Primarily renal excretion as 4-pyridoxic acid.

**Mode of Action:** PLP acts as a coenzyme by binding to specific enzymes and facilitating their catalytic activity.

**Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** PLP doesn't directly bind to receptors. It modulates neurotransmitter levels by acting as a cofactor in their synthesis. It doesn't typically inhibit enzymes but facilitates their actions.

**Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion; small amounts are also excreted in bile.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   RDA: 1.3 mg/day (19-50 years); 1.7 mg/day (males >50 years); 1.5 mg/day (females >50 years)
*   Pregnancy: 1.9 mg/day
*   Lactation: 2 mg/day
*   For deficiency: 10-100 mg IV/IM initially, followed by 2.5-10 mg/day orally.
*   Nausea in pregnancy: 10-25 mg orally every 8 hours, not exceeding 200 mg/day.

#### **Children:**

*   0-6 months: 0.1 mg/day
*   7-12 months: 0.3 mg/day
*   1-3 years: 0.5 mg/day
*   4-8 years: 0.6 mg/day
*   9-13 years: 1 mg/day
*   14-18 years: 1.3 mg/day (boys), 1.2 mg/day (girls)



#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** No specific dose adjustments, though adherence to RDA is important.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dose adjustments are recommended.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments are recommended.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Consider individual needs based on the specific comorbidity (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease).



### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosages in specific medical settings: there is no standardized dosage protocol for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations regarding Vitamin B6 supplementation. Supplementation should be based on individual patient needs and overseen by a physician.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

Dose adjustments should be considered in cases of severe deficiency, peripheral neuropathy, or specific B6-responsive conditions.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:** Generally well-tolerated at recommended doses. High doses may cause nausea, headache, paresthesia, somnolence, and decreased serum folate concentrations.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**  Sensory neuropathy (at very high doses > 500 mg/day).

### **Long-Term Effects:**  Chronic high doses can lead to irreversible neurological damage.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** Hypersensitivity reactions are rare.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to pyridoxine.

## **Drug Interactions**

*   **Levodopa:** Pyridoxine can reduce the effectiveness of levodopa.
*   **Phenytoin and other anticonvulsants:**  Can decrease anticonvulsant levels.
*   **Isoniazid:** Isoniazid can induce B6 deficiency.
*   **Altretamine:** Can decrease the effectiveness of altretamine, a chemotherapy drug.
*   **Oral contraceptives:** Can increase pyridoxine needs.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

*   Pregnancy Safety Category: A (when used within the RDA). Higher doses may be considered for morning sickness under medical supervision.
*   Breastfeeding: Safe at recommended doses. High doses are not recommended. Excreted in breast milk, dose dependent manner.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** Cofactor for numerous enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and other crucial metabolic processes.
*   **Side Effects:** Generally well-tolerated at recommended doses. High doses can cause nausea, headache, paresthesia, and sensory neuropathy.
*   **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to pyridoxine.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Levodopa, phenytoin, isoniazid, altretamine, oral contraceptives.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Safe at RDA.  Higher doses during pregnancy only under medical supervision.
*   **Dosage:**  See detailed section above.
*   **Monitoring Parameters:**  Monitor for signs of sensory neuropathy with high doses.

## **Popular Combinations**

Often combined with other B vitamins in B-complex formulations.


## **Precautions**

*   **General Precautions:** Assess dietary intake and rule out other causes of symptoms before prescribing.
*   **Specific Populations:** Monitor pregnant women receiving high doses for morning sickness. Ensure adequate intake in lactating women.
