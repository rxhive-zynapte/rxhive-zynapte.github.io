## **Usage**

Vonoprazan is prescribed for the treatment of:

*   Erosive esophagitis (damage to the esophagus caused by stomach acid)
*   Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
*   Gastric ulcer
*   Duodenal ulcer
*   *Helicobacter pylori* infection (in combination with antibiotics)
*   Prevention of recurrence of gastric or duodenal ulcer during NSAID (including low-dose aspirin) administration.

It is classified as a **potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB)**.  Vonoprazan works by blocking the  H+, K+-ATPase enzyme system (proton pump) in the stomach, thereby reducing gastric acid production.

## **Alternate Names**

Vonoprazan fumarate is the chemical name. It is marketed under various brand names including **Voquezna, Takecab, Vonoprazan Fumarate, Vonozan and Vonospire.**

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Vonoprazan competitively inhibits the binding of potassium ions to the H+, K+-ATPase enzyme on the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This action blocks the final step of acid secretion, effectively reducing both basal and stimulated gastric acid production. Unlike proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), vonoprazan doesn't require acid activation and exhibits a rapid onset of action. This leads to faster and more sustained acid suppression.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:** Well-absorbed orally.
*   **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6 enzymes in the liver.
*   **Elimination:** Excreted through both renal and hepatic pathways (urine and bile). Steady state is reached by day 3 of administration.

**Mode of Action:** Vonoprazan is a potassium-competitive acid blocker. This means it binds directly to the potassium-binding site of the H+,K+-ATPase, inhibiting the enzyme's ability to transport protons into the stomach lumen and thus reducing acid secretion. This binding is reversible, non-covalent and doesn't require acid activation.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   **Erosive Esophagitis:** 20 mg once daily for up to 8 weeks for healing; 10 mg once daily for up to 6 months for maintenance.
*   **GERD (Non-Erosive):** 10 mg once daily for up to 4 weeks.
*   **Gastric Ulcer:** 20 mg once daily for 8 weeks.
*   **Duodenal Ulcer:** 20 mg once daily for 6 weeks.
*   ***H. pylori* Eradication:** 20 mg twice daily for 7 days, combined with amoxicillin (with or without clarithromycin or metronidazole).
*   **NSAID-induced Ulcer Prevention (including low-dose aspirin):** 10 mg once daily.

#### **Children:**

Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** Administer with caution due to potential age-related decline in hepatic and renal function.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction to 10 mg once daily for severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min) when treating erosive esophagitis. Not recommended for *H. pylori* treatment if eGFR < 30 mL/min.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction to 10 mg once daily is recommended in moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C) when treating erosive esophagitis. Not recommended for *H. pylori* treatment if Child-Pugh B or C.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with a history of osteoporosis.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Dosage guidelines provided above generally apply to the listed clinical settings, including intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations. Dose adjustments may be necessary based on specific patient circumstances and concomitant medications.

## **Drug Interactions**

Vonoprazan is metabolized by CYP enzymes and can interact with numerous medications:

*   **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** (e.g., clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole) can increase vonoprazan levels.
*   **CYP3A4 Inducers:** (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, St. John's wort) can decrease vonoprazan levels.
*   **Other:** Metoclopramide may enhance vonoprazan absorption.

Consult a comprehensive drug interaction resource for detailed information.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

*   **Pregnancy:** No adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Use only if potential benefit outweighs risk.
*   **Breastfeeding:** Not recommended. Advise patients to discontinue breastfeeding or pump and discard milk during treatment and for 2 days after the final dose.
