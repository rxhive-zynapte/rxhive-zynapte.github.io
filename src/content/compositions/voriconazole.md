## Usage

Voriconazole is a broad-spectrum triazole antifungal agent primarily used for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis, candidemia in non-neutropenic patients, esophageal candidiasis, and serious fungal infections caused by *Scedosporium apiospermum* and *Fusarium* species in patients intolerant of or refractory to other therapies. It is also used as prophylaxis against fungal infections in high-risk patients such as hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients.

* **Pharmacological Classification:** Triazole antifungal agent.

* **Mechanism of Action:** Voriconazole inhibits the fungal cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase, which is essential for ergosterol biosynthesis. Ergosterol is a crucial component of the fungal cell membrane, and its depletion results in fungal cell death.



## Alternate Names

Voriconazole is the generic name. Brand names include Vfend.



## How It Works

* **Pharmacodynamics:** Voriconazole's primary effect is fungistatic or fungicidal, depending on the fungal species and concentration. It disrupts fungal cell membrane integrity by inhibiting ergosterol synthesis.

* **Pharmacokinetics:**

    * **Absorption:** Oral bioavailability is high (approximately 96%). Food can delay but not significantly reduce absorption.  Absorption is saturable, leading to non-linear pharmacokinetics.
    * **Distribution:**  Voriconazole is widely distributed, including into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), reaching therapeutic concentrations.
    * **Metabolism:**  Primarily metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, mainly CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9, with significant genetic polymorphism influencing metabolism (especially CYP2C19).
    * **Elimination:** Primarily eliminated via hepatic metabolism with minimal renal excretion.


* **Mode of Action:** Voriconazole specifically targets the fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase. This enzyme is crucial for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cell membrane. By inhibiting this enzyme, voriconazole disrupts ergosterol biosynthesis, leading to fungal cell death.

* **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** The primary mechanism of action is the inhibition of the fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase. There is no significant receptor binding or neurotransmitter modulation.

* **Elimination pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism, with minimal renal excretion (less than 2% unchanged drug).



## Dosage


### Standard Dosage

#### Adults:

* **IV:** Loading dose: 6 mg/kg every 12 hours for the first 24 hours. Maintenance dose: 4 mg/kg every 12 hours.  Patients less than 40 kg: 3 mg/kg every 12 hours.
* **Oral:** Loading dose: 400 mg every 12 hours for the first 24 hours. Maintenance dose: 200 mg every 12 hours. Patients less than 40 kg: 100-150 mg every 12 hours.



#### Children:

* **2 to <12 years:** IV: Loading dose: Not recommended. Maintenance dose: 7 mg/kg twice daily. Oral: 200mg twice daily.
* **12 to 14 years (<50 kg):**  Follow pediatric dosing based on weight.
* **12 to 14 years (≥50 kg) and ≥15 years:** Follow adult dosing.
* **<2 years:** Use is not recommended.


#### Special Cases:

* **Elderly Patients:** No dose adjustment is typically necessary but consider lower doses in frail elderly.
* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment needed. Prefer oral administration in moderate-severe renal insufficiency.
* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Reduce maintenance dose by 50% in mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Use with caution in severe hepatic impairment only if benefit outweighs risk.
* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor closely for adverse effects and drug interactions. Adjust dose based on drug interaction potential and patient tolerance.



### Clinical Use Cases

The dosing in clinical use cases generally follows the standard dosage recommendations with potential adjustments based on patient-specific factors and clinical response. Monitor voriconazole levels to ensure therapeutic concentrations are achieved while minimizing toxicity.

* **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations:** Standard dosages are recommended initially, with careful monitoring and adjustments based on patient response, organ function, and concomitant medications.



### Dosage Adjustments

Dosage adjustments are crucial due to voriconazole's non-linear pharmacokinetics and susceptibility to drug interactions. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is recommended.

* **Renal/Hepatic Dysfunction:** Adjust dosage as described above.
* **Metabolic Disorders:** Monitor for potential drug interactions.
* **Genetic Polymorphisms:** CYP2C19 genotype significantly influences metabolism. Consider lower doses in poor metabolizers and higher doses in ultra-rapid metabolizers.




## Side Effects
