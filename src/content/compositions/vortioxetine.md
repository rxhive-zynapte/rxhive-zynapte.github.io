      discontinue treatment without consulting their doctor, especially if they
      are on higher doses.  They should also be encouraged to discuss any

## **Usage**

- **Medical Conditions:** Vortioxetine is prescribed for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in adults.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  An antidepressant. More specifically, it's a serotonin modulator and stimulator (SMS).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Vortioxetine has a multimodal action on serotonergic targets, including serotonin transporter inhibition, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor agonism, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptor partial agonism,  5-HT<sub>3</sub>, 5-HT<sub>7</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptor antagonism. This complex interaction is thought to enhance serotonergic neurotransmission in various brain regions relevant to mood regulation.

## **Alternate Names**

-  No widely used alternate generic names exist.
- **Brand Names:** Brintellix, Trintellix.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Vortioxetine enhances serotonergic activity through its multimodal mechanism, which affects several serotonin receptors and the serotonin transporter. This leads to increased serotonin levels in the synaptic cleft, improving mood and other symptoms associated with depression.  It also affects noradrenergic, dopaminergic, histaminergic, cholinergic, and GABAergic systems.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Well-absorbed orally, with an absolute bioavailability of about 75%. Food does not significantly affect absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by CYP2D6.  Other CYP enzymes involved include CYP3A4/5, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6. The major metabolite is inactive.
    - **Elimination:**  Elimination half-life is approximately 66 hours, reaching steady-state plasma concentration in about 2 weeks. Excreted primarily in the urine (2/3) as inactive metabolites, with about 1/3 eliminated in the feces. Only negligible amounts of unchanged vortioxetine are excreted in the feces.

- **Mode of Action:**  Vortioxetine binds to and modulates the activity of multiple serotonin receptors and inhibits the serotonin transporter (SERT).  This leads to complex effects on serotonin neurotransmission, distinct from selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**
    - SERT inhibition.
    - 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor agonism.
    - 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptor partial agonism.
    - 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, 5-HT<sub>7</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptor antagonism.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily hepatic metabolism via multiple CYP enzymes, followed by renal excretion of inactive metabolites.


## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: 10 mg orally once daily.
- Maintenance dose:  Increase to 20 mg/day as tolerated.  If 20 mg/day is not tolerated, consider decreasing the dose to 5 mg/day.
- Dosing frequency: Once daily.
- Maximum dose: 20 mg/day (10 mg/day for CYP2D6 poor metabolizers).

#### **Children:**

- Not indicated for use in patients under 18 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients (≥65 years):**  Initial dose: 5 mg orally once daily.  Increase to 10 mg/day with caution, as tolerated.  Limited data exists for doses exceeding 10 mg/day in this population.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment is necessary. However, caution is advised in patients with severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No dose adjustment is generally recommended for mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Caution is advised in moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Vortioxetine has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and is not recommended in these patients.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be needed in patients with certain comorbid conditions.  For example, patients with a history of seizures or unstable epilepsy should be monitored closely.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Vortioxetine is not indicated for use in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its sole indication is for the treatment of MDD.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- **CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizers:** Maximum recommended dose is 10 mg/day.
- **CYP2D6 Inhibitors (e.g., bupropion, fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine):** Reduce vortioxetine dose by half. Increase back to the original dose when the inhibitor is discontinued.
- **CYP Inducers (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin):**  Consider increasing the vortioxetine dose (maximum 3 times the original dose). Reduce back to the original dose when the inducer is discontinued.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**
Nausea, constipation, vomiting,  dizziness, dry mouth, sexual dysfunction, abnormal dreams.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
Serotonin syndrome,  hyponatremia, bleeding abnormalities (especially when combined with NSAIDs, aspirin, or other anticoagulants), mania/hypomania, suicidal thoughts or behavior (especially in young adults), angle-closure glaucoma, seizures.


### **Long-Term Effects:**
Potential for sexual dysfunction and other chronic side effects with prolonged use. 


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

## **Popular Combinations**

While vortioxetine is often used as monotherapy, it may be combined with other medications (e.g., other antidepressants, anxiolytics, mood stabilizers) in certain cases under careful monitoring by a healthcare professional. Information about "popular combinations" can vary widely based on individual patient needs and clinical practice.  Consulting up-to-date clinical guidelines and expert advice is crucial for appropriate combination therapy.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Evaluate patients for bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania before initiating treatment.
