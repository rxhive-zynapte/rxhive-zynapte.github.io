## **Usage**

Wheat germ oil is primarily used as a dietary supplement due to its rich nutrient content, including vitamin E, other antioxidants, and essential fatty acids. It is sometimes used topically for skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis.  It does not have a formal pharmacological classification like a drug. It is generally considered a nutritional supplement.  Its purported benefits come from the nutritional components which are thought to provide antioxidant protection and support general health.

## **Alternate Names**

Wheat germ oil is also known as *Triticum vulgare* germ oil. There are numerous brand names under which wheat germ oil supplements are sold, varying by region and manufacturer.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Wheat germ oil's effects stem from its rich vitamin E content, particularly the form alpha-tocopherol, a potent antioxidant that protects cells from damage caused by free radicals. It also contains other antioxidants, including vitamin A, vitamin D, and other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) like octacosanol.  The oil's fatty acid profile also includes linoleic acid (omega-6) and alpha-linolenic acid (omega-3) which are important for cell membrane health and have anti-inflammatory properties.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  When taken orally, the oil is absorbed in the digestive system, where the components are incorporated into chylomicrons and transported throughout the body.  Vitamin E is primarily stored in adipose tissue, the liver, and muscles. The metabolism and excretion of the various components follow the normal pathways of lipids and fat-soluble vitamins. There are no specific receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation associated with wheat germ oil.
