## **Usage**

- White mineral oil is primarily used as a lubricant laxative for the treatment of occasional constipation. It can also be used to soften earwax.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Laxative, emollient.
- **Mechanism of action:** White mineral oil works by lubricating the stool and the intestinal lining, making it easier for stool to pass. It slows down the absorption of water from the stool, keeping it softer.  It is not absorbed systemically.

## **Alternate Names**

- Liquid paraffin
- Liquid petrolatum
- Paraffin oil
- White oil

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** White mineral oil acts locally in the gut lumen. It softens stool and facilitates passage through the colon. It has no significant systemic effects when used orally at recommended doses.  Rectal use may stimulate bowel movement.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  White mineral oil is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is eliminated unchanged in the feces.  A tiny amount may be absorbed if aspirated into the lungs.
- **Mode of action:**  Acts as a lubricant within the intestine. Not absorbed into the body.
- **Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation:** None.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily excreted unchanged in the feces.  Inhaled mineral oil can lead to lipid pneumonia.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 15-45 mL orally per day, either as a single dose or divided doses.  Do not use for longer than one week except under a physician's supervision.

- **Children under 2 years:** Not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with the lower end of the dosing range and adjust as needed.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No dose adjustment necessary as it is not systemically absorbed.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No dose adjustment necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with swallowing difficulties due to the risk of aspiration.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- White mineral oil is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its primary use is for the relief of occasional constipation.
