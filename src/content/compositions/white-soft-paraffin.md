## **Usage**

- White Soft Paraffin is primarily prescribed for dry skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, ichthyosis, and xerosis. It is also used to treat or prevent dry, rough, scaling skin, chapped lips, and to protect the skin from harsh chemicals.  It can be used as a protective barrier to prevent skin irritation from urine and feces, especially in infants. In ophthalmology, it is used to lubricate and protect the eye in dry eye conditions. It is also used as an excipient in some pharmaceutical formulations and cosmetics.
- **Pharmacological Classification**: Emolient, skin protectant, lubricant (ophthalmic), laxative (oral).
- **Mechanism of Action**: White Soft Paraffin works by forming an occlusive barrier on the skin's surface, which prevents water loss and helps to retain moisture. This softens the skin, and improves hydration, and reduces itching and irritation. When used in the eye, it lubricates and protects the ocular surface.  When taken orally, it acts as a lubricant laxative, softening the stool and facilitating passage.

## **Alternate Names**

- White Petrolatum
- Soft Paraffin
- Vaseline (brand name)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** White Soft Paraffin creates a hydrophobic barrier that reduces transepidermal water loss, thereby increasing skin hydration and reducing dryness and roughness.  Ophthalmically, it provides lubrication and protection to the ocular surface.  Orally, it lubricates the intestinal tract and softens the stool. 
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Topically, White Soft Paraffin is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation. Orally, a small amount may be absorbed.  It is not metabolized and is primarily eliminated unchanged in the feces. Some may be eliminated through renal excretion following topical administration.
- **Mode of Action:**  Physical barrier formation, preventing water loss. No receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation involved.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Apply to the affected area as needed, typically 2-3 times daily, or as directed by a healthcare professional. For dry eye, apply a small amount to the affected eye(s) as needed, typically at night.
