      Can Zafirlukast be used to treat an acute asthma attack?**


      **A:** No.  It is for long-term control and prevention of asthma symptoms,
      not for acute relief.  Use a short-acting bronchodilator (like albuterol)
      for acute attacks.

## **Usage**

- Zafirlukast is prescribed for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in adults and children aged 5 years and older.  It is also sometimes used to treat allergic rhinitis and exercise-induced asthma.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA).
- **Mechanism of action:** Zafirlukast selectively and competitively blocks the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor CysLT<sub>1</sub>.  Cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC<sub>4</sub>, LTD<sub>4</sub>, LTE<sub>4</sub>) are potent bronchoconstrictors, increase vascular permeability, and promote mucus secretion. By blocking their action, zafirlukast helps prevent asthma symptoms.

## **Alternate Names**

- Accolate (brand name)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Zafirlukast antagonizes the effects of cysteinyl leukotrienes, resulting in bronchodilation, decreased vascular permeability, and reduced mucus secretion.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Rapidly absorbed after oral administration, with peak plasma concentrations (C<sub>max</sub>) reached in about 3 hours. Food reduces bioavailability by approximately 40%.
    - **Distribution:** Highly protein-bound (99%), primarily to albumin. Volume of distribution is about 70 L.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver via CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 enzymes.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted primarily in feces (more than 90%) with less than 10% excreted in urine. Elimination half-life is approximately 10 hours.

- **Mode of action:**  Binds to the CysLT<sub>1</sub> receptor, preventing leukotrienes from binding and initiating their effects.
- **Receptor binding:**  CysLT<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist.
- **Elimination pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism followed by fecal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 20 mg orally twice daily, taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals.

#### **Children:**

- **5-11 years:** 10 mg orally twice daily, taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals.
- **12 years and older:**  20 mg orally twice daily, taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals.
- **Younger than 5 years:** Safety and efficacy not established.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  May have decreased hepatic clearance, but dose adjustment is not routinely recommended. Monitor for side effects.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose adjustment is not necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment, including cirrhosis.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients taking other medications metabolized by CYP enzymes, particularly warfarin.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Zafirlukast is not indicated for:

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations** (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest).  A short-acting beta-agonist should be used for acute asthma attacks.

### **Dosage Adjustments:**

No specific dosage adjustments are routinely recommended for renal impairment or geriatric patients. However, careful monitoring is advised.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Headache
- Infection (particularly upper respiratory tract infections)
- Nausea
- Diarrhea
- Abdominal pain
- Dizziness
- Insomnia

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Hepatotoxicity (e.g., hepatitis, hepatic failure)
- Churg-Strauss syndrome (eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis)
- Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., angioedema, urticaria)
- Neuropsychiatric events (e.g., depression, hallucinations, suicidal ideation)

### **Long-Term Effects**

Chronic complications from prolonged use are rare but may include hepatic dysfunction.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Clinically significant ADRs requiring immediate intervention include severe hepatotoxicity, Churg-Strauss syndrome, and hypersensitivity reactions.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to zafirlukast.
- Hepatic impairment, including cirrhosis.

## **Drug Interactions**

Zafirlukast can interact with several medications, including:

- **Warfarin:** Increased risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of INR is required.
- **Theophylline:** Zafirlukast may increase theophylline levels.
- **Aspirin:** High-dose aspirin may increase zafirlukast plasma concentration.
- **Erythromycin:** Decreases zafirlukast levels and efficacy.
- **CYP3A4 substrates:**  May increase levels of other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., simvastatin, lovastatin).
- **CYP2C9 substrates:** May increase levels of other drugs metabolized by CYP2C9 (e.g., warfarin, tolbutamide).

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** B. Zafirlukast should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Weigh the benefits against potential risks.
- **Breastfeeding:** Zafirlukast is excreted in breast milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking zafirlukast.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  CysLT<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist, preventing bronchoconstriction, mucus secretion, and vascular permeability.
- **Side Effects:** Headache, infection, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness, insomnia; rarely hepatotoxicity, Churg-Strauss syndrome, neuropsychiatric events.
- **Contraindications:**  Hypersensitivity, hepatic impairment.
- **Drug Interactions:** Warfarin, theophylline, aspirin, erythromycin, CYP3A4 substrates, CYP2C9 substrates.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Category B; breastfeeding not recommended.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 20 mg BID; Children 5-11 years: 10 mg BID; 12 years and older: 20 mg BID.  Take on an empty stomach.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Liver function tests (LFTs), INR if co-administered with warfarin, signs and symptoms of hepatic or neuropsychiatric events.

## **Popular Combinations**

Zafirlukast is sometimes used in combination with inhaled corticosteroids for patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma who do not achieve adequate control with inhaled corticosteroids alone.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:**  Monitor LFTs periodically. Assess for neuropsychiatric symptoms.
- **Specific Populations:**  
    - **Pregnant Women:** Use only if clearly needed.
    - **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Not recommended.
    - **Children & Elderly:** Monitor for side effects.
    - **Menstruating Individuals:** No specific precautions.

- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoid alcohol as it may increase risk of liver damage.
