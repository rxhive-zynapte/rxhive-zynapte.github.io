      treats symptoms and does not cure the underlying condition. They should be
      advised to seek medical attention immediately if they experience any

## **Usage**

- Zaltoprofen is prescribed for pain and inflammation associated with conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, low back pain, periarthritis of the shoulder (frozen shoulder), cervicobrachial syndrome (neck-shoulder-arm syndrome), and post-surgical/trauma/tooth extraction pain.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) and analgesic
- **Mechanism of Action:**  Zaltoprofen primarily inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, particularly COX-2.  COX enzymes catalyze the formation of prostaglandins, which are mediators of pain and inflammation. By inhibiting COX, Zaltoprofen reduces prostaglandin production, thereby alleviating pain and inflammation. Zaltoprofen also exhibits some selectivity for COX-2 over COX-1, which may contribute to a lower risk of gastrointestinal side effects compared to non-selective NSAIDs. Additionally, it inhibits bradykinin release, further reducing pain and inflammation.

## **Alternate Names**

- No alternate generic names were found in the provided sources.
- **Brand Names:** Zalto, Zaltokin, Zaltop-80, Zott P (in combination with paracetamol)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Zaltoprofen reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting COX enzymes and bradykinin release.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Well absorbed orally (82%).
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized by CYP2C9 and UGT2B7 in the liver to various metabolites (S-oxide Zaltoprofen (M-2), 10-hydroxy Zaltoprofen (M-3) and S-oxide-10-hydroxy-Zaltoprofen (M-5)).
    - **Elimination:** Primarily via renal excretion (62% as conjugates, 3% as unchanged drug); some hepatic excretion. Biphasic elimination with half-lives of approximately 0.9 hours (alpha phase) and 9 hours (beta phase). The elimination half-life of Zaltoprofen is approximately 2.8 hours after a single dose.
- **Mode of Action:** Inhibits COX enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, thus decreasing pain and inflammation. Also inhibits bradykinin release.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition:** Binds to and inhibits COX enzymes, especially COX-2.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion of metabolites; some hepatic excretion.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 80 mg three times daily. The total daily dose can range from 80 mg to 240 mg, divided into 2-3 doses, adjusted based on patient response and tolerance.

#### **Children:**

- Safety and efficacy in children have not been established, and therefore use is not recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Start with a lower dose and adjust as needed due to potential age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce dose in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Reduce dose and monitor closely.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Caution is advised in patients with underlying health conditions like asthma, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Specific dosage recommendations for clinical scenarios like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, and emergency situations were not found in the provided sources. Dosing should be based on clinical judgment and patient-specific factors.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments may be required based on renal/hepatic function, other medical conditions, and drug interactions.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

- Hepatic dysfunction: Jaundice.
- Renal impairment.
- Hypersensitivity reactions: Rash, itching, angioedema.


### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Chronic use can lead to gastrointestinal complications like ulcers and bleeding, especially in patients with risk factors.
- Renal impairment can occur with long-term use, especially in patients with pre-existing renal disease.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.
- Aspirin-induced asthma or allergic reactions to other NSAIDs.
- Third trimester of pregnancy.

## **Drug Interactions**

- Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin): Increased risk of bleeding.
- Antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin): Increased risk of bleeding.
- Antihypertensives (e.g., ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers): Reduced antihypertensive effect.

- Quinolone antibiotics: Increased risk of seizures.
- Sulfonylurea antidiabetic agents: Increased risk of hypoglycemia.
- Lithium: Increased lithium levels.
- Methotrexate: Increased methotrexate toxicity.
- Other NSAIDs: Increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects.
- Alcohol: Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:** Zaltoprofen should be avoided during pregnancy, particularly the third trimester, due to the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus in the fetus. Use in the first and second trimesters should be limited to cases where the potential benefit to the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus.
- **Breastfeeding:** Limited data suggest Zaltoprofen may be excreted in breast milk; therefore, it should be used with caution during breastfeeding. Consider alternative analgesics if possible.
