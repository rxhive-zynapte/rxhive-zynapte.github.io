## **Usage**

- Zidovudine is primarily used in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection in adults and children. It is also used to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV during pregnancy, labor, and delivery.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NRTI) - Antiretroviral.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Zidovudine inhibits the activity of HIV reverse transcriptase, the enzyme responsible for converting viral RNA into DNA, thus preventing viral replication.

## **Alternate Names**

- Azidothymidine (AZT)
- **Brand Names:** Retrovir

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Zidovudine, after being intracellularly phosphorylated to its active triphosphate form (zidovudine triphosphate), competes with thymidine triphosphate for incorporation into the viral DNA by the HIV reverse transcriptase, which results in premature chain termination and stops viral DNA synthesis. Zidovudine is less active against HIV-2 than HIV-1 due to reduced phosphorylation to the active triphosphate form.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** 
    - **Absorption:** Well-absorbed orally (bioavailability of 60-70%); peak plasma concentration is reached in 0.5 to 1.5 hours.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver via glucuronidation to an inactive metabolite.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted mostly by the kidneys (70-80% as the glucuronide metabolite, 14% unchanged), small amounts also in the bile. Its half-life is around 1 hour.
- **Mode of Action:**  Acts as a nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Intracellularly, it undergoes phosphorylation by cellular enzymes to its active form, zidovudine triphosphate. Zidovudine triphosphate competes with naturally occurring thymidine triphosphate for incorporation into viral DNA by the HIV reverse transcriptase. Its incorporation terminates the viral DNA synthesis.
- **Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:**  Zidovudine competitively inhibits viral reverse transcriptase. No known direct receptor interaction or effect on neurotransmitters.
- **Elimination Pathways:**  Primarily renal excretion (both unchanged drug and glucuronide metabolite). Some hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- HIV treatment: 300 mg twice daily in combination with other antiretrovirals or 250mg twice daily.
- Prevention of maternal-fetal transmission: 100 mg five times a day orally from 14 weeks of gestation until the start of labor, then 300 mg orally every three hours during labor until delivery.
- IV administration (when oral administration is not feasible): 1-2 mg/kg every 4 hours.

#### **Children:**
- Infants ≥ 4 weeks old weighing 4 kg to <9 kg: 12 mg/kg twice daily.
- Infants ≥ 4 weeks old weighing 9 kg to <30 kg: 9 mg/kg twice daily.
- Children weighing ≥30 kg: Same as adult dose.
- Newborn infants (for prevention of mother-to-child transmission): 2 mg/kg every 6 hours starting 12 hours after birth and continuing through 6 weeks of age.


#### **Special Cases:**
- **Elderly Patients:** Pharmacokinetics not extensively studied; dose adjustment may be required based on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction needed in severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 10 ml/min), 100 mg every 6-8 hours. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis do not significantly affect zidovudine elimination.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Zidovudine may accumulate due to decreased glucuronidation; close monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dose adjustments may be required based on specific conditions and concurrent medications.

### **Clinical Use Cases**
- **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations:** IV zidovudine may be used temporarily when oral administration is not possible, using the standard IV dosing.


### **Dosage Adjustments:**
- Hematological adverse reactions (e.g., anemia, neutropenia): Dose reduction or interruption may be necessary.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**
- Headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, myalgia, insomnia.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**
- Lactic acidosis, severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, bone marrow suppression (anemia, neutropenia, pancytopenia), myopathy, myositis.

### **Long-Term Effects**
- Lipodystrophy, lipoatrophy.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
- Anemia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, lactic acidosis, hepatic dysfunction, myopathy.


## **Contraindications**
- Hypersensitivity to zidovudine.
- Patients with markedly low neutrophil counts (<0.75 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L) or severely low hemoglobin levels (<7.5 g/dL).

## **Drug Interactions**

- Other drugs metabolized by glucuronidation (e.g., probenecid, acetaminophen, indomethacin, lorazepam, morphine): May increase zidovudine concentrations.
- Drugs that suppress bone marrow function (e.g., ganciclovir, interferon-alpha, dapsone, flucytosine, vincristine, vinblastine): Increased risk of myelosuppression.
- Nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides, amphotericin B): May potentiate zidovudine-induced nephrotoxicity.
- Ribavirin, stavudine, clarithromycin: May increase risk of anemia.



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**
- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C (FDA).
- **Fetal Risks:**  Generally considered safe when used according to the established guidelines for preventing mother-to-child transmission. No consistent evidence of teratogenicity.
- **Breastfeeding:** Zidovudine is excreted in breast milk. It is generally recommended that HIV-infected mothers do not breastfeed to avoid transmission of the virus to the infant. 


## **Drug Profile Summary**
