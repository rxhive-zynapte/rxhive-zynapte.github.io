## **Usage**

- Zinc bisglycinate is primarily prescribed to prevent or treat zinc deficiency.  Zinc deficiency can manifest as impaired immune function, delayed wound healing, skin lesions, hair loss, loss of appetite, and altered taste or smell.
- **Pharmacological classification:**  Mineral supplement.
- **Mechanism of action:** Zinc is an essential trace element crucial for numerous physiological processes, including immune function, cell growth and division, wound healing, protein synthesis, and DNA synthesis. Zinc bisglycinate provides a bioavailable form of zinc to replenish deficient levels and restore these functions.

## **Alternate Names**

- Zinc chelate, zinc bis-glycinate.
- Brand names vary depending on the manufacturer. Some examples from the sources include *Essentials Zinc 25 mg High Dose - Vegan*, *Care/of Zinc*.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Zinc is involved in hundreds of enzymatic reactions and plays a critical role in cell growth, immune function, wound healing, and protein synthesis.  It acts as a cofactor for numerous enzymes and stabilizes cell membranes.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Zinc bisglycinate is believed to have superior absorption compared to other zinc forms due to the chelation with glycine. This improves its uptake in the gastrointestinal tract. Zinc is primarily absorbed in the small intestine and transported to the liver. It is stored in various tissues, including bone, muscle, and skin. Excess zinc is excreted primarily through the feces, with minor renal excretion.  
- **Mode of action:**  Zinc influences gene expression, protein synthesis, and cell signaling pathways. It also possesses antioxidant properties.
- Receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation specific to zinc bisglycinate are not prominent aspects of its mechanism.
- **Elimination pathways:** Mainly fecal excretion; minor renal excretion.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**
- 15-30 mg of elemental zinc per day.
- The recommended daily allowance (RDA) is 11 mg/day for adult men and 8 mg/day for adult women. These values might vary slightly depending on the guidelines followed (e.g., IOM, IZiNCG).
- Some individuals may require higher doses (up to 40 mg/day) in cases of deficiency, but it is essential not to exceed the tolerable upper intake level of 40 mg/day unless under medical supervision. Higher doses up to 75 mg/day have been suggested in some instances.

#### **Children:**
- Dosage varies depending on age: 2-4 mg for children birth to 3 years; 5 mg for children 4-6 years; 7-9 mg for children 7-10 years; 10 mg for children 4-10 years; 5-10 mg per day. for children birth to 3 years of age. Doses up to 34mg/day have been mentioned for adolescents.
- Safety:  Pediatric dosing should be carefully determined based on age and individual needs.  Avoid exceeding recommended limits.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  May require individualized dosing based on nutritional status and organ function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Dose adjustment might be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  Dose adjustment might be necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consult a healthcare professional to provide recommendations based on each medical condition.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The provided sources do not mention specific dosages for zinc bisglycinate in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations.  Zinc may be included as part of overall nutritional support in these contexts, but specific dosing protocols should be established by the medical team based on individual patient needs and current clinical guidelines.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Renal/hepatic impairment: Monitor renal and hepatic function and adjust dosage if necessary.
- Other conditions: Individualized dosing may be necessary based on factors such as age, underlying medical conditions, other medications, and nutritional status.


## **Side Effects**

- Severe renal insufficiency.
- Acute renal failure.
- Hypersensitivity to flavonoids (for formulations containing flavocoxid/citrated zinc bisglycinate).

## **Drug Interactions**

- **Antibiotics:**  Zinc may reduce the absorption of certain antibiotics, including tetracyclines, quinolones, and some cephalosporins. Timing of administration should be separated by several hours.
- **Penicillamine:**  Zinc can interfere with the absorption of penicillamine, a medication used to treat Wilson's disease and rheumatoid arthritis.
- **Copper:** Zinc can reduce copper absorption.
- **Iron:**  Zinc and iron can compete for absorption, so taking them together may reduce the absorption of both minerals.
- **Amiloride:** May increase zinc levels.
- **Immunosuppressants:** Zinc might counteract the effects of immunosuppressant medications.
- **Deferoxamine:** Can increase zinc excretion.
- **Foods:** Phytates in certain foods can reduce zinc absorption.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Zinc is considered generally safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding when taken within the recommended daily allowances (RDA).
- **Pregnancy:**  The RDA for zinc during pregnancy is 11-13 mg/day.  Higher doses should be avoided unless prescribed by a physician, as high doses may be harmful.
- **Breastfeeding:**  The RDA for zinc during breastfeeding is 12-17 mg/day. Higher doses may be unsafe.
- Formulations containing flavocoxid/citrated zinc bisglycinate are not recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to limited safety data.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Essential trace element involved in numerous enzymatic reactions, supporting cell growth, immune function, wound healing, and protein synthesis.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, stomach cramps, diarrhea, copper deficiency (with prolonged high-dose use).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to zinc, severe renal impairment.
- **Drug Interactions:** Certain antibiotics, penicillamine, copper, iron, immunosuppressants.
