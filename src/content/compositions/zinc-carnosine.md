      How does Zinc Carnosine work to protect the stomach?**


      **A:** Zinc Carnosine adheres to the stomach lining, providing a
      protective barrier against irritants.  It also has antioxidant and
      anti-inflammatory properties, which further aid in healing and protecting
      the gastric mucosa.

      What is the difference between zinc carnosine and regular zinc
      supplements?**


      **A:** Zinc carnosine is a chelated compound of zinc and L-carnosine. This
      specific formulation enhances zinc's delivery to the gastric mucosa and
      promotes its localized effects, making it more effective for
      gastrointestinal health compared to standard zinc supplements.

## **Usage**

- Zinc Carnosine is primarily prescribed for the treatment of gastric ulcers and to promote gastrointestinal health. It may also be used to relieve mild gastric discomforts such as nausea, bloating, stomach upset, and heartburn.  It can also support a healthy gastric microbial balance and protect the gastric mucosa.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  It acts as a mucosal protectant and has some antioxidant properties. It can be considered a nutritional supplement and in some countries is a prescribed medicine.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Zinc Carnosine stabilizes and protects the gastric and intestinal mucosal lining. It exerts antioxidant effects and enhances mucosal defense mechanisms, thereby promoting ulcer healing and reducing inflammation.

## **Alternate Names**

- Polaprezinc
- Beta-alanyl-L-histidinato zinc
- N-(3-aminopropionyl)-L-histidinato zinc
- PepZin GI (brand name)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Zinc Carnosine adheres to the gastric mucosa, providing a protective barrier against damaging factors like stomach acid and *Helicobacter pylori*. Its antioxidant properties help reduce inflammation and promote tissue repair.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**  It is administered orally. Upon ingestion, it slowly dissociates into zinc and L-carnosine in the gastrointestinal tract. Zinc absorption from zinc carnosine is relatively low, with most being excreted in feces. L-carnosine is further metabolized into L-histidine, which is used in protein synthesis. The prolonged presence of Zinc Carnosine in the gut contributes to its therapeutic effect.
- **Mode of Action/Receptor Binding/Enzyme Inhibition/Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Zinc Carnosine doesn't have specific receptor binding or direct enzyme inhibition activity relevant to its gastroprotective effects. However, at the cellular level, its antioxidant action scavenges free radicals, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in the gastric mucosa. The specific molecular details are not fully understood but relate to promoting natural protective mechanisms in the gastrointestinal tract without directly interfering with acid production.  There are reports of interaction with and modulation of some neurotransmitters, but this is not related to its use as a treatment for ulcers.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily fecal excretion for zinc; hepatic metabolism of L-carnosine to L-histidine.
