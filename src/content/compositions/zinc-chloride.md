## **Usage**

- Zinc Chloride is primarily used as a supplement to intravenous solutions given for total parenteral nutrition (TPN).  Its administration helps maintain zinc serum levels and prevent depletion of endogenous stores and subsequent deficiency symptoms in patients receiving TPN. It can also be used to treat and prevent zinc deficiency that manifests as growth deterioration, skin lesions, alopecia, impaired reproductive development and function, and delayed wound healing.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Mineral supplement, trace element.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Zinc is an essential trace element and a cofactor for over 70 enzymes involved in various metabolic processes, including protein synthesis, nucleic acid metabolism, cell growth, and immune function.  Zinc supplementation provides the necessary zinc to maintain these functions in individuals who are unable to obtain it sufficiently through dietary intake, such as those on TPN.

## **Alternate Names**

- ZnCl2
- Zinc(II) chloride

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Zinc is crucial for various physiological functions, including immune response, cell growth and differentiation, wound healing, and enzymatic reactions.  Zinc deficiency can lead to impaired immune function, growth retardation, skin lesions, and delayed wound healing. Supplementation addresses these deficiencies by restoring adequate zinc levels.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Primarily absorbed in the small intestine.  Intravenous administration bypasses intestinal absorption, delivering zinc directly into the bloodstream.
    - **Metabolism:**  Zinc is not metabolized in the traditional sense but is incorporated into metalloenzymes and other zinc-binding proteins.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily excreted in feces, with a small amount excreted in urine.
- **Mode of Action:** Zinc acts as a structural and catalytic component of numerous enzymes and proteins.  It stabilizes protein structure, influences gene expression, and participates in cell signaling pathways.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- 2.5 to 4 mg of elemental zinc per day, intravenously, as an additive to TPN solutions.
- In acute catabolic states: An additional 2 mg of elemental zinc/day.
- With fluid loss from the small bowel: An additional 12.2 mg of zinc per liter of fluid lost, or 17.1 mg per kg of stool or ileostomy output.

#### **Children:**

- Premature infants (up to 3 kg): 300 mcg/kg/day of elemental zinc intravenously.
- Full-term infants and children up to 5 years: 100 mcg/kg/day of elemental zinc intravenously.
- Children over 5 years: Same as adult dose, up to a maximum of 4 mg/day.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Dose adjustments may be necessary based on renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Reduce or omit dose in severe kidney disease due to renal elimination of zinc.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dosage adjustment usually not required.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Monitor for potential drug interactions and adjust accordingly.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Generally well-tolerated when administered intravenously as directed. No common side effects are reported.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Copper deficiency (with long-term use).
- Aluminum toxicity (especially in patients with renal impairment and neonates).

### **Long-Term Effects**

- Copper deficiency may develop with prolonged use, leading to anemia, neutropenia, and other hematological abnormalities.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Copper deficiency can manifest as anemia, neutropenia, and leukopenia.


## **Contraindications**

- Known hypersensitivity to zinc or any component of the formulation.
- Direct intramuscular or intravenous injection (undiluted).

## **Drug Interactions**

- Antibiotics (tetracyclines, quinolones): Reduced antibiotic absorption.
- Penicillamine, trientine: Reduced effectiveness of these chelating agents.
- Iron, calcium supplements: Reduced zinc absorption.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy:**  Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted. Should only be administered if clearly needed.  Data in pregnant women do not suggest an increased risk of fetal abnormalities.
- **Breastfeeding:** Zinc is excreted in breast milk. Potential for zinc-induced copper deficiency in infants.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:**  Cofactor for numerous enzymes, essential for metabolic processes.
- **Side Effects:** Generally well-tolerated; copper deficiency and aluminum toxicity with long-term use.
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity, direct IM/IV injection.
- **Drug Interactions:** Tetracyclines, quinolones, penicillamine, trientine, iron, calcium.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Caution advised; potential benefits may outweigh risks.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 2.5-4 mg/day IV; Children:  Dose adjusted by age/weight.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Serum zinc levels, copper levels (with long-term use), renal function.

## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Monitor serum zinc and copper levels (especially with prolonged use), renal function, and signs of aluminum toxicity.
- **Specific Populations**:
    - **Pregnant Women:** Use only if clearly needed.
    - **Breastfeeding Mothers:** Monitor infant for signs of copper deficiency.
    - **Children & Elderly:** Dose adjustments may be required based on weight and renal function.
    - **Menstruating Individuals:** May experience relief from premenstrual tension and pain (unrelated to zinc deficiency).
