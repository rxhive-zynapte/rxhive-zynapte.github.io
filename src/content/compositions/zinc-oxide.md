## **Usage**

Zinc Oxide is primarily used as a skin protectant. It is prescribed for a variety of dermatological conditions, including diaper rash, minor burns, chafed skin, poison ivy, eczema, and other minor skin irritations.  It also provides protection from sunburn and other skin damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) light. It is classified as a skin protectant, sunscreen, and antiseptic.  The mechanism of action involves forming a protective barrier on the skin, reducing friction and irritation, and promoting healing by keeping the affected area dry. It also reflects and scatters UV radiation.

## **Alternate Names**

There are no official alternate names for Zinc Oxide, but it is marketed under various brand names, such as Desitin, Diaparene, Balmex, and many others. Some products combine Zinc Oxide with other ingredients, such as dimethicone or vitamins.


## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:**  Zinc Oxide acts locally by forming a physical barrier that protects the skin from irritants, moisture, and UV radiation. It has mild astringent, antiseptic, and soothing properties that aid in healing minor skin irritations and wounds.

**Pharmacokinetics:** When applied topically, Zinc Oxide is minimally absorbed into the bloodstream.  The majority of the applied dose remains on the skin surface, where it exerts its protective effects. It is not metabolized systemically. Elimination occurs primarily through removal of the product from the skin surface during washing or shedding of skin cells. It is not eliminated via renal or hepatic pathways. There is no known receptor binding, enzyme inhibition, or neurotransmitter modulation associated with topical Zinc Oxide.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:** Apply a thin layer of Zinc Oxide cream, ointment, or paste to the affected area as needed. For diaper rash, apply with each diaper change, especially at bedtime or when exposure to soiled diapers may be prolonged.  For hemorrhoids, a 10% Zinc Oxide suppository can be used rectally up to six times a day. For sun protection, apply liberally 15-30 minutes before sun exposure and reapply every two hours or after swimming or sweating.


#### **Children:**  The dosage for diaper rash is the same as for adults. Apply liberally with each diaper change, ensuring the affected area is clean and dry.  Use cautiously in infants under six months. For sun protection, apply liberally 15-30 minutes before sun exposure and reapply every two hours, or immediately after swimming or sweating.

#### **Special Cases:** Dose adjustments are generally not necessary for elderly patients, or those with renal or hepatic impairment, as systemic absorption is minimal. However, use with caution in patients with open wounds or broken skin, especially in infants, due to the potential for increased absorption.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The dosages for intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations are not applicable for topical Zinc Oxide.

### **Dosage Adjustments:** Not applicable for topical formulations, as systemic absorption is negligible.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**  Topical Zinc Oxide is generally well-tolerated.  Rarely, mild skin irritation, redness, or itching may occur.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**  Allergic reactions, such as hives, difficulty breathing, or swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat are rare but require immediate medical attention.

### **Long-Term Effects:** No long-term adverse effects have been reported with topical use of Zinc Oxide.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):** Clinically significant ADRs are rare. Allergic reactions are the most serious potential ADR and require prompt medical intervention.

## **Contraindications**

Hypersensitivity to Zinc Oxide is a contraindication. Avoid application to severely broken or infected skin without medical advice.

## **Drug Interactions**

No significant drug interactions are known for topical Zinc Oxide.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Topical Zinc Oxide is considered safe to use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, avoid applying to large areas of broken or damaged skin, especially during pregnancy.
