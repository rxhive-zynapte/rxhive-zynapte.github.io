## **Usage**

- Zinc pyrithione is primarily prescribed for the treatment of dandruff (seborrheic dermatitis) and seborrheic dermatitis affecting the scalp, face, and body. It is also used to treat other fungal skin infections such as athlete's foot, ringworm, eczema, and psoriasis.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Antifungal, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory agent.
- **Mechanism of action:**  Zinc pyrithione inhibits fungal growth by disrupting cell membrane function and interfering with enzyme systems crucial for fungal metabolism and survival. It also possesses some antibacterial properties and can reduce skin inflammation.

## **Alternate Names**

- Pyrithione zinc.
- **Brand names:** Head & Shoulders, Selsun Blue, DHS Zinc, Denorex, Zincon, and others.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Zinc pyrithione exerts its antifungal effect by binding to and disrupting the fungal cell membrane, leading to leakage of essential cellular components and ultimately cell death. Its anti-inflammatory action is thought to be related to inhibition of various inflammatory mediators.
- **Pharmacokinetics:** Primarily topical application. Systemic absorption is minimal when used as directed. Minimal information is available on its metabolism and elimination after topical application. It is believed that any absorbed drug is likely metabolized in the liver and excreted via the kidneys.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Topical application of shampoo, cream, lotion, spray, or soap containing 0.25% to 2% zinc pyrithione, one to three times daily, or as directed by a physician.
- Shampoos: Apply to wet hair and scalp, lather, and rinse thoroughly. May repeat application if needed.
- Creams, lotions, and sprays: Apply a thin layer to the affected area.
- Soaps: Use on affected skin during bathing. Lather, massage into the affected area, rinse, and repeat.

#### **Children:**

- Use and dose must be determined by a doctor, particularly for children under 2 years old. In some cases, a lower concentration (e.g., 0.25%) might be recommended.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** No specific dosage adjustments are typically required. However, start with a lower concentration and increase if necessary, monitoring for skin irritation.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** No specific dosage adjustments are available in current literature. Use with caution and monitor kidney function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  No specific dosage adjustments are available in current literature.  Use with caution and monitor liver function.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Consider the patient's overall health status and any potential drug interactions. Consult a dermatologist or other specialist if needed.

### **Clinical Use Cases**  The information in the sources primarily concerns topical use for dermatological conditions. Therefore, the dosage guidelines outlined above apply to typical clinical use cases. Information regarding specific clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations is not available in provided sources.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose adjustments should be based on individual patient response and tolerance, monitoring for irritation or other adverse effects.  No data are available for specific adjustments based on renal/hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

- Stinging or burning sensation at the application site.
- Skin irritation or redness.
- Skin peeling.
- Itching.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, swelling).
- Severe skin irritation or blistering.
- Hair loss (rare and usually temporary).


### **Long-Term Effects**

No significant long-term effects are expected with topical application, provided it's used as directed.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

The severe skin irritation or allergic reactions mentioned above would be the clinically significant ADRs requiring prompt attention.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to zinc pyrithione.



## **Drug Interactions**

- Limited information is available on specific drug interactions.  However, concomitant use of topical corticosteroids should be avoided or managed carefully.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** Not formally assigned. Animal studies are limited, and human data are lacking. Use with caution during pregnancy only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks.
- **Breastfeeding:** It is unknown whether zinc pyrithione is excreted in breast milk. Use with caution while breastfeeding. Discuss the risks and benefits with a physician.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Disrupts fungal cell membrane function, inhibits fungal growth and exhibits anti-inflammatory properties.
- **Side Effects:** Stinging, burning, skin irritation, peeling, itching (rarely, allergic reactions or hair loss).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to zinc pyrithione.
- **Drug Interactions:** Limited data; avoid concomitant use of topical corticosteroids.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if potential benefits outweigh the risks.
- **Dosage:** Topical application of 0.25% to 2% formulations, one to three times daily.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Observe for skin irritation and treatment response.

## **Popular Combinations**

- Zinc pyrithione is sometimes combined with ketoconazole in some shampoo formulations for enhanced antifungal activity.


## **Precautions**
