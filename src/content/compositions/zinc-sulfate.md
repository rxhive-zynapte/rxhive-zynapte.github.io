      What is the difference between elemental zinc and zinc sulfate?**

      **A:** Zinc sulfate is a salt form of zinc.  Elemental zinc refers to the
      amount of actual zinc present in the compound.  Dosage recommendations are
      often given in terms of elemental zinc.  Ensure you understand which form
      is being referenced.  For example, zinc sulfate contains about 23%
      elemental zinc.

## **Usage**

- Zinc sulfate is prescribed for the treatment and prevention of zinc deficiency. This includes patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica, diarrhea (especially in children), Wilson's disease, and those at high risk of deficiency due to malnutrition or malabsorption. It is also used as a dietary supplement.
- **Pharmacological classification:**  Trace element, mineral supplement.
- **Mechanism of action:** Zinc is an essential trace element crucial for numerous physiological functions, including enzymatic activity, protein synthesis, DNA synthesis, immune function, and cell growth and differentiation. Supplementation replenishes deficient zinc levels, restoring these normal functions. It also aids in reducing the duration and severity of diarrhea.


## **Alternate Names**

- Zinc sulfate heptahydrate, zinc sulfate monohydrate, white vitriol
- **Brand names:** Orazinc, Eye-Sed, Zinc-220, Bio-Logical Zinc, Zincaps, Galzin


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Zinc is a cofactor for over 300 enzymes and plays a vital role in various cellular processes. It stabilizes cell membranes, influences hormone release, modulates immune responses, and is crucial for wound healing. In diarrhea, zinc may reduce fluid loss and improve intestinal barrier function.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Oral absorption of zinc is variable (20-40%) and is affected by food, especially phytates found in grains and legumes. Absorption is enhanced in an acidic environment.  Intravenous administration bypasses absorption.
    - **Distribution:** Zinc is primarily stored in skeletal muscle and bone. It is also found in various organs like the liver, kidneys, pancreas, and eyes.
    - **Metabolism:** Zinc is not metabolized in the traditional sense.
    - **Elimination:** Primarily excreted through feces, with a small portion via urine.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Dietary supplement:** 50 mg elemental zinc once daily orally.
- **Parenteral nutrition additive:** 2.5â€“4 mg elemental zinc/day IV. Dosages may be higher for patients with large fluid loss.


#### **Children:**

- **Dosage varies based on age, weight, and indication:**
    - **Parenteral nutrition:** Consult pediatric dosing charts (e.g., Table 1 in source 24). Consider 1 mg/mL concentration for children <12 kg.
    - **Diarrhea:** 10 mg elemental zinc daily (children <6 months) or 20 mg daily (children >6 months) for 10-14 days.
    - **Other indications:** Based on the specific condition and severity of zinc deficiency. Consider 0.5-1 mg elemental zinc/kg/day, divided into 1-3 doses.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Refer to adult dosing, but consider renal function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  Use with caution; zinc accumulation may occur. Close monitoring of zinc levels is recommended. Dose adjustment might be necessary.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** No specific dose adjustments are typically necessary.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Individualize dosage. Consider interactions with other medications.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

- **Intubation/Surgical Procedures/Mechanical Ventilation/ICU Use:** Zinc supplementation is often included in parenteral nutrition regimens to prevent deficiency in critically ill patients. Dosage depends on the individual patient's metabolic state, nutritional needs, and fluid losses.
- **Emergency Situations:** Not typically used in emergency situations, except for possibly repleting severe zinc deficiency in specific cases.


### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Individualize dosage adjustments according to renal function, other medical conditions, and concurrent medications. Monitor serum zinc levels to guide adjustments.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects**

- Nausea
- Stomach upset, heartburn, dyspepsia
- Abdominal cramps, vomiting, diarrhea (with high doses)
- Metallic taste in the mouth


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

- Signs of infection (fever, chills, persistent sore throat)
- Mouth sores
- Unusual tiredness or weakness
- Copper deficiency (with prolonged high-dose zinc)


### **Long-Term Effects**

- Copper deficiency (with prolonged high-dose zinc)
- Immune dysfunction (with excessive doses)


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

- Allergic reactions (hives, difficulty breathing, swelling)


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to zinc sulfate or any components of the formulation.


## **Drug Interactions**

- **Tetracycline antibiotics, quinolone antibiotics, bisphosphonates:** Zinc reduces absorption. Separate administration times by at least 2 hours.
- **Penicillamine, trientine:** Mutual reduction of absorption. Separate administration times.
- **Iron, calcium salts:** Reduce zinc absorption. Separate administration times.
- **Thiazide diuretics:** Increase urinary zinc excretion.
- **Other drugs:** Numerous other potential interactions exist (over 140 known). Consult a drug interaction checker for detailed information.
- **Food:** Phytates in grains and legumes, dairy products containing calcium, and phosphorus-containing products inhibit zinc absorption. Alcohol may increase zinc elimination.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Normal dietary intake is considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. 
- Safety of higher supplemental doses is unclear. Consult with a healthcare professional before using supplements exceeding the RDA during these periods.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Essential trace element involved in enzyme function, protein and DNA synthesis, immune function, and cell growth.
- **Side Effects:** Nausea, stomach upset, metallic taste, abdominal pain, diarrhea (high doses).
- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to zinc sulfate.
- **Drug Interactions:** Numerous; see drug interaction section.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Normal dietary intake is safe. High-dose supplementation needs evaluation.
- **Dosage:** Varies by age, indication, and administration route. See dosage section.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Serum zinc levels, especially with high doses or renal impairment.


## **Popular Combinations**

- Oral rehydration salts (for diarrhea)


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Monitor for gastrointestinal side effects. Assess renal function in patients with renal impairment. Monitor copper status with long-term, high-dose use.
- **Specific Populations:** As outlined in the special cases section.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Alcohol may affect zinc elimination. Avoid consuming large amounts of phytate-rich foods concurrently with zinc supplements.
