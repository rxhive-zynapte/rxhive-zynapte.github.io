## **Usage**

- Zinc is an essential trace element crucial for cell growth, immune function, wound healing, DNA synthesis, and numerous other bodily processes. It is prescribed for the prevention and treatment of zinc deficiency, which can manifest as growth retardation, impaired immune function, delayed wound healing, hypogonadism, hair loss, skin lesions, and diarrhea.  It's also used to treat Wilson's disease, acrodermatitis enteropathica, and  may be beneficial as an adjunct treatment for diarrhea, common cold, and COVID-19.  It is being investigated for potential benefits in managing other conditions, including acne, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and diabetes, but further research is needed.
- **Pharmacological classification**:  Zinc is classified as a nutrient replenisher/supplement. However, at pharmacological doses, it can have other effects, such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

## **Alternate Names**

-  Elemental Zinc
-  Zn
- **Brand names**:  There are various brand names depending on the zinc salt used, such as Zincate, Galzin, Orazinc, and many others. Brand names also vary significantly by region and country.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Zinc is a cofactor for over 300 enzymes involved in various metabolic pathways. It is crucial for DNA synthesis, RNA transcription, cell division, protein synthesis, and immune function.  Zinc also plays a role in gene expression, cell signaling, and apoptosis.
- **Pharmacokinetics**:
    - **Absorption**: Zinc is primarily absorbed in the small intestine, particularly the duodenum and jejunum. The absorption rate varies depending on the dietary source and the presence of other dietary factors like phytates and fiber, which can inhibit absorption.
    - **Distribution**: Following absorption, zinc is bound to plasma proteins, mainly albumin, and transported to various tissues. It is stored in skeletal muscle, bone, liver, kidneys, and skin. 
    - **Metabolism**: Zinc is not metabolized in the typical sense. Its homeostasis is regulated mainly through absorption and excretion.
    - **Elimination**: Zinc is primarily excreted in the feces, with small amounts lost in urine and sweat.
- **Mode of action**:  Zinc exerts its effects by acting as a structural component of many proteins and enzymes.  It is also involved in maintaining the integrity of cell membranes and protecting against oxidative stress.  
- **Receptor binding/enzyme inhibition**: While zinc itself does not typically bind to receptors in the same way drugs do, it influences numerous enzyme activities, either as a cofactor or through modulating their activity.



## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults**:

- **Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)**:
    - Men: 11 mg/day
    - Women: 8 mg/day
- **Therapeutic dosages**:  15-30 mg of elemental zinc per day for treating zinc deficiency. Dosages up to 40 mg daily are generally considered safe for short-term use.  However, higher doses may be used under medical supervision for specific conditions.

#### **Children**:

- The RDA varies based on age, from 2 mg/day for infants to 11 mg/day for adolescents.  Pediatric dosing should be determined based on the child's age, weight, and specific needs.

#### **Special Cases**:

- **Elderly Patients**:  Elderly individuals may have reduced zinc absorption and may require supplementation.  However, it's important to monitor serum zinc levels to avoid exceeding the tolerable upper intake level (UL).
- **Patients with Renal Impairment**: Dose adjustment is generally not required in patients with renal impairment, but monitoring serum zinc levels is recommended.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction**:  In severe liver disease, zinc metabolism can be altered. Monitoring serum zinc levels is essential.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions**:  Certain conditions, such as diabetes, may affect zinc status. Dose adjustments might be necessary based on the individual patient's condition.


### **Clinical Use Cases**:

The dosage of zinc supplements can vary depending on the specific clinical condition:

- **Diarrhea**: 20 mg daily for 10-14 days is recommended by WHO for children with acute diarrhea.
- **Common Cold**: Dosages from 75-150 mg of zinc gluconate or acetate lozenges have been used.  However, not all studies support their effectiveness.
- **Wilson's Disease**: 25-50 mg three times daily of elemental zinc is prescribed.
- **Wound healing**:  Supplementation may be used for promoting wound healing in patients with zinc deficiency.
- The dosages for other clinical use cases like **Intubation**, **Surgical Procedures**, **Mechanical Ventilation**, **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**, and **Emergency Situations** are not explicitly mentioned in the sources.

### **Dosage Adjustments**:

- Dose adjustments should be made based on the patient's serum zinc levels, clinical response, and any underlying conditions that may affect zinc metabolism.


## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**:

- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Abdominal cramps

- **Copper**: High doses of zinc can impair copper absorption.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category**: A (when taken within RDA). However, higher doses should be used with caution and only under medical supervision.
- Zinc is essential for fetal development, but excessive intake may be harmful.
- Zinc is excreted in breast milk.  Breastfeeding mothers should ensure adequate zinc intake but avoid excessive supplementation.
