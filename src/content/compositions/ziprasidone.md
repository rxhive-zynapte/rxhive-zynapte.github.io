## **Usage**

Ziprasidone is an atypical antipsychotic prescribed for:

*   **Schizophrenia:**  A chronic brain disorder affecting a person's ability to think, feel, and behave clearly.
*   **Bipolar I Disorder:** A mental illness that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, concentration, and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. Ziprasidone is used to treat acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, both as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate for maintenance.

Its pharmacological classification is **atypical antipsychotic**.

Ziprasidone's mechanism of action involves antagonizing dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, along with modulating serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT2C receptors. This combined action is believed to contribute to its antipsychotic and mood-stabilizing effects.



## **Alternate Names**

Ziprasidone is also known by the brand name **Geodon**, and **Zeldox**.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Ziprasidone primarily exerts its therapeutic effects by antagonizing dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in the brain. Additionally, it interacts with several other serotonin receptor subtypes, including 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT2C.  It has minimal affinity for histamine H1 and muscarinic M1 receptors, leading to a relatively low incidence of certain side effects like sedation and weight gain compared to some other antipsychotics.

**Pharmacokinetics:**

*   **Absorption:**  Absorption is enhanced when taken with food (at least 500 calories).
*   **Metabolism:** Ziprasidone is extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 enzyme.
*   **Elimination:** Ziprasidone and its metabolites are eliminated through both renal (kidney) and hepatic (liver) pathways.

**Mode of Action:** At a cellular level, ziprasidone binds to and blocks the dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, modulating neurotransmission. It also interacts with serotonin 5HT1A, 5HT1D, and 5HT2C receptors. This multifaceted receptor interaction is thought to underlie its clinical effectiveness in managing schizophrenia and bipolar mania.


## **Dosage**



### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

*   **Schizophrenia:** Initial dose is 20 mg twice daily with food. The dose can be increased to a maximum of 80 mg twice daily, with adjustments made at intervals of at least two days.
*   **Bipolar Mania:** Initial dose is 40 mg twice daily with food. This can be increased to 60-80 mg twice daily on the second day, with subsequent adjustments as needed, but not exceeding 80 mg twice daily.

#### **Children:**

Ziprasidone is not recommended for use in children under 18 years old.



#### **Special Cases:**

*   **Elderly Patients:** A lower starting dose and slower titration are advisable in some elderly patients due to possible increased pharmacodynamic response, lower tolerance, and risk of orthostasis.
*   **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment is not necessary for oral ziprasidone.  Caution is advised for intramuscular administration.
*   **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Lower doses should be considered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.  Use cautiously in severe hepatic impairment.
*   **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dosage adjustments may be necessary for patients with specific comorbid conditions like cardiovascular disease or diabetes, especially if interacting medications are used.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

*   **Intubation, Surgical Procedures, Mechanical Ventilation, ICU Use, Emergency Situations:**  These scenarios are generally outside the scope of ziprasidone's indicated uses, except for the management of acute agitation in patients with schizophrenia using the intramuscular formulation (10-20 mg IM, repeatable every 2-4 hours up to 40 mg/day for up to 3 days).



### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage modification may be required in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, or genetic polymorphisms impacting drug metabolism. Monitor patients closely and adjust dosage according to their individual response and tolerability.





## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, constipation, restlessness, anxiety, lack of energy, muscle or stomach pain, runny nose, cough, weight gain.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

QT prolongation (a heart rhythm problem), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), tardive dyskinesia (TD - a movement disorder), hyperglycemia, allergic reactions (skin rash, itching, hives, swelling).

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Tardive dyskinesia, weight gain, metabolic changes (high blood sugar, high cholesterol).

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

NMS, QT prolongation, severe allergic reactions, and other serious side effects noted above require immediate intervention.

## **Contraindications**

*   Hypersensitivity to ziprasidone.
*   Conditions that prolong the QT interval, including congenital long QT syndrome.
*   Recent acute myocardial infarction.
*   Uncompensated heart failure.
*   Concomitant use with medications known to prolong the QT interval.

## **Drug Interactions**

Ziprasidone interacts with a number of medications, including:

*   Drugs that prolong the QT interval (e.g., certain antibiotics, antiarrhythmics, antidepressants).
*   CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers (e.g., ketoconazole, carbamazepine).
*   CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids).
*   Antihypertensives.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

*   **Pregnancy:** Ziprasidone is classified as Pregnancy Category C. Its use during pregnancy should be considered only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Neonates exposed to antipsychotics during the third trimester are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms.
*   **Breastfeeding:** Breastfeeding is generally not recommended while taking ziprasidone due to the potential for adverse effects in the nursing infant.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

*   **Mechanism of Action:** Dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, with additional serotonin receptor modulation.
*   **Side Effects:** Common:  Drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, constipation. Serious: QT prolongation, NMS, TD.
*   **Contraindications:** Long QT syndrome, recent MI, uncompensated heart failure, hypersensitivity.
*   **Drug Interactions:** Numerous; see above.
*   **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks during pregnancy; breastfeeding not recommended.
*   **Dosage:** Schizophrenia: 20-80 mg BID; Bipolar mania: 40-80 mg BID.  Adjust based on individual patient response and tolerability.
*   **Monitoring Parameters:**  ECG (for QT interval), weight, blood glucose, lipids, extrapyramidal symptoms.

## **Popular Combinations**

Ziprasidone may be used in combination with lithium or valproate for maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder.

## **Precautions**

Screen for allergies, cardiac conditions (especially those affecting the QT interval), and other relevant medical history. Exercise caution in elderly patients, and those with renal or hepatic impairment. Monitor for metabolic changes.
