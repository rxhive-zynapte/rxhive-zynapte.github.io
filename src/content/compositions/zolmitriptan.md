## **Usage**

- Zolmitriptan is prescribed for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura. It is not intended for preventative therapy or for hemiplegic, basilar, or ophthalmoplegic migraines.  Its efficacy for cluster headaches has not been established.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Selective serotonin receptor agonist (5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> agonist), Antimigraine agent.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Zolmitriptan selectively binds to 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptors, primarily in cranial blood vessels, resulting in vasoconstriction and inhibition of neuropeptide release, thus relieving migraine pain.

## **Alternate Names**
- Sometimes referred to as simply "zolmitriptan."
- **Brand Names:** Zomig, Zomig Rapimelt, Zomig Nasal Spray, and others depending on the region and manufacturer.


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Zolmitriptan acts by constricting cranial blood vessels and inhibiting the release of vasoactive neuropeptides, believed to play a key role in migraine pathophysiology.  It also inhibits trigeminal nerve activation.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:**  Orally administered zolmitriptan has a bioavailability of approximately 40%. Food does not significantly affect absorption.  Nasal spray has faster absorption through the nasal mucosa.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP1A2 and monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A). The active metabolite, N-desmethyl-zolmitriptan, also contributes to the therapeutic effect.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted mainly through the kidneys (approximately 65%) and feces (approximately 30%). Elimination half-life is about 3 hours.
- **Mode of Action:** Zolmitriptan selectively agonizes 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors, leading to vasoconstriction of intracranial arteries and inhibition of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptor agonism. It inhibits the release of vasoactive neuropeptides, including CGRP.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Oral:** Initial dose: 1.25 mg or 2.5 mg. A second dose may be taken after 2 hours if the migraine persists or recurs.
- **Nasal Spray:** Initial dose: 2.5 mg or 5 mg sprayed into one nostril. A second dose may be taken after 2 hours if needed.
- Maximum daily dose for both oral and nasal spray is 10 mg in a 24-hour period.

#### **Children:**
- Use is not recommended for children under 12 years of age, as safety and efficacy have not been established.  Limited data exists for adolescents (12-17 years), and use is generally not recommended in this age group.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients (over 65):**  Use with caution; initiate at the lower end of the dosing range (1.25 mg) due to potential for age-related decrease in drug clearance and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  No dose adjustment is necessary for mild to moderate impairment. For severe impairment (creatinine clearance <15 mL/min), zolmitriptan is contraindicated.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** For mild to moderate impairment, no dose adjustment is typically needed. For severe hepatic impairment, a maximum dose of 5 mg in 24 hours is recommended; alternatively, start with a lower dose of 1.25 mg.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:**  Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes. Careful consideration and dose adjustments may be necessary.


### **Clinical Use Cases**
Zolmitriptan is specifically indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks.  It does not have a role in:
- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations** (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest)


### **Dosage Adjustments**
- **Coadministration with CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin):**  Maximum single dose of zolmitriptan should not exceed 2.5 mg, and the maximum daily dose should not exceed 5 mg.
- **MAO-A inhibitors:** Maximum dose of 5 mg in 24 hours.


## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**
- Dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, dry mouth, asthenia, paresthesia, somnolence, warm or cold sensation, unusual taste (with nasal spray), and nasal discomfort (with nasal spray).


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**
- Myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina), cardiac arrhythmias, serotonin syndrome, allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), and hypertension.



### **Long-Term Effects:**
- Medication overuse headache may develop with frequent use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**
- Severe allergic reactions, chest pain or tightness, myocardial infarction, and stroke require immediate medical attention.



## **Contraindications**

- Ischemic heart disease, history of myocardial infarction, Prinzmetal's angina, uncontrolled hypertension, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), transient ischemic attack (TIA), peripheral vascular disease, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and other cardiac arrhythmias.
- Hypersensitivity to zolmitriptan or any of its components.
- Concomitant use with ergotamine-containing drugs or other 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> agonists.
- Severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <15 mL/min).


## **Drug Interactions**
- **CYP1A2 Inhibitors:**  Cimetidine, fluvoxamine, and quinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin) increase zolmitriptan levels. Dose reduction is required.
- **MAO Inhibitors:** Concomitant use can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. Use with caution and at a reduced dose.
- **Serotonergic Drugs:** SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, and other drugs affecting serotonin levels may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome.
- **Ergot Alkaloids:**  Combined use can cause prolonged vasoconstriction and is contraindicated.


## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  C (limited human data available).  Use only if potential benefits outweigh the risks to the fetus.
- **Breastfeeding:**  Zolmitriptan is present in breast milk.  It is recommended to interrupt breastfeeding for 24 hours after administration to minimize infant exposure.  Alternatively, consider sumatriptan or eletriptan.



## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptor agonist, causing cranial vasoconstriction and inhibiting CGRP release.
- **Side Effects:** Common: Dizziness, drowsiness, nausea.  Serious: Myocardial infarction, stroke, serotonin syndrome.
- **Contraindications:** Cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hypertension, CVA/TIA, WPW syndrome, severe renal impairment.
- **Drug Interactions:**  CYP1A2 inhibitors, MAO inhibitors, ergot alkaloids, serotonergic drugs.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:**  Category C; use with caution. Interrupt breastfeeding for 24 hours after dose.
- **Dosage:**  Initial: 1.25-2.5 mg oral/nasal. Maximum: 10 mg/24 hours. Adjustments needed for hepatic impairment and drug interactions.
- **Monitoring Parameters:** Blood pressure, heart rate, and symptoms of serotonin syndrome or cardiovascular events.


## **Popular Combinations**
Zolmitriptan is typically used as monotherapy for acute migraine treatment. Combination with other antimigraine drugs like NSAIDs or triptans is generally avoided due to the risk of additive side effects and drug interactions.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Assess cardiovascular risk factors before initiating therapy. Monitor blood pressure.  Ensure correct diagnosis of migraine to avoid use in conditions mimicking migraine with potentially serious underlying pathology.
- **Specific Populations:** As detailed in the "Special Cases" section above.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Avoiding migraine triggers like certain foods, stress, and sleep deprivation can help reduce migraine frequency.
