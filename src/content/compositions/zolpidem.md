## **Usage**

- Zolpidem is prescribed for the short-term treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep initiation.  It may also be used for sleep maintenance.
- **Pharmacological classification:** Zolpidem is classified as a sedative-hypnotic and is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic of the imidazopyridine class.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Zolpidem acts as an agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor's omega-1 subtype. This interaction enhances the inhibitory effects of GABA, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, leading to sedation and sleep.

## **Alternate Names** 

- Zolpidem doesn't have many alternate names. It is sometimes referred to as Zolpidem Tartrate, which denotes the tartrate salt form of the drug.  
- **Brand names:** Ambien, Ambien CR, Edluar, Intermezzo, Zolpimist.

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Zolpidem enhances the effect of GABA by binding to the benzodiazepine-1 (BZ1) receptor on the GABAA receptor complex. This promotes chloride influx into neurons, leading to hyperpolarization and decreased neuronal excitability in the central nervous system, promoting sleep.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Zolpidem is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Food reduces the rate and extent of absorption. Sublingual formulations bypass first-pass metabolism, leading to faster onset of action.
    - **Metabolism:** Zolpidem is primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4 enzymes.  
    - **Elimination:** The metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine.
- **Mode of Action:** Zolpidem selectively binds to the BZ1 receptor subtype of the GABAA receptor complex, modulating the receptor's response to GABA and enhancing its inhibitory effects.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4 followed by renal excretion of metabolites.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- **Immediate-release:** Initial dose: 5 mg for women and 5 mg or 10 mg for men taken orally once daily immediately before bedtime.  The dose can be increased to 10 mg if the 5 mg dose is ineffective. Do not exceed 10 mg per day.  Administer only if at least 7-8 hours remain before the planned time of awakening.
- **Extended-release:** Initial dose: 6.25 mg for women and 6.25 mg or 12.5 mg for men taken orally once daily immediately before bedtime. The dose can be increased to 12.5 mg if the 6.25 mg dose is ineffective.  Do not exceed 12.5 mg per day.  Administer only if at least 7-8 hours remain before the planned time of awakening.
- **Sublingual (for sleep onset):** Initial dose: 5 mg for women and 5 mg or 10 mg for men. If the 5 mg dose is not effective, it may be increased to 10 mg. Do not exceed 10 mg per day, taken immediately before bedtime.
- **Sublingual (for middle-of-the-night awakening):** 1.75 mg for women and 3.5 mg for men, only once per night if at least 4 hours remain before the planned time of awakening.

#### **Children:**

Zolpidem is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  Initial dose 5 mg for immediate-release or sublingual formulations and 6.25 mg for extended-release formulations.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dosage adjustment may not be necessary but close monitoring is recommended.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Initial dose 5 mg for all formulations. Avoid use in severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Dose adjustments may be necessary based on the specific comorbidity and other medications the patient is taking. Consult relevant guidelines.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

The use of zolpidem is primarily indicated for short-term management of insomnia, and its clinical use in the settings described below is generally not recommended, especially for extended durations. Other sedative-hypnotics or anesthetic agents are typically more appropriate for these specific scenarios.

- **Intubation:**  Not typically indicated.
- **Surgical Procedures:**  Not typically indicated for intraoperative sedation or anesthesia.
- **Mechanical Ventilation:** Not typically indicated.
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use:**  Not recommended due to the risk of delirium.
- **Emergency Situations:** Not typically indicated.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dose modifications are based on patient-specific factors, including renal or hepatic dysfunction and concomitant medications, especially CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects**

Drowsiness, dizziness, headache, diarrhea, nausea, daytime fatigue.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects**

Angioedema, anaphylaxis, complex sleep behaviors (sleepwalking, sleep-eating, sleep-driving), hallucinations, worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts.

### **Long-Term Effects**

Potential for dependence and tolerance with prolonged use. Rebound insomnia may occur upon discontinuation.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR)**

Severe anaphylactic reactions require immediate medical attention. Complex sleep behaviors should be carefully monitored.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to zolpidem.
- Severe hepatic insufficiency.
- Obstructive sleep apnea.
- Myasthenia gravis.
- Acute or severe respiratory depression.
- Previous history of complex sleep behaviors after taking zolpidem.

## **Drug Interactions**

- CNS depressants (alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines): Additive effects, increased risk of respiratory depression.
- CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin): Increased zolpidem levels.
- CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's Wort): Decreased zolpidem levels.
- Other medications: Refer to comprehensive drug interaction resources for specific interactions.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  C (Consult specialist).
- **Fetal risks:**  May cause respiratory depression and sedation in neonates. There are limited reports of moderate to severe neonatal respiratory depression requiring artificial ventilation or intratracheal intubation when zolpidem was used late in pregnancy.  
- **Breastfeeding:**  Zolpidem is excreted in breast milk. Potential for neonatal sedation and respiratory depression.  Consider the risks and benefits.  
- Safer alternative options should be considered during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
