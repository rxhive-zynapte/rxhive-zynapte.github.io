## **Usage**

- Zonisamide is an anticonvulsant medication used as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of partial seizures, with or without secondary generalization, in adults and children 6 years of age and older. It is also sometimes used off-label for binge-eating disorder.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Anticonvulsant.
- Zonisamide's mechanism of action is not fully understood but is thought to involve multiple mechanisms, including blockade of voltage-gated sodium and T-type calcium channels, which reduces neuronal excitability and inhibits the spread of seizure activity.

## **Alternate Names**

- Zonegran (brand name)
- Zonisade (brand name for oral suspension)


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Zonisamide stabilizes neuronal membranes by blocking voltage-gated sodium and T-type calcium channels, decreasing neuronal excitability. It may also enhance the inhibitory effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Well-absorbed orally, with peak plasma concentrations reached within 2-6 hours. Food delays but does not affect overall absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Primarily metabolized in the liver, mainly by CYP3A4.
    - **Elimination:** Excreted by the kidneys, with a half-life of approximately 63 hours.

- **Mode of Action:** Zonisamide blocks voltage-gated sodium channels, inhibiting repetitive neuronal firing. It also blocks T-type calcium channels, suppressing sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. These actions decrease neuronal excitability. Zonisamide does not appear to enhance GABAergic transmission or affect glutamate receptors.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily renal excretion, with a minor contribution from hepatic metabolism via CYP3A4.



## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: 100 mg orally once a day.
- Titration:  Increase at 2-week intervals by 100 mg/day, up to a maximum of 600 mg/day. The dose may be divided twice daily.
- Usual maintenance dose: 300-400 mg/day.


#### **Children (6 years and older):**

- Initial dose: 1 mg/kg orally once a day.
- Titration: Increase weekly by 1 mg/kg/day, up to a maximum dose of 8 mg/kg/day or 500 mg/day, whichever is less.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start at a lower dose and titrate more slowly due to potential age-related decline in renal and hepatic function.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Titrate dose more slowly and frequently monitor renal function. Avoid use in patients with GFR < 50 mL/min.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Titrate dose more slowly in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Not recommended for severe hepatic impairment.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** No specific dosage adjustments are routinely recommended for patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease. However, monitor closely for adverse effects.


### **Clinical Use Cases**

Zonisamide is not indicated for use in acute settings such as:

- **Intubation**
- **Surgical Procedures**
- **Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Use**
- **Emergency Situations** (e.g., status epilepticus, cardiac arrest)


### **Dosage Adjustments**

Adjustments may be needed for patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Titrate slowly and monitor closely.  Drug interactions with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine) may require a higher zonisamide dose, while CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) necessitate a lower dose.




## **Side Effects**


### **Common Side Effects:**

- Drowsiness, fatigue, dizziness
- Loss of appetite, weight loss
- Nausea, abdominal pain
- Cognitive impairment (memory and concentration problems)
- Headache


### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Severe skin reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis)
- Suicidal ideation, worsening depression
- Metabolic acidosis
- Kidney stones
- Blood dyscrasias
- Hyperammonemia


### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Osteopenia (with chronic metabolic acidosis)
- Cognitive impairment
- Growth retardation in children

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Angioedema, anaphylaxis
- Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)


## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to zonisamide or sulfonamides
- Severe hepatic impairment


## **Drug Interactions**

- **CYP3A4 Inducers:** (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, St. John's wort) may decrease zonisamide levels.
- **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin) may increase zonisamide levels.
- **Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors:** (e.g., acetazolamide) may increase the risk of metabolic acidosis.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:** C.  Zonisamide should be avoided during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus.  There is a risk of fetal harm, including major congenital malformations and decreased fetal growth. 
- Zonisamide is excreted in breast milk. Breastfeeding should not be resumed until one month after discontinuing zonisamide.


## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Contraindications:** Hypersensitivity to zonisamide or sulfonamides; severe hepatic impairment.
- **Drug Interactions:**  CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Avoid during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 100-600 mg/day; Children: 1-8 mg/kg/day or up to 500 mg/day.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Renal function, liver function, serum bicarbonate, complete blood count, mental status, growth in children.


## **Popular Combinations**

Zonisamide is often used in combination with other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as levetiracetam, lamotrigine, or valproate, to achieve better seizure control.


## **Precautions**

- **General Precautions:** Monitor for suicidal thoughts, skin reactions, metabolic acidosis, kidney stones, and blood dyscrasias. Monitor growth in children.
- **Specific Populations:**
    - **Pregnant Women:** Avoid if possible.
    - **Breastfeeding Mothers:**  Discontinue breastfeeding or the drug.
    - **Children & Elderly:** Adjust dose based on age and renal/hepatic function.
- **Lifestyle Considerations:** Advise patients about potential drowsiness and cognitive impairment and their impact on driving and operating machinery.  Advise patients to maintain adequate hydration to reduce the risk of kidney stones.
