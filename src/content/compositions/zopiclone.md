## **Usage**

- Zopiclone is primarily prescribed for the short-term treatment of insomnia in adults. This includes difficulty falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and early morning awakenings.  It is typically used for 7-14 days.
- **Pharmacological Classification:**  Nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic, also categorized as a cyclopyrrolone.
- **Mechanism of Action:** Zopiclone enhances the activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.  It binds to a specific site on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor complex, distinct from the benzodiazepine binding site, facilitating GABA's inhibitory effects and promoting sleep.

## **Alternate Names**

- No widely recognized alternate names exist for Zopiclone itself.
- **Brand Names:** Imovane, Zimovane, Dopareel


## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:**  Zopiclone produces hypnotic effects, including sedation, muscle relaxation, and anticonvulsant activity, via its action on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Zopiclone is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1.5-2 hours. Food does not significantly affect absorption.
    - **Metabolism:** Extensively metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 enzymes into two major metabolites: *N*-desmethylzopiclone (active) and *N*-oxide zopiclone (inactive).
    - **Elimination:**  Eliminated primarily through hepatic metabolism, with metabolites excreted mainly in urine and a smaller amount in feces. Its elimination half-life is approximately 5 hours.
- **Mode of Action:**  Zopiclone binds to a specific site on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor complex, increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening. This enhances GABA's inhibitory effects, leading to neuronal hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability, promoting sleep.
- **Receptor Binding, Enzyme Inhibition, or Neurotransmitter Modulation:** Binds to a site on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor complex, modulating GABAergic neurotransmission. It does not directly inhibit or induce CYP enzymes, although its metabolism is CYP-dependent.
- **Elimination Pathways:** Primarily hepatic metabolism with renal excretion of metabolites.


## **Dosage**


### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- The recommended dose is 7.5 mg orally, taken immediately before bedtime. This dose should not be exceeded.

#### **Children:**

- Zopiclone is contraindicated in children and adolescents under 18 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established in this population.


#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:**  An initial dose of 3.75 mg is recommended, which may be increased to 7.5 mg if necessary, based on clinical response and tolerability.
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**  An initial dose of 3.75 mg is recommended.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:**  A lower initial dose of 3.75 mg is recommended due to potentially reduced clearance. The dose may be cautiously increased to 7.5 mg if needed and tolerated.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Use with caution in patients with respiratory insufficiency. An initial lower dose of 3.75 mg is recommended.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Zopiclone is not typically used in settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU use, or emergency situations. Its primary indication is short-term treatment of insomnia.  For these clinical use cases, other agents, such as benzodiazepines and propofol, are generally preferred.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dose adjustments are necessary for elderly patients, those with renal or hepatic impairment, and those with respiratory insufficiency, as described above.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- **Pregnancy Safety Category:**  C (Evidence of fetal risk in animals; no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant women).
- Zopiclone crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk. Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is contraindicated due to potential risks to the fetus/infant.

- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
- **Dosage:** Adults: 7.5 mg orally before bedtime; elderly/hepatic/renal impairment: initial 3.75 mg.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Respiratory rate, liver function tests (if used long-term).


## **Popular Combinations**

- Zopiclone is not typically used in combination with other drugs for insomnia.  Concomitant use of other CNS depressants should be avoided.

## **Precautions**

-  Assess patients for history of substance abuse, respiratory or hepatic impairment.
-  Avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants.
