## **Usage**

- Zotepine is prescribed for the treatment of schizophrenia, a chronic mental illness affecting a person's ability to think, feel, and behave.  It is also sometimes used to treat other psychotic disorders.
- **Pharmacological Classification:** Zotepine is classified as an atypical antipsychotic (second-generation antipsychotic).
- **Mechanism of Action:** Zotepine primarily acts as an antagonist at dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the brain, but also interacts with serotonin, adrenergic (Î±1), and histamine (H1) receptors. It inhibits noradrenaline reuptake as well. This combined action helps alleviate both positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, paranoia) and negative symptoms (withdrawal, lack of motivation, emotional flatness) of schizophrenia.

## **Alternate Names**

- Zoleptil (Brand name)

## **How It Works**

- **Pharmacodynamics:** Zotepine's therapeutic effects are attributed to its combined antagonism at various receptors, primarily dopamine D1 and D2 receptors. This receptor blockade reduces dopaminergic neurotransmission in the brain, believed to be responsible for the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. It influences other neurotransmitter systems to improve negative and potentially the cognitive symptoms as well.
- **Pharmacokinetics:**
    - **Absorption:** Zotepine is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.
    - **Metabolism:** Zotepine undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism, primarily via CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 enzymes.
    - **Elimination:**  Zotepine is excreted primarily in the urine and feces, with a small amount of unchanged drug excreted.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

- Initial dose: 25 mg three times daily.
- The dosage can be increased gradually at intervals of 4 days, if needed.
- Maximum dose:  100 mg three times daily (300 mg total daily dose).

#### **Children:**

- Zotepine is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age.

#### **Special Cases:**

- **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose of 25 mg twice daily and titrate cautiously to a maximum of 75 mg twice daily. 
- **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Start with 25 mg twice daily and titrate cautiously to a maximum of 75 mg twice daily. Monitor renal function.
- **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Start with 25 mg twice daily and titrate cautiously to a maximum of 75 mg twice daily. Monitor liver function tests, particularly during the first three months of therapy.
- **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, history of seizures, or other medical conditions. Dosage adjustments and monitoring might be necessary.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

- Zotepine is not typically used in clinical settings like intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, ICU, or emergency situations. Its primary indication is the management of schizophrenia. For procedures or conditions requiring sedation or muscle relaxation, other medications are typically preferred.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

- Dosage adjustments may be necessary based on the individual patient's response, tolerability, and clinical status.  Monitor for adverse effects and adjust dosage accordingly.
- Consider renal and hepatic function, other comorbid conditions, and drug interactions when making dosage adjustments.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**
- Somnolence, weight gain, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, tachycardia, hypotension, blurred vision, increased prolactin levels.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), seizures, blood dyscrasias (e.g., agranulocytosis, neutropenia), severe allergic reactions, QT prolongation.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

- Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a potential long-term side effect associated with antipsychotic use, including zotepine. Regular monitoring is essential.

### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

- Report any signs of NMS, seizures, blood dyscrasias, or severe allergic reactions immediately. These ADRs require prompt medical intervention.

## **Contraindications**

- Hypersensitivity to zotepine.
- Severe central nervous system (CNS) depression.
- History of epilepsy (personal or family history).
- Acute gout, history of nephrolithiasis.
- Pre-existing QT interval prolongation.
- Concomitant use of medications known to prolong the QT interval.
- Pregnancy and lactation.


## **Drug Interactions**

- Drugs that prolong the QT interval (e.g., certain antiarrhythmics, antibiotics).
- CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) may increase zotepine levels.
- CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, erythromycin).
- CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines).
- Antihypertensives.

## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

- Zotepine is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to potential risks to the fetus/infant.
- Safer alternative antipsychotics should be considered if treatment is absolutely necessary.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

- **Mechanism of Action:** Dopamine D1 and D2 receptor antagonist, serotonin receptor activity, noradrenaline reuptake inhibition.
- **Side Effects:** Somnolence, weight gain, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, extrapyramidal symptoms, NMS, seizures, QTc prolongation.
- **Contraindications:**  Hypersensitivity, epilepsy, gout, QT prolongation, pregnancy, breastfeeding.
- **Drug Interactions:** QT prolonging drugs, CYP1A2/3A4 inhibitors, CNS depressants.
- **Pregnancy & Breastfeeding:** Contraindicated.
- **Dosage:** Adults:  Initially 25 mg TID, titrate to max 300mg/day. Elderly: Start lower, max 150 mg/day.  Renal/Hepatic Impairment: Start lower, max 150mg/day.
- **Monitoring Parameters:**  Mental status, weight, ECG (QT interval), liver function tests, complete blood counts, extrapyramidal symptoms, signs of NMS.


## **Popular Combinations**

- Although sometimes used in combination with other medications for specific patient needs, zotepine is often used as monotherapy for schizophrenia. Combinations need careful consideration of potential drug interactions and side effects.


## **Precautions**

- Careful monitoring of patients for adverse effects is essential, especially during the initial phase of treatment and after dosage adjustments.
- Pre-existing medical conditions need careful evaluation and management.
- Patients should be advised about potential risks and benefits of zotepine therapy.
- Advise patients to avoid alcohol.
- Monitor ECG in patients at risk for QTc prolongation.
- Caution in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other relevant comorbid conditions.
