## **Usage**

Zuclopenthixol is primarily prescribed for the treatment of acute and chronic psychoses, including schizophrenia, particularly in cases presenting with hallucinations, delusions, thought disturbances, agitation, restlessness, hostility, or aggressiveness. It is also used in the manic phase of manic-depressive illness, and for managing mental retardation associated with psychomotor hyperactivity, agitation, violence, and other behavioral disturbances.  Additionally, it finds use in treating senile dementia with prominent paranoid ideation, confusion, disorientation, or behavioral issues.

Zuclopenthixol is classified as a thioxanthene antipsychotic, also known as a neuroleptic.

Its mechanism of action involves antagonism of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, as well as serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in the brain.  This receptor blockade helps alleviate the positive symptoms of psychosis.

## **Alternate Names**

Zuclopenthixol is also known internationally as Cisordinol, Acuphase, and Clopixol.  These are common brand names under which the drug is marketed in different regions.  Clopixol Acuphase is specifically used for the acetate ester formulation, while Clopixol Depot refers to the decanoate ester.

## **How It Works**

**Pharmacodynamics:** Zuclopenthixol exerts its antipsychotic effects primarily through the antagonism of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors.  Blockade of these receptors modulates neurotransmission in the brain, reducing the excessive dopaminergic and serotonergic activity believed to underlie the positive symptoms of psychosis like hallucinations and delusions. It also has some affinity for alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, which accounts for some of its side effects.

**Pharmacokinetics:**  Zuclopenthixol, administered orally, has enhanced bioavailability when taken with food (approximately 20% increase). However, this effect is not considered clinically significant. Zuclopenthixol acetate (Acuphase), given intramuscularly, provides rapid action for acute psychosis. Zuclopenthixol decanoate (Depot), also given intramuscularly, offers a long-acting effect, useful for maintenance therapy.  The drug is metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP2D6 and other CYP enzymes, and eliminated mainly through fecal excretion with a small portion (about 10%) via urine.

## **Dosage**

### **Standard Dosage**

#### **Adults:**

* **Oral (Zuclopenthixol hydrochloride):**  Initial dose is typically 20-30 mg/day in divided doses, adjustable to a usual maintenance dose of 20-50 mg/day. Severe or resistant cases may require up to 150 mg/day. The maximum single oral dose is 40 mg.

* **Intramuscular (Zuclopenthixol acetate - Acuphase):**  For acute psychoses, 50-150 mg IM.  Repeat injections can be given after 2-3 days if needed, with the total dose not exceeding 400 mg within a 2-week period (maximum 4 injections).

* **Intramuscular (Zuclopenthixol decanoate - Depot):**  For maintenance therapy, the usual dose is 200-400 mg every 2-4 weeks.  Some patients may require up to 600 mg per week, with a maximum single dose of 600 mg.  For patients new to depot antipsychotics, an initial test dose of 100 mg is recommended.

#### **Children:**  Zuclopenthixol is generally not recommended for children due to limited clinical data on safety and efficacy.

#### **Special Cases:**

* **Elderly Patients:** Start with a lower dose (e.g., one-quarter to one-half the usual adult dose) and titrate cautiously.

* **Patients with Renal Impairment:** Dose reduction may be necessary.  For acute psychosis (acetate formulation), consider half the normal dose in renal failure.

* **Patients with Hepatic Dysfunction:** Dose reduction is recommended.  In both acetate and oral formulations, half the normal dose is suggested for patients with hepatic impairment.

* **Patients with Comorbid Conditions:** Exercise caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, prostatic hypertrophy, glaucoma, and other conditions.  Dose adjustments may be required.

### **Clinical Use Cases**

Zuclopenthixol does not have a designated role in the context of intubation, surgical procedures, mechanical ventilation, or specific emergency situations like status epilepticus or cardiac arrest.  Its use is mainly focused on managing psychiatric conditions.  In an ICU setting, if a patient exhibits acute psychosis, the acetate form might be used for rapid tranquilization.

### **Dosage Adjustments**

Dosage should be adjusted based on individual patient response and tolerability. Renal and hepatic impairment necessitate dose reductions. Co-existing medical conditions may also influence dosage. Genetic polymorphisms affecting CYP2D6 activity should be considered, as slower metabolizers might require lower doses.

## **Side Effects**

### **Common Side Effects:**

Drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, blurred vision, extrapyramidal symptoms (muscle stiffness, tremor, restlessness), hyperprolactinemia (leading to galactorrhea, amenorrhea, sexual dysfunction), and postural hypotension.

### **Rare but Serious Side Effects:**

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), tardive dyskinesia, blood dyscrasias (neutropenia, leukopenia), cardiac arrhythmias (including QT prolongation), and severe allergic reactions.

### **Long-Term Effects:**

Tardive dyskinesia, weight gain, metabolic changes (e.g., dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia), and sexual dysfunction can occur with prolonged use.


### **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR):**

NMS, agranulocytosis, ventricular arrhythmias (torsade de pointes), and anaphylactic reactions require immediate medical intervention.



## **Contraindications**

Absolute contraindications include known hypersensitivity to thioxanthenes, comatose states, acute alcohol, barbiturate, or opiate intoxication, circulatory collapse, subcortical brain damage, blood dyscrasias, and phaeochromocytoma.

## **Drug Interactions**

Zuclopenthixol interacts with numerous medications, including CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines), antihypertensives (guanethidine), levodopa, metoclopramide, piperazine, drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (fluoxetine, paroxetine), drugs that prolong the QT interval (certain antiarrhythmics, some macrolides, antihistamines), and drugs causing electrolyte disturbances (thiazide diuretics).



## **Pregnancy and Breastfeeding**

Zuclopenthixol should generally be avoided during pregnancy, especially during the third trimester, due to potential risks to the fetus (extrapyramidal symptoms, withdrawal symptoms).  If the drug is absolutely necessary, careful monitoring of the newborn is essential.  Zuclopenthixol passes into breast milk, potentially causing adverse effects in infants.  Breastfeeding is generally discouraged during treatment.

## **Drug Profile Summary**

* **Mechanism of Action:** Dopamine D1 and D2, and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist.

## **Popular Combinations**

Zuclopenthixol is sometimes used in combination with other antipsychotics or mood stabilizers depending on the patient's specific needs and diagnosis. However, combining antipsychotics requires careful consideration of potential drug interactions and additive side effects.

## **Precautions**

Pre-screening for cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal conditions is crucial.  Monitor for extrapyramidal symptoms, NMS, and QT prolongation.  Caution advised in elderly patients, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and those with epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, or other relevant comorbidities. Patients should avoid alcohol and activities requiring alertness while taking zuclopenthixol.
